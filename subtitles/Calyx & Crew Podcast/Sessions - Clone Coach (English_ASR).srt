keeping healthy clones I know you were

13
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,259
interested in some of what I was doing

14
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,779

15
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,359
are joining us over here in chat

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,219
um have you know had problems with their

17
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,759
clones and are looking for tips and

18
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,159
advice on how to keep healthy clones and

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,039
get successful wraith throughout their

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,400
cloning and I think the big thing about

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,479
that is you need to start a good if

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,859
you're going to have a good house you

23
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,560
need need to build it on a good

24
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,560
foundation right which would include

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,420
keeping a healthy mother you're very

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,100
experienced in this if you guys aren't

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,740
familiar with the Clone coach you can go

28
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,559
catch him over at clonecoach.com he

29
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,419
actually does Consulting over there

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,939
um I know that you're doing 50 clones

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,460
per tray what what's your average tray

32
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,279
amount where are you ranging between

33
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,478
these different consultations you do

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,340
so it's

35
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,799
it's for clonecoach.com there's a

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,420
coaching program so I try to do this as

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,460
remote as possible so I could help as

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,618
many Gardens as possible right so

39
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,658
there's different coaching programs for

40
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:52,978
clones and mother plants and then if you

41
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,899
really want to get in depth and you're

42
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,239
doing commercial scale stuff there's an

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,000

covers should cover 100 of everything

48
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,520
you need to solve all the Clone problems

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,959
you're having and get you the best

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
clones ever same thing with the amount

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,039
of plan so it's a little package PDF

52
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,359
document

53
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,500
um a training video and a one-on-one

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,080
coaching call

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,239
awesome awesome man

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
um so like we were saying you know all

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,939
those cuts to get a successful rate most

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,580
of my Growers are home Growers so it's a

59
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,060
little bit smaller scale but you know if

60
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,200
you're keeping hundreds of literally

61
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,699
hundreds of cuts just between a couple

62
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,738
trays

63
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,139
um in a commercial setting it should be

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,539
more than easily possible to get four or

65
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,359
five good cuts off a mother in a home

66
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,219
growth situation uh but a big part of

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,739
that is having a healthy mother and I

68
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:55,019
think more often than not home Growers

69
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,939
skip that fact they don't have their

70
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,400
mother in perfect health before they

71
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:03,239
take those cuts and that's kind of like

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,239
a a setup for not for having bad success

73
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,519
right 100 I mean it

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,900
I started as a home grower right I

75
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,120
started with the small with the small

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,980
bedroom and before that was a closet

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,959
with some plants in it you know for

78
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,060
mother plants specifically you could

79
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,098
have a small closet have one mother

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,479
plant and one tray of clones that you

81
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,000
could root right next to it keeping

82
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,579
things very simple and get get success

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,259
right and that one mother plant if it's

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,719
in a little two by four little closet

85
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,239
area you should be able to get oh

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,639
probably a couple dozen clones off of

87
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,378
that on a really consistent basis and I

88
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,919
say clones where they're just all tops

89
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:43,079
and um grow uniform in the growth right

90
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,878
so uniform in the tray uniform and veg

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,519
uniform and flower so on and so forth

92
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,679
but a little two by four closet man you

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,200
could you know probably do 50 clones a

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,700
month off that space keeping it very

95
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,098
small but as long as you keep it simple

96
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,199
keep things uh as steady as you can

97
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,119
wherever you could maintain your

98
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,699
parameters as far as humidity and and

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,039
temperature this is I'd rather have

100
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,439
consistency and play with that than have

101
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,179
irregularities and unpredictability in

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,878
your room environment so keep it simple

103
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,860
keep it steady and you know you'll get

104
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,079
plenty of vegetative growth clone them

105
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,319
root them and you know share them with

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,239
friends [ __ ] yeah man I want to back it

107
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,159
up a little bit I want these guys to get

108
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,159
a little bit more familiar with you how

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,500
did you get into cannabis and how did

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,900
you go from that first experience with

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,939
cannabis to becoming a clone coach

112
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:34,739
oh it's been a journey

113
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,680
um I mean we're talking I'll be third I

114
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,639
just turned 34 so that is 16 years

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,160
without counting my minor years as a

116
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,259
journey right because you know as a

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,300
minor I I was consuming cannabis and

118
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,520
became an advocate for it I was I was

119
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,160
that guy in the family right you know

120
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,959
that that was me you know late teens

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,300
going into you know 18 I got my medical

122
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,638
card here in California and I've been a

123
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,160
patient ever since right I'm an advocate

124
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm a patient through and through and um

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,060
earlier on you know I didn't have the

126
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,560
ability to like there was no commercial

127
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,459
facilities that I was able to like work

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,160
at

129
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,918
but you know I had the desire to to

130
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,840
cultivate you know did the collective

131
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:20,039
thing cultivated that way and stuff here

132
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:23,819
and there but really grew that into when

133
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,740
2016 hit like 2015 hit I left my

134
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,319
corporate job because I just couldn't

135
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,900
ignore the desire to to cultivate and

136
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,259
and you know give my all to this plant

137
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,538
really and uh you know I made that a

138
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,080
switch you know I turned a spare bedroom

139
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:41,759
into a little nursery and I was well

140
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,620
back up one quick step I was trying to

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
you know Garden you know make a garden

142
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,939
you know Causeway a little room

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,500
but when it came time to get plants to

144
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,660
fill the room get clothes to fill the

145
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,839
Romans where I got stuck I couldn't find

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,180
a Dependable consistent source of good

147
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,179
clone so I could plant a crop that was

148
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,340
my first struggle so when I did my first

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,500
room I was able to finally Source

150
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,879
genetics and clones and instead of

151
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,399
flipping them to flower I said look I'm

152
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,879
just gonna fill that need because I had

153
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,739
that need and I you know took my first

154
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,300
tray of clones and turned a spare

155
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,360
bedroom and threw up a few lights and

156
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,860
and just was Off to the Races applying

157
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,379
um the medical dispensaries and medical

158
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,879
collectives out here in the area and

159
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,060
then 2018 hit

160
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,560
recreational came to California and I

161
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,079
started working at a recreational

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,879
facility huge licensed commercial grows

163
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,418
started popping up here in my backyard

164
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,819
so it's like I dove head into there

165
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,439
and I've done brokering with sales for

166
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,060
clones for different nurseries and stuff

167
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,478
but it's always been nurseries that's

168
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,860
clones nurseries mother plants that's

169
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,899
where I've maintained the focus

170
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,699
throughout the whole cultivation career

171
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,099
that I've had you know up until now and

172
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,139
uh just to quickly sum it up till now

173
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,660
you know I've always had a good desire

174
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,759
to help people and you know I was

175
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,680
turning around nurseries that I was you

176
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,780
know managing I'll take them from point

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,418
A to point B and point B was a lot

178
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,638
better than point a and you know turning

179
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,019
these nurseries around and I wanted to

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,918
help more nurseries than the one I was

181
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,418
just working at so

182
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,219
I started helping friends that were

183
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,379
remote you know I would send in some

184
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,940
info I'd hop on the phone I'd send them

185
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,978
emails I would you know do everything

186
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,259
kind of just just scattered around until

187
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:26,519
I finally kind of packaged it up and

188
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,319
said you know let's let's see if this

189
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,478
really helps people with this package

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,699
that created and it's it's been working

191
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,978
people all over the world are getting

192
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,680
results with this package with the

193
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:39,598
coaching call you know and now we're

194
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,180
really changing the standard of what we

195
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,538
accept as like viable clones like no

196
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,220
more little sick purple yellow little

197
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:49,500
baby clones that you need to spend

198
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,960
another two weeks to tenderly bring them

199
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,639
back to health

200
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,859
exactly so that's

201
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,860
that's a quick the quick journey of the

202
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,300
last you know 16 years you know playing

203
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,460
with this plant

204
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,079
that's awesome man yeah I'm glad you

205
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,579
brought up that point like I was saying

206
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,698
you know you have to have that healthy

207
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,399
Foundation right yep that's a big

208
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,080
problem that a lot of people have with

209
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,478
their clones is that wilting that

210
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:19,198
purpling the yellowing

211
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:23,219
um and more often than not I find that

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,680
that's due to either just watering the

213
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,479
[ __ ] out of them thinking that they need

214
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,579
water [ __ ] constantly to the point

215
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:33,418
where they don't get air

216
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,860
or uh just too high a humidity levels in

217
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:37,079
general without that air exchange

218
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,639
usually the coupling of those two is

219
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,320
where I see that

220
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,019
um what's been your experience with the

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,020
the yellowing the rotting tips

222
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,778
yeah I mean if that's happening in your

223
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:52,019
clones it's if you're getting rotting

224
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:54,299
fuzziness damping off mold things like

225
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,799
that you have excess humidity and it's a

226
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,359
very common problem it's like it's like

227
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,399
over Watering your your vegetative

228
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
plants or your flowering plants you

229
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,419
could have too much humidity in your

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,500
clone domes and your clones for too long

231
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:09,778
and that leads to problems so a huge tip

232
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,000
that I could give to people is just let

233
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:14,759
the plants breathe let them breathe

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,919
don't trap that humidity that stagnant

235
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,620
stale humid air

236
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,958
on these clones for days and days and

237
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,399
days on end if you just eliminated that

238
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,319
out of your process and you let these

239
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,720
clones breathe a bit more

240
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,760
you'll have you'll eliminate you know

241
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,200
good chunk of those problems we just

242
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,539
mentioned so

243
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,180
a very common thing is just like too

244
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,740
much humidity for too long that and if

245
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:41,099
you combine that with a little bit

246
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,919
cooler temperatures like in the low 70s

247
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,200
recipe for for disaster recipe for

248
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,958
issues recipe for extending your rooting

249
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,300
time recipe for all the above really

250
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,359
yeah I think you and I kind of came

251
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,219
around the same ERA with the HPS and CMH

252
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,080
kind of being like the new thing wow

253
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,200
these are pretty cool you know because

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,060
now there's LEDs LEDs are dominating the

255
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
[ __ ] Market well when it came to the

256
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,958
LED switch

257
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,240
um they're so efficient we're often

258
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,979
running lower power which results in

259
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,539
lower temperatures

260
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,860
um so that's something that should have

261
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,360
been brought up so I'm glad you

262
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,600
mentioned that

263
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,759
um our patreon member crawdaddy wants to

264
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,500
know what is the optimal Temp and

265
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:29,759
humidity I run mine like low 80s high

266
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:33,839
70s and I don't think I ever surpassed

267
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,759
like 70 on my RH what is those are your

268
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,380
parameters yeah if those are your

269
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,299
parameters that's that's spot on it's

270
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,278
real good advice if you could maintain a

271
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,019
steady environment shoot for 80 degrees

272
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,360
if you have to deal with a little bit of

273
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,278
a swing you know try to see what side of

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,659
the Swing is better for you right a

275
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,078
little bit warmer rather than a little

276
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:54,480
bit cooler right with humidity if you're

277
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,639
capped at 70 like that's a Max that your

278
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,519
room hits that's that's great you know

279
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,139
shoot for 65 60 you know you don't want

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,360
to be 40s and 50s because then it's

281
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,000
you're too dry and you're really going

282
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,560
to readjust your whole Dome protocol to

283
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,820
compensate for that lack of humidity

284
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,379
there

285
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,839
um but even if you're a little bit more

286
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,639
humid and you stay at 70. as long as

287
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,100
your room could breathe if you treat

288
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,519
your room like a dome like one big dome

289
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,620
and let that air exchange happen without

290
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,019
days and days and days of trapping that

291
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,078
humid stagnant air humidifiers pumping

292
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,820
and if you just let it breathe you'll be

293
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,219
able to you know deal with a little bit

294
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,860
more consistent higher humidity as well

295
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,500
good point what is some of your favorite

296
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,959
methods for cloning

297
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,299
um I I've had Growers that are I've

298
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,059
personally have used the hydro cloner

299
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,799
I've uh cloned directly into soil before

300
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,419
that's actually one of my favorite ways

301
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,578
just because for the home Growers it's

302
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,379
cheap easy and if you got your you know

303
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:54,838
you got everything in line it'll happen

304
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:58,259
for you with pretty good success rates

305
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,680
if I've done that I've done uh those the

306
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,139
root right and Rapid Rooter Keys I've

307
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,819
used uh the rock wool I wasn't crazy

308
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,159
about the rock wool but I wanted to know

309
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,140
a little bit about what your preferred

310
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,838
method is what are you seeing the best

311
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,019
success with obviously it's a little bit

312
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,079
different grower situation per situation

313
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,000
but the man himself let's hear let's

314
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,338
hear your little thing there obviously

315
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,220
you can't give us a secret sauce but

316
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,260
yeah I mean my favorite versus what's

317
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,759
the best are two different answers I

318
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,100
would I would probably say right off the

319
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,120
bat right I mean but you know my

320
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,500
favorite

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
I like

322
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,059
you know any like 50 you know clones per

323
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,019
tray that's that's a good solid number

324
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,359
for me

325
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,980
but in the tray mediums you know root

326
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,659
riots were good

327
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,860
um I mean you could always root in a

328
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,179
root Riot the only thing I don't like

329
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,180
it's like it's a little bit inconsistent

330
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,219
in the holes but yeah you'll get that

331
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:55,859
thing to root no problem right

332
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,420
um but the the insert trays as long as

333
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,759
there's a little bit of a gap between

334
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,219
the insert tray and the solid tray and

335
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,919
the bottom I really prefer that because

336
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,620
then you could really get these huge

337
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,360
noodles of roots hanging out in that

338
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,940
inch of space where it's just enough

339
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,940
humidity and moisture where those roots

340
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,440
can grow kind of waking it up untouched

341
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,380
yep and that's how you get those really

342
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,240
big like chunky you know squared out

343
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,278
roots of you know inchworth down the

344
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,959
cube so there's some Gap in there that's

345
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,720
my favorite because visually when you

346
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,239
lift that tray it's just noodles

347
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,480
everywhere you know good point with the

348
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,680
roots hanging down the secondary tray

349
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,320
um

350
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,778
how I like to do it if I'm gonna go that

351
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,139
route is the little Ridges at the bottom

352
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:44,759
of them I keep that like full to the top

353
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,740
with my nutrient water but I don't

354
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,240
really let it go above those higher

355
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,100
ridges

356
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,240
um just so the moisture is there but

357
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,759
it's not

358
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,720
they're not sitting in a pool of water

359
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:00,480
you know yeah and that probably gets

360
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,000
changed every day if not every other day

361
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,278
yeah every other day for human you know

362
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,078
life happens you know

363
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,820
um but yeah leaving a little bit of

364
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,338
nutrient solution at the bottom of the

365
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,278
tray I love doing that too

366
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,980
um I only have to you know usually do it

367
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,778
um in like the last third of the rooting

368
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,639
process right like at the very end of

369
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,019
the rooting process the last you know

370
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,180
three or four days of the rooting

371
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,459
process is where I'll potentially start

372
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,919
leaving nutrient solution for me

373
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,439
um yeah just start acclimating yeah yeah

374
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,179
and then if they're ready it's like

375
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,920
they're already switching the veg then

376
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,500
hell yeah I want to give them more nudes

377
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,120
more light do you know make them use

378
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,759
that that root system that I'm building

379
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,980
up so uh yeah man I love that trick and

380
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,720
that's really how you get those long

381
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,639
spaghetti noodles that are you know that

382
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,199
lift up and super long because they're

383
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,839
hanging out in a little bit of nutrient

384
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,838
solution so is there anything that we

385
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,980
can do to our mothers to kind of prep

386
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,839
them

387
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,839
for more successful clones

388
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,379
just make sure

389
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,320
she's healthy

390
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:10,078
that's it definitely that's number one

391
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,060
make sure that you know the plant is

392
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,500
vibrant enough that it's transparent

393
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,539
enough to where it's drinking the

394
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,339
nutrients on a consistent basis right

395
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,259
it's it's up taking that water it's not

396
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,420
become bogged down that root zone is

397
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,399
really healthy and active you have that

398
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,740
good balance of light to where it could

399
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,559
veg out enough and as long as she's

400
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,079
green and happy and praying and eager

401
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,599
for that next watering right like it's a

402
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:34,919
vibrant plant that's that's what you

403
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,540
should do it doesn't matter what

404
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,719
nutrient brand you use doesn't matter

405
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,458
what just a healthy plant do that follow

406
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,278
some simple recipes some simple

407
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,778
additives keep it real simple you know

408
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,639
and just make sure that plant is

409
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,039
thriving and that's how you really

410
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,919
prepare for a good cloning session it's

411
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:57,719
just having the healthiest plant you can

412
00:15:52,919 --> 00:16:01,259
and if you want like specifics I usually

413
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,839
allow two weeks of growth before a clone

414
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,860
so two weeks of uninterrupted growth and

415
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,540
then a clone if you're going to keep

416
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,120
vegging after that then you would need

417
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,620
to prune and time it to where like two

418
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,600
weeks before you're gonna clone is where

419
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,240
you just leave it untouched

420
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,159
let's go a little more detailed into the

421
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,379
actual clones themselves because I

422
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,559
believe I was looking at your stories a

423
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,958
little while back and it made me laugh

424
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,698
at the same time it made me really happy

425
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,000
for you when you did your experiment

426
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:30,958
with your shorties

427
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,440
in there

428
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,299
I was always taught take a healthy sized

429
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,820
clone the more nodes you have the more

430
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,620
auxins you're you have the more rooting

431
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,180
hormone you have

432
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,100
um so it's really cool to see you

433
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,099
getting these entire Flats of these

434
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,199
little tiny shorties and [ __ ] like that

435
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,300
and at the same time

436
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,979
I was watching that and retaining

437
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:56,698
something else that I had seen on your

438
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,399
page before that and it was that you

439
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:02,159
didn't use clonex you you weren't a fan

440
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,619
of clonex what root what rooting hormone

441
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,539
what rooting practice are you using

442
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,639
I I think you may have gotten that

443
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,519
mistake and I did do uh I do like

444
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,699
clonics gel uh okay I don't like the

445
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,379
clonic solution or you know oh okay I

446
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,600
don't need the clinic Solutions you know

447
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,880
for my soaking

448
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,539
yeah the mist or the solution but the

449
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,240
gel is what I you know do purple gel

450
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,740
yeah so that it is here oh and that's

451
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,140
what you were using in the ketchup

452
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,419
bottle awesome yeah by the way that's

453
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,140
the coolest [ __ ] hack I've ever seen

454
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:39,059
you know man those shorties and that

455
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,660
ketchup bottle Tech once again I was

456
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:44,700
managing a nursery right I was you know

457
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,700
from sales production the build out the

458
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,519
design the you know the the the plants

459
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,880
everything and uh you know the Shorties

460
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,319
came about from you know the healthy

461
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,880
plan is going to give off Roots no

462
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,859
matter what so the level of auxins and

463
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,059
stuff that you mentioned in my head as

464
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:01,678
long as that plant's healthy through and

465
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,259
through wherever I cut it it'll it'll

466
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,298
root it'll want to root it'll need to

467
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,980
root you know

468
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,139
um so those shorties came about from

469
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,120
like needing extra Revenue like hey how

470
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,259
can we you know juice things up in a

471
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,259
nursery he's like well we're throwing

472
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,900
away all of this material all these

473
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,000
nodes that we trim off these stems just

474
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,298
green waste right we're paying for that

475
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,579
to get picked up and you know from from

476
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,460
trash to cash with those shorties man it

477
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,099
was just and because the consistency is

478
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,840
there for these side nodes as well like

479
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,519
you'll find a little rhythm or pattern

480
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,740
on your canopy where like you'll have

481
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,960
this size shorties you'll have this size

482
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,259
okay maybe you don't plug these all of

483
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,019
them this size plug them up you know and

484
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:48,000
it was the same process and you know

485
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,700
those little shorties are

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,220
shoot man if they're healthy yeah

487
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,340
absolutely and I think that's a big part

488
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,200
of it I think me without knowing or

489
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:01,740
recognizing it I think that was a big

490
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,900
part of my lack of success with the

491
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,759
short clones was because I was usually

492
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,798
taking one's lower down on the plant

493
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,419
that just weren't as healthy as that

494
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,700
canopy they weren't getting as much

495
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,259
light they were really stubby you know

496
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,380
so kind of going in they were a little

497
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,119
bit subpart of my even canopy I was

498
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,039
known for doing like multiple tops

499
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,678
flattening things out so everything just

500
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,119
was kind of lackluster underneath and I

501
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,360
think that was kind of incriminating

502
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:30,178
before the get-go but that that leads

503
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,178
into a good question as well is uh the

504
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:36,538
location of your clones I believe that

505
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,538
you said you like to do tops yeah well

506
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,700
yes tops for the consistency and the

507
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,259
trays and the consistency that passes on

508
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,779
to the vegetative state and the

509
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,099
flowering room right and you know when

510
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,859
I've always managed my nurseries there's

511
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:51,839
always you know uh nurseries for sale

512
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,279
you know stock for sale so I was

513
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,899
providing other cultivators their stock

514
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,960
so I had to provide a consistent product

515
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,538
that was number one so that's you get

516
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,038
that with that uninterrupted growth at

517
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:03,798
an even you know starting with an even

518
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:06,419
flat canopy

519
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:09,359
uninterrupted growth for 14 days you'll

520
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,100
get all even clones from the same size

521
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,500
same amount of light that they got the

522
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:16,500
whole time so on and so forth

523
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,798
um that's where I like you know taking

524
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,298
Mom stock off that next like B or C

525
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,798
Level stuff that the canopy you're

526
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,240
leaving behind

527
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,099
um there's nodes there there's clones

528
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,440
there there's you know branches you

529
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,699
could cut and root but those are B and C

530
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,900
grade you know you're starting to play

531
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,259
with that so

532
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,538
you know you'll get at Max B or C grade

533
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,160
coming out you know

534
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:39,900
um so that's why to keep it at the top

535
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,460
you know the bottoms are just like if

536
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,179
you got to keep the genetic alive or

537
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,700
whatever but it's not um good practice I

538
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,740
guess I'm with you I'm with you on that

539
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,419
one yeah I didn't even ask you what are

540
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,740
you smoking over there

541
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,820
oh

542
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,679
um

543
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,678
I think this is a little melon OG

544
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,298
yeah what's your typical favorite kind

545
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,880
of flower like what kind of you into the

546
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,798
fruity stuff the sours the hazes

547
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,660
oh you know if I could still get good

548
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,980
Haze like some super super Haze or

549
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,558
something I used to get back in the day

550
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,259
man I would you know I'd bless that

551
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,178
person yeah

552
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:20,339
I like yeah dude I like

553
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,679
I like stuff that keeps me working you

554
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,119
know I'm a smoker and a worker you know

555
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,240
that's I kind of get in the zone and

556
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,798
just you know get get in my you know

557
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,000
just like put like like a Ryder puffing

558
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,619
cigarettes and drinking coffee or

559
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,759
something you know I'm [ __ ] puffing

560
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,199
joints

561
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,658
um so anything that keeps me like

562
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,700
creative you know um kind of sharp and

563
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,020
then the complete opposite as well you

564
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,058
know something that's just like behind

565
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,158
the eyes

566
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:45,839
you know just brings you down and you're

567
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,960
just like all right time to relax you

568
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,959
know

569
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:55,979
is those two spectrums you know I'm a

570
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,658
good flower on top of anything as long

571
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,179
as it's burning good smoking good

572
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,440
tasting good then that's what I'm more

573
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,179
concerned about then I could kind of

574
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,558
pick and choose from there really you

575
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,700
know

576
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,678
so with what I do I'm more knf specific

577
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,480
we've got Growers all around the world

578
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,179
that are doing synthetic that are doing

579
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,620
organic they're doing commercial and

580
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,720
home grow

581
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:21,418
um so on the home growth scale I do more

582
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,759
of like a no-till on K F Type style

583
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:26,880
practice so we're usually using organic

584
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,240
natural products and I really like using

585
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,000
aloe and kelp to help promote my clones

586
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,700
do you do anything like that

587
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,279
well I'm like a True Believer in both of

588
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,259
those things right and so the journey is

589
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,599
you know finding the best quality and

590
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,658
the best source and the best producer of

591
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,980
those active ingredients that so yeah

592
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,659
100

593
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,480
um I want to do more experiments with

594
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,679
Organic cloning you know

595
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,538
um with

596
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,538
with like a full organic line you know

597
00:22:54,538 --> 00:23:00,000
I've I've rooted in like loose cocoa

598
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:02,158
right that's pre-charged with nutrients

599
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,720
so some people that have reached out to

600
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,159
me like hey you know they're organic

601
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,380
Growers and like how do you suggest I do

602
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,380
it right I can't just mix up you know

603
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:14,159
some liquid nutrients and put that into

604
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,900
you know my cubes and stuff so I've just

605
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,700
suggested them to try like yeah we'll

606
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,440
get the same kind of soil that's still

607
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,538
active that the plant came from it's

608
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,759
getting the same food that is a real

609
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,798
theory behind it gets the same food so

610
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,419
as it Roots it'll root right into the

611
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:29,519
same food so all we gotta do is initiate

612
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,100
rooting the aloe and the temperature and

613
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,000
stuff and humidity and then once it hits

614
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,859
that

615
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,740
if it was already feeding that and it

616
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:39,658
wasn't too much and it was happy then

617
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,120
that moist media and that excess

618
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,100
humidity and The Roots striking should

619
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,959
keep the momentum at the same pace is

620
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:48,178
that what do you what do you think about

621
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,400
like using the same soil that you know

622
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:54,360
it's already that's what I do typically

623
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,460
yeah yeah uh I use those roots I the

624
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,639
first time I ever attempted clothing I

625
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,860
did rock wool and I was I never I've

626
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,020
never done a synthetic I've done

627
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,119
synganic nutrients but I've never done

628
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,980
any synthetic growing is that just like

629
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,959
bottled organic stuff

630
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,779
yeah it was I think it was like an

631
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,720
eight-part system from Roots Organics it

632
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,819
was too many [ __ ] balls to be be

633
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,519
doing that was the old Norm it's not in

634
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,619
the norm anymore you know you know

635
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,759
Secrets out I mean fifty percent of the

636
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:25,759
secrets now you know

637
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:33,840
no more and then uh after that I'd move

638
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,519
to the root riots or rapid rooters kind

639
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,199
of those interchange I believe but I had

640
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,839
the same problem that you mentioned I

641
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,538
was really I got irritated about the

642
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,220
inconsistency of the holes on one you'd

643
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,720
have one that was a perfect size maybe

644
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,460
even five in a row and then you'd have

645
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,259
one that was barely in there and then

646
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,419
you try to open it up and you just rip

647
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,400
the cube and it's just it's not pliable

648
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,038
enough to where you could pierce it with

649
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,960
the stem right right so much resistance

650
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,819
and like you couldn't just Pierce a new

651
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,640
hole like you could even with rock wool

652
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,839
you could make a new one you know eighty

653
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,980
percent of the time with Rockwell seven

654
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,899
percent of the time because there are

655
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,819
those little hard spots you know that

656
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,019
you hit every now and again

657
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:16,558
so there was this point where we were

658
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:19,740
I want to say this was early 2010s we

659
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:23,460
were getting really in heavy with

660
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,339
hunting Thai land races and one of the

661
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,058
Thai land races or there's a certain

662
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:32,220
region about that Burma Myanmar border

663
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:33,720
where they have a certain type of plant

664
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,179
that they call a creeper and the

665
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,980
humidity is so high there that the lower

666
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,080
branches will actually touch the ground

667
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,480
they'll start rooting to the ground

668
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,038
and then they'll just keep going on you

669
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,599
can cut them right there disconnect them

670
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,278
and they're their own clone you know

671
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,599
just naturally like that but if you

672
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,778
don't that was like them you'll just

673
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,240
become a stronger base of the plant

674
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:56,278
exactly and I'm just like so if they can

675
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,440
do this in nature if they've got enough

676
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,659
rooting hormone because they are healthy

677
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,620
outdoor plants that get whatever they

678
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:08,400
need in this humid humic environment

679
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:10,918
um why can't I do the same thing so I

680
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,659
basically took the exact same practices

681
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,059
which it sounds like you and I kind of

682
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,100
cloned similar you know within similar

683
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:20,359
conditions and everything

684
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:24,599
um I was utilizing the same practice but

685
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:26,579
I started using my soil instead and it

686
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,199
started off using like Solo cups and

687
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:30,960
then I put a little hole in there you

688
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,580
know same same idea

689
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
um

690
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:35,399
pre-moistening all my medium before

691
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,600
doing it

692
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
um and then I would just take like a

693
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,199
Ziploc bag or something and put it over

694
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,419
the top and tape it on you know as a

695
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,400
humidity Dome after a couple days I

696
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,440
would cut one corner of the bag a couple

697
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,480
days later I cut the other corner of the

698
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,980
bag and just you know increase that

699
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,778
airflow and I was getting 100 success

700
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,419
and I wasn't having problems and I was

701
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:58,619
like what the hell I had a couple that

702
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,240
died

703
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,519
um and they had like that dampening off

704
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,319
around the end there you know Roots

705
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,819
rotting whatever

706
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,558
um so I was like well we got to open up

707
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,079
a little bit more airflow on the root

708
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,480
zone so it started off with just mixing

709
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,158
some more rice holes in with it

710
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,319
um and aerating it more it doesn't need

711
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,419
as much nutrition at that point but it

712
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,579
does need nutrition

713
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,759
um so I added some more rifles and I got

714
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:26,038
a little bit better better uh process

715
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,319
with that one and then what I ended up

716
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,960
my favorite thing to do is take like a

717
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,519
little small soil blocker same thing add

718
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,380
a little bit more rice hole so there's

719
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,940
more aeration but then I'll take a soil

720
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,059
blocker which is like a little have you

721
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,798
seen one soil blocker no yeah it's

722
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,558
called the soil Block it's a little tool

723
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,900
where you can reach into your your soil

724
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,000
there it's like this size of a square

725
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,220
tube you can get like a one by one or a

726
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,419
two by two square they'll do four at a

727
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,100
time and then you just clench it

728
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,059
together and it'll pack that soil

729
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:59,399
together in a square almost like a rock

730
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,778
wool Cube like that type of size and

731
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,480
then you just put a little hole in it

732
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:05,159
boom go I have seen that I have seen

733
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,720
that a commercial Nursery Productions

734
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,240
have that it's a tool have a loose bed

735
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,038
of soil just boom scoop it pack it boom

736
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,659
there's a you know 12 by 12 or whatever

737
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:17,640
comes out of whatever yeah and then soak

738
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,200
it the same way you know and keep The

739
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Ridges at the bottom with a little bit

740
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,860
of moisture in them I do great with

741
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,919
those well look man when it comes to

742
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:28,259
cloning all we're doing is initiating

743
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,299
rooting right the plant's going to want

744
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:33,179
to root it has hormones in it that tell

745
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:35,940
it to root you you supplement those same

746
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,340
hormones to encourage rooting you

747
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,778
initiate the rooting process and once

748
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,459
you start rooting

749
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:43,919
you're switching right back into the

750
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,840
vegetative process so it's just right

751
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,240
back to where it was before just growing

752
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,220
in a veg you know that's that's it you

753
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,099
know a week of rooting a week of veg

754
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,140
plan is ready clone is ready if you just

755
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,519
you know take it a step back and like

756
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,100
how you did it you know fairly

757
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,679
rudimentary with the Ziploc you know but

758
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:03,119
you you were accomplishing that and you

759
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,220
got success right the plant's going to

760
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,278
want to do those not going to take those

761
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,600
steps naturally you know so yeah man

762
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,179
it's it's

763
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,819
I I'm glad we're on the same page there

764
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,259
with like just using the same medium of

765
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:20,398
the plants that the mother the mother

766
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:24,599
plants in in organic situation right

767
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:26,219
yep and uh I haven't used I did use the

768
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,219
clonex

769
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,399
in the rock wool I use them in the and

770
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,919
in the rapid rooters as well but when I

771
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,199
started moving to my soil

772
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,538
um I wanted I just kind of I'm a little

773
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,298
bit of a hippie and I wanted to get it

774
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:44,038
as organic as possible so I started uh

775
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,079
taking something that gas told me and

776
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:48,839
that was taking fillets off my aloe

777
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,119
plant and uh dipping them dipping my

778
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:53,038
clone straight into that aloe

779
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,979
um

780
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,500
yeah right same thing or doing a full

781
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,259
years with kelp and root drenches with

782
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,140
kelp and things like this I I was under

783
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:06,419
the impression that you ran

784
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,799
um heavy synthetic nutrients in most of

785
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,860
your growth

786
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:13,379
as a base nutrient I do I do run the

787
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:16,859
base mpk with just you know a simple

788
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,500
two-part you know synthetic nutrient but

789
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:21,959
the bigger piece of a healthy plant are

790
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,119
all the bio stimulants and nine times

791
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,058
out of ten they're organic biostimulants

792
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,158
like that is what makes a really healthy

793
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:32,099
plant you know for me like it's it's

794
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,960
always been like you know cocoa and

795
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,418
um you know bottled based nutrients and

796
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,179
then organic biostimulants and that

797
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:41,700
right environment Right light that gets

798
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,399
me a healthy happy plant you know

799
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,899
um so I mean but I'm right there with

800
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,959
you man it's like it's

801
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:52,099
if you could have the organic covering

802
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,720
your bases then bio Simmons don't change

803
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:56,339
right if you got your mpk covered the

804
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,558
biostimulants don't change the plant

805
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,379
wants all those natural healthy things

806
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:04,678
how do you feel about the use of micro

807
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,120
binoculations with with Hydro synthetic

808
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,460
growth

809
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,658
it's one thing that I say I won't grow

810
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,600
without

811
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:16,320
really wow so how do you feel about the

812
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,699
people that uh say that the salt-based

813
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,439
synthetic nutrients are killing off

814
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,980
these microbes

815
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,640
that's not what salt nutrients do

816
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,980
right microbes and beneficial fungi and

817
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,200
beneficial bacteria that are active in

818
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,839
your root Zone could only get killed by

819
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,120
a fungicide or uh you know something

820
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,038
like that that kills fungus and bacteria

821
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,898
that's what kills it whether that's a

822
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:41,879
chemical fungicide

823
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,639
um is usually the case right where that

824
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,100
will kill off your microbes but

825
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,860
salt-based nutrients are just providing

826
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,538
exactly what's in them right the

827
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:54,658
nitrogen phosphorus potassium copper

828
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:56,700
sulfur you know all the micronutrients

829
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:59,039
um as a base and that's the mpk value

830
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,659
but you know it's not a fungicide you

831
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,240
know in its chemical nature so it won't

832
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:05,580
kill off any beneficial fungi

833
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,278
cool very cool

834
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:09,480
um yeah that's something I've always

835
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:13,099
appreciated being able to talk about

836
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,380
because I'm nor I'm not one of those

837
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:18,480
no-till guys it's like oh man Organics

838
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,399
all the way you're the devil if you I've

839
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,899
got Growers all around the world that do

840
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,418
every kind of growing and I ask

841
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:27,479
personally out of curiosity because I

842
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,860
have not got to grow in that way uh I

843
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,360
haven't grown in your way with the with

844
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,979
the other way so like I'm curious too

845
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:34,859
man because this plant's an amazing

846
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,919
thing right like so the inputs that it

847
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:39,418
receives that we provided like dads what

848
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,038
drives a curiosity we're like because

849
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,399
that drives different results and you

850
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,859
know for me like a healthy plan is

851
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,538
undeniable like I don't have to tell you

852
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,158
I can just show you and you just see it

853
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:53,339
and the plant will tell you that it's

854
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,980
[ __ ] oh yeah you know so healthy is

855
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:58,980
is healthy healthy is undeniable

856
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,200
absolutely I think I had my biggest

857
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,940
wake-up call

858
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,980
um back in the days when we had to hide

859
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,100
our growing [ __ ] like that and it was at

860
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,599
a local nursery and I was still in the

861
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,658
soil building at that time I was doing

862
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:15,178
super soils and pre-mixing everything

863
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:17,159
and uh I was I was looking at some

864
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,899
amendments and the guy from the store

865
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,880
comes up to me goes what can I help you

866
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,199
with and he goes I don't remember what

867
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,240
it was at this time but he started

868
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,340
pointing out a synthetic nutrient I was

869
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,558
like oh no I don't I don't use anything

870
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:30,178
like that I'm really Strictly Organic

871
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,339
and everything he goes

872
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,190
well everything on this Earth comes from

873
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:36,480
something

874
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,880
[Laughter]

875
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,440
like that you guys will sell all these

876
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,340
salt-based nutrients are made out of

877
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,620
organic inputs yeah just raw real raw

878
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,119
organic

879
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:50,278
they might be lab created but they're

880
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,538
created from something that was of this

881
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,519
Earth

882
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:55,500
just opened my eyes where I was like wow

883
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,359
yeah you got a point there man you're

884
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,220
right you are right

885
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,479
those are just elements right you know

886
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,038
there's elements of nutrients like

887
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,720
that's what we're going after right

888
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,579
where we need the same thing we need to

889
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,159
say minerals like

890
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,539
that's that's that's funny man I I'm

891
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,000
gonna borrow that I'm gonna use that if

892
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:14,219
I can remember it yeah

893
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,440
something else that I saw that you had

894
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,299
suggested earlier

895
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,760
um really intrigued me because I've

896
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,300
never not done it do you you don't

897
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,720
scrape your clones you don't split the

898
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,720
stems

899
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,559
I don't I I don't but

900
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,418
I have and I've definitely done it but

901
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,280
for me it's always been you know helping

902
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,098
others and managing Crews and teams to

903
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,659
to execute certain steps and get certain

904
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,580
consistency out of the out of the

905
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,679
production of the nursery stock you know

906
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:51,000
so I wouldn't implement it because

907
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,280
everybody's scrape is a little bit

908
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,079
different the tissue is different on the

909
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,639
Clone so how many layers how deep those

910
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,559
layers are

911
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,000
um you know those those slices become

912
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,799
very inconsistent

913
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,619
and um

914
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,300
you don't need them to make Roots you

915
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,700
know clean simple cut in the right

916
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,680
environment you'll strike roots from the

917
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,799
whole inch the bottom inch of the stem

918
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,319
right like you you also don't you don't

919
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,539
need it to gain the success is it bad

920
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,700
will it hurt you no no it won't if you

921
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:22,380
could do it and you could you know keep

922
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:25,559
everything as consistent as you can with

923
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,140
your slices and cuts and scrapes then

924
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,779
um yeah there's really no harm in it

925
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:34,078
it's just for like scaling up and

926
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,880
managing people then I like to avoid it

927
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,880
you know at that level

928
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,160
what do you use to uh cut your clones

929
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,539
and what do you use to sterilize those

930
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,239
tools

931
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:47,579
I used to use razor blades single-sided

932
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,459
razor blades

933
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:53,160
um then chica Masa scissors were always

934
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,480
classic clean cut you know made a clean

935
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,819
cut

936
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,920
um that's the cut the stock off of the

937
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,280
mother plants and then I'd always use

938
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,639
either razor blade or scalpel to do the

939
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,920
final slice where I'm measuring the

940
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:10,019
Clone on them on a measuring mat cutting

941
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,119
mat cutting board so make them all the

942
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:13,980
same size make the 45 degree cut all the

943
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,680
same size of the stem

944
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,260
uh that's usually with the scalpel

945
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,059
um and then Yemen you know 10 bleach is

946
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,160
always gonna work it's always going to

947
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:24,299
work as far as disinfection

948
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,819
um and it's and it's usually always

949
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,760
handy and the cheapest option so

950
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,380
clean not RO water I wouldn't say mix RO

951
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,140
water with the Bleach you know just get

952
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,720
some filter tap water or Ro that's

953
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:38,940
topped off with some tap water

954
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,219
um and make your 10 bleach solution to

955
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,139
dip your tools and your blades in you

956
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:46,679
know that'll get you as much protection

957
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:50,098
you know as you could could desire our

958
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:53,399
uh patreon member twist says

959
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,200
any tips on taking clones after flower I

960
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,059
recently took five clones from a

961
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,299
flowering plant and I'm wondering if I

962
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:03,299
should be doing anything special

963
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,460
so I have not so much experience with

964
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,519
this first hand a lot of experience with

965
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,280
the second hand and I've seen a lot of

966
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,259
people just you know get success with it

967
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,660
right you know that plant at a certain

968
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,119
stage kind of depends on when in flower

969
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:21,838
because I've seen stuff like before

970
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,180
Harvest get cloned and you'll they're

971
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,858
obviously more sensitive to humidity so

972
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,199
you know that that nug and that moisture

973
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:30,179
is already made up of you know 70 80

974
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,059
moisture

975
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:35,639
um so just anything special watch that

976
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:37,078
moisture you know on that foliage on

977
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:39,179
those buds

978
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,500
um and just treat it the same treat the

979
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,480
roots the same you know we're shooting

980
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,659
strike roots and encourage rooting and

981
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,579
then take it right back to you know this

982
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:50,399
vegetative growth

983
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,940
I wouldn't say it's ideal to go to a

984
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,940
re-vege it's definitely

985
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,500
I do it quite often with my female hunts

986
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,599
just because it's a little bit faster

987
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,480
and easier for me to find that genetic

988
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,400
that I like and go back to it

989
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,079
um which brings me into something else I

990
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,700
wanted to ask you

991
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,180
which might be a little bit different

992
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:14,939
for wreck in commercial I'm not 100 sure

993
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:17,899
but how do you feel about seed mothers

994
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,519
versus clone mothers

995
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,980
I would prefer them if you have the

996
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,139
ability to choose the right

997
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,619
um plant to make mother stock from

998
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,598
that's from seed right A Mother's mother

999
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,820
stock whether it's from Cedar clone it

1000
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,039
should be a proven genetic should be

1001
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,960
something that's proven trustworthy you

1002
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,300
know what to expect that's why you want

1003
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,920
to duplicate it over and over again you

1004
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,140
know but if you have the ability to get

1005
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,980
seed stock and choose your mother from

1006
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:45,960
that

1007
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,000
you always get oh man there's nothing

1008
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,440
like a seed right a real healthy seed is

1009
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
going to be super vigorous you give it

1010
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,639
all the inputs just you'll probably get

1011
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,039
some drastic size looking fan leaves

1012
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:59,098
just a plant that's just crazy thriving

1013
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,779
right so 100 if you could do seeds and

1014
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,980
find that right one you want to make a

1015
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,140
mother out of

1016
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,719
yeah it's the way to go is there any

1017
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,118
difference between the time that you

1018
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,659
would keep a seed mother around in the

1019
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,119
time you take keep a clone mother around

1020
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:17,578
no but I guess the seed mother would

1021
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,700
have more of a longer life just because

1022
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,440
of the early stage of the seedling and

1023
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:24,779
then slow cooking and stuff so that

1024
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,440
extra time that gets added

1025
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,760
um

1026
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
you know would probably be the only

1027
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,020
difference

1028
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,480
okay so you're not seeing any any

1029
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:36,480
weakening in the genetics uh going on

1030
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,960
from a seed mother to a clone duplicate

1031
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,619
mother of that seed mother no

1032
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,139
um

1033
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,820
unproven healthy genetics you know one

1034
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:46,858
or two generations or even a handful of

1035
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,480
generations down if you keep that plant

1036
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:49,980
in a healthy State you know free from

1037
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,358
pests and disease and just gives it all

1038
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,460
the give it all the inputs that it needs

1039
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,519
you have a healthy plant you know I see

1040
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,300
very few cases of that genetic drift you

1041
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,460
know

1042
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,900
um you know in that sense and the plants

1043
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,639
are getting older and like oh it's old

1044
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,599
mom stock genetic drift you know it's

1045
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,000
like well

1046
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,859
a plant that you know is going to live

1047
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,358
for a very long time shouldn't get the

1048
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:11,159
same recipe as a plant that's going to

1049
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,319
live for a short amount of time you have

1050
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:15,179
to you have to look at the whole picture

1051
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,619
right so it's usually

1052
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,639
the plant you could keep a healthy plant

1053
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,880
going

1054
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,920
for six months nine months like you can

1055
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,358
you just have to do a lot of things to

1056
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,880
make sure it's really healthy and free

1057
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,880
from yeah disease for that period of

1058
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,559
time you know that's awesome man yeah we

1059
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,380
used to do that for

1060
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:37,380
uh our outdoor season we started running

1061
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,019
these big old greenhouses outside and I

1062
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,519
was like man this is not indoor growing

1063
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:43,440
anymore you know we've got to kind of

1064
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,358
change our headspace up we need more veg

1065
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,639
if we're gonna wind up with these

1066
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,858
gigantic ass plants you know yeah yeah

1067
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,440
so we would [ __ ] there was a couple

1068
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:55,559
cultivars that were really really slow

1069
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,320
growing and to get a nice proper Bush

1070
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,659
and the other thing is going from an

1071
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,640
indoor environment when you're growing

1072
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,379
over the winter

1073
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,239
um you know and getting a nice healthy

1074
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,980
one before that spring and bringing it

1075
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,979
out there you already got something big

1076
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,139
that acclimates a lot faster than you

1077
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,940
know like a little tiny clone wood that

1078
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,799
was already used to an indoor

1079
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,039
environment so we'd Bush these things

1080
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,720
out for like six months indoor you know

1081
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,279
we just get these huge ones that were

1082
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,379
about to touch the light and then just

1083
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,500
move them outdoor and wind up with like

1084
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,838
14 foot plants it was so much fun but it

1085
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,400
is a pain in the ass oh my God yeah it

1086
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:34,799
is a pain in the ass and then you got

1087
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,260
all that defoliation that trimming and

1088
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,599
just trying to keep that shape oh but

1089
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,260
see there was one in specific that's

1090
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,119
coming to mind we had a femme of uh and

1091
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,800
I don't grow very many Femmes but we did

1092
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,539
have one that we liked and it was called

1093
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,440
blueberry cheesecake

1094
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:54,779
and it was such a finicky genetic

1095
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,659
if you grew it outdoor in all natural

1096
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,820
sun it's completely fine would give you

1097
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,159
amazing yields it would grow like a tie

1098
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,559
it'd be really really tall you grew that

1099
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,960
same thing indoor under synthetic or

1100
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,119
unnatural lighting and it would throw a

1101
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,519
nanner or two every single time

1102
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,740
yeah yeah it was like we were keeping it

1103
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,239
over winter just to grow it outdoor

1104
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,939
yeah

1105
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,858
I mean genetic is is different in that

1106
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,358
sense and like where it grows and how it

1107
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:23,039
grows and the inputs that it receives

1108
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,858
and what it likes and what it can thrive

1109
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,779
in is really unique to each genetic you

1110
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:29,699
know like they're bred in certain ways

1111
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,880
bread from certain lineage you know like

1112
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:35,699
there's there's real to that you know

1113
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,400
these environments guys I know a lot of

1114
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:40,139
you have to grow you know your veg with

1115
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,539
your clones or

1116
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:46,078
um mix it up like that but if you can

1117
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:49,079
spare the time uh to make your own clone

1118
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,420
room they definitely have their own uh

1119
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,280
conditions that they grow in

1120
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,338
um and to be able to control that

1121
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,339
environment a little bit more what

1122
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,019
light schedule do you prefer to use for

1123
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:03,179
your clones because I know a lot of

1124
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:05,639
these guys are using are doing the same

1125
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,679
thing like I said growing veg and their

1126
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,838
clones in the same room

1127
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,199
um so they're probably running 18 6

1128
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,759
maybe 24. what what light schedule do

1129
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,578
you like to use

1130
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,319
for for clones I like 24 hours man for

1131
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,539
clones like 24 hours I like I like

1132
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:23,759
consistency that I could kind of predict

1133
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:25,139
you know that that stable environment in

1134
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,720
my in my you know little micro

1135
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:28,440
environment with the Clones you know

1136
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,039
um

1137
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,780
and if I have 18 6 going on nearby

1138
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,759
I'm not worried about

1139
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,079
um that little bit of light Interruption

1140
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,760
you know because you're you're still in

1141
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,380
a vegetative state you know the plants

1142
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,720
are still asleep right a little bit of

1143
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,579
you know lighting is not gonna you know

1144
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,779
Make It Stop vegging or make it veg more

1145
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,260
like what's gonna happen is there's a

1146
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,780
veg more like yeah

1147
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:54,480
so uh I'm not scared of a little bit of

1148
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,180
you know over lighting you know like a

1149
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,740
little overlap you know indirect yeah

1150
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:00,838
direct no it's a different story you

1151
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:03,239
know that's just lighting you know but

1152
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,400
uh yeah with the Clones 24 hours you

1153
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,618
know keep this thing is nice and stable

1154
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,900
and you said you were using kelp as well

1155
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,880
how do you like to use kelp do you use

1156
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:16,260
it as a root drench or do you use it a

1157
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:19,980
foliar or both both babies both oh yeah

1158
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:23,099
how do you schedule your your kelp feed

1159
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,400
to the time that you take clones

1160
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:29,160
oh it's a good question so

1161
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,619
they get kelp on day one of Clone as

1162
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:33,719
well so I kind of just reverse you know

1163
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,000
go back from there you know and and have

1164
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,578
my weekly root drench you know planned

1165
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,079
out of you know about a week before that

1166
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,160
um you know kind of based on what I'm

1167
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,220
gonna clone because it's gonna get

1168
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:45,118
another treatment then right so

1169
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,639
um

1170
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,858
yeah that's I kind of just take it back

1171
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:52,500
you know about a week before and okay

1172
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:55,500
give us some Cup in The Roots cup in the

1173
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,619
in the foliar I do like a little sooner

1174
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:01,559
like the the day before or you know

1175
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:04,079
within you know a day or two before

1176
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,420
um cloning I like to do a little uh full

1177
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,119
foliar spray with the kelp oh yeah

1178
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,260
getting those natural plant Regulators

1179
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,880
in there

1180
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,980
um to get those roots shooting now

1181
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,460
before you get them taken that's awesome

1182
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,079
man have you cut is there any uh any

1183
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,639
types that you've come across that

1184
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,318
you're just like you walk into a room

1185
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,879
they're like all right clone coach we're

1186
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,880
doing this today and you're like [ __ ]

1187
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,780
well you haven't worked in a license

1188
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,280
industry and I haven't that's why I'm

1189
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,400
asking

1190
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:38,040
well look man it's there

1191
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,119
the the license regulated industry the

1192
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,739
companies that are popping up this

1193
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,240
cultivation sites in my experience at

1194
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,858
least you know I can only speak on you

1195
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,899
know what I've experienced you know if

1196
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:47,119
I'm 2018 of working at different spots

1197
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,460
there

1198
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,619
there's startups that are like kind of

1199
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,380
micro corporate right they're like

1200
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,400
corporate startups but funding from you

1201
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,318
know all over the place because they're

1202
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,539
just startups right and startup

1203
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,279
operators and stuff and then the state

1204
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,779
and all the extra regulation and just

1205
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,760
all this stuff like it's

1206
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,140
yeah man if you're asking if ever have I

1207
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,520
ever walked into a room and said [ __ ]

1208
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,358
after hearing some news yeah man it's

1209
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,358
happened once or twice

1210
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,160
that you've come across that are like

1211
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,500
harder to clone than anything else

1212
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,059
there's some harder ones

1213
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,440
um there's just some uglier ones you

1214
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:27,059
know just things that just don't veg

1215
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,800
nice but

1216
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:31,380
you know and don't give off a lot of

1217
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,960
clones in a mother plan or anything like

1218
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,358
that but they uh you know had popular

1219
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,858
flower you know so

1220
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,019
but yeah there's some stuff that this

1221
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:41,279
doesn't veg very well

1222
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:44,420
um what's been some of your favorite

1223
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,420
genetics to work with

1224
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,920
I guess I start off with the first

1225
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:52,739
genetic that I worked with you know uh

1226
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,200
which was Wonder Woman from Nirvana

1227
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:58,199
seeds that I ordered in high school

1228
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:01,679
hadn't stored in a drawer and had a

1229
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:04,500
brother a friend of mine

1230
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,480
um need them provided the seeds and then

1231
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,940
when I was when I quit my job to start

1232
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,940
cloning those are the first clones that

1233
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,800
I ever took was from those that genetic

1234
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,720
that they had going we had a little

1235
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,060
bathroom of it went into the bathroom

1236
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,939
got a couple mother plants took my first

1237
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,019
like 30 40 clones of this Wonder Woman

1238
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,659
strain

1239
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:27,000
and started my Nursery there man like

1240
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:28,858
that was full circle with those you know

1241
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,980
seeds that I bought online you know as a

1242
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:34,679
kid you know in my teens

1243
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,780
what lights were you using back then

1244
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:40,078
metal highlights metal highlights were

1245
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,180
like the middle highlights yeah that

1246
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,460
that I kind of just stuck with early on

1247
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,940
in the early days

1248
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:52,679
and now you prefer the CMH silly

1249
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:56,000
I do I do yeah I mean the plants do so

1250
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,000
you know I listen to them

1251
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,380
do you have some do I hear some

1252
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:04,260
resentment to the LEDs

1253
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,780
I hate having to adjust everything to

1254
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,000
accommodate for these LEDs

1255
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,760
that's just me

1256
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,679
um and still I'm still

1257
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,079
you know not get

1258
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,639
I don't know yeah they're still they're

1259
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,260
still not a resentment man you know

1260
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:21,719
there's I've definitely vegged some

1261
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,460
solid mom stock and veg stock underneath

1262
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:25,139
LEDs but it you're playing a different

1263
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,280
game and you you really are adjusting

1264
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:28,858
everything else and they're usually

1265
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,960
higher inputs not lower inputs you know

1266
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:34,578
for those lower light LED lower wattage

1267
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,500
but then you know uh yeah

1268
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:38,460
the efficacy they require a little bit

1269
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,858
more

1270
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,260
right yeah because I mean for me to get

1271
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:46,199
the same result in my plant you have to

1272
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:49,619
give it a bunch more right if I under

1273
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:52,500
CMH I could have very healthy very solid

1274
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:55,140
green solid green and from from top to

1275
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,719
bottom solid green plants

1276
00:48:55,139 --> 00:49:00,480
um healthy like you know the low twos in

1277
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,118
the EC right low low to mid twos in the

1278
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,500
EC healthy bio stimulants and light and

1279
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,019
stuff like that

1280
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,699
um but with LED like I would get purple

1281
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:12,358
that's where I'd get purple stems purple

1282
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:15,899
striping so I have to adjust base adjust

1283
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:17,039
uptake adjust you know yeah that start

1284
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,700
adjusting

1285
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:23,338
um and for veg specifically

1286
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:25,259
I don't you know

1287
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:26,940
the the wattage is not that big of a

1288
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,460
difference like I don't need a lot of

1289
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:32,159
wattage and veg anyways so for flour

1290
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,380
maybe it's a different story you know

1291
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:37,019
um but you know that's not my reality

1292
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,660
I'm with you yeah but for veg man you

1293
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:41,579
don't need much I mean you less than a

1294
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:43,980
thousand Watts over four by you know

1295
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:46,019
over 32 square foot you know full by you

1296
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,119
know tray you know you got a thousand

1297
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:51,539
Watts on that you get get a thousand

1298
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:54,420
clones a month man you know no problem

1299
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:57,179
good point good boy yes I switched over

1300
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,760
to all those LEDs but uh honestly I

1301
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:01,799
still prefer and I wanted to ask you

1302
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,079
about this as well to see if it lines up

1303
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,839
if you're in a situation where you're

1304
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,440
doing clones on racks and you need that

1305
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:13,619
low profile lighting

1306
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,858
would you still go LED strips or would

1307
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:18,900
you go with the T5 how high output or

1308
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:22,019
something else

1309
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,460
for that for that vertical racking you

1310
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,400
know you can't go see a mage because I

1311
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,720
tried that and you're like 16 inches you

1312
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,000
know with an LED light you could

1313
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,039
probably be at four inches

1314
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,079
um

1315
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,900
T5 I never really liked I never really

1316
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,400
liked using t5s and never needed to

1317
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,480
because I was using the other lights and

1318
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,338
stuff so

1319
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,838
I just don't like them because I've just

1320
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,639
never never used them enough to really

1321
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:46,980
like them you know

1322
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,659
um but yeah man I'd go LED I mean I'm

1323
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,818
I'm playing with them too I got you know

1324
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:53,159
some LEDs in the closet right now like

1325
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:54,420
it's oh so you're still doing home grow

1326
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,879
as well

1327
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,440
you know it it comes and goes

1328
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,838
um you know whenever whenever I'm able

1329
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,280
to but yeah you know I'm a patient first

1330
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:07,619
so but I am kind of re

1331
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:11,280
regrouping that room to make it more

1332
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:12,838
value based for like you know trials and

1333
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,540
research and stuff for you know the

1334
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:16,980
channel for clone coach and stuff so

1335
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,079
um you know gonna give it a little bit

1336
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,059
more effort so it's on pause for now

1337
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,400
