berries it's from a 209 Stone City

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,560
genetics and I went into it looking for

36
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:52,039
something banana and I found anything

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,000
but it was burnt match heads bad perm

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,240
like this this I mean just a complete

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
opposite but in the best way like you

40
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,839
know I went in looking for one thing and

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,599
what I found wasn't that but it was so

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,320
much better you know it I didn't go into

43
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,159
it looking for something kind of on that

44
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,639
funky really almost burnt nasty end but

45
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,959
it yeah it's so awesome and it it kicks

46
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,839
it kicks really good would it be fair to

47
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,479
say that you're kind of into those

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,759
offensive tpin oh we can have a whole

49
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,238
discussion about the pooping fetish this

50
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,039
has become a a very a very hot

51
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,480
discussion topic lately um we've we've

52
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,239
probably discussed it on six or eight

53
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:35,598
different podcasts um the growing fetish

54
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:39,039
of describing just how nasty and foul

55
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,199
and odiferous your weed is and just that

56
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,639
become a whole subculture now of the

57
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:48,158
more spoiled rancid rank the better you

58
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,359
know and uh yeah it's it's becoming a

59
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:52,000
new thing of just there's a whole

60
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,599
subculture of people that hit me up and

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,158
it's just like what's the nasty you got

62
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,318
anything it smells like a old diaper

63
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,120
that's been out for two weeks I'm like

64
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,919
yeah I'm sure I got something for you

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
man like well you know they don't call

66
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,280
me tur for nothing we'll definitely put

67
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,399
you with a flavor um but that's become

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,039
like you know it it kind of became one

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,158
of those things like we all kind of do

70
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,280
it a little bit and then we started

71
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,878
talking about the fact that we all do it

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,640
a lot and we're like yeah I'm looking

73
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:22,639
for that like burn burnt perm wrapped in

74
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:25,559
hair with some skunk and you know a baby

75
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,719
diaper and uh yeah it's it's just the

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,400
the descriptions descriptions and the

77
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,840
descriptors of of rancid weed has become

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,000
a whole subculture lately I think a big

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,840
part of that is the shock value attached

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,799
to it like right you know if I say hey

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,438
I've got something that's super

82
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,319
blueberry turine you're going to be like

83
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:45,318
okay there's a lot of

84
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,879
blueberry but if I'm like okay well you

85
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,840
know what you got R Hill skunk you got

86
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,039
your tennis ball and everything but I've

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,120
got this Pakistani chocolate tie that's

88
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,719
[ __ ] tastes like you're sucking on

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,319
the wet stuff that's at the bottom of

90
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,158
your garbage trash you're gonna be like

91
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:05,280
oh you know it's the shock value it's

92
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,798
what lot a lot of other artists a lot of

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,959
it's kind of been on the back of like a

94
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,879
lot of the chem strains I found like as

95
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,438
those of GMO and stuff like that as

96
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,959
those kind of strains have become more

97
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,959
popular you're starting to see a lot

98
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,600
more of like

99
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,639
Savory you know stuff that's not just

100
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:29,600
simple fruit turps right and the people

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,680
that love it love it I mean love it but

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,479
there's a lot of people that go I don't

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,918
know if I want my weed to smell like

104
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,599
diarrhea and the truth is it's it's a

105
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,519
niche that's why I kind of call it the

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,400
pooping fetish is it is very much a

107
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:46,120
niche thing and the people that love

108
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,758
those funky nasty turps that's what

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,319
they're looking for they don't they're

110
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
almost the sort of people that don't

111
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,000
want fruity weed you know you have to

112
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,638
appreciate that everybody's got a flavor

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,879
everybody's got a C everybody's got

114
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,120
something that they're really into you

115
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,719
know so it's like I've always said my

116
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,038
whole thing from minute one was to try

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
and cover all the bases so anybody that

118
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,639
hit me up and said I want a flavor I got

119
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
something for you and it really doesn't

120
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,360
matter what corner or niche of the weed

121
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,719
Market you're into I try to focus on a

122
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,400
little bit of something across the board

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,479
so any customer hits me up and says hey

124
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,120
I need a I need a gassy strain I need a

125
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,800
fruity strain I need a strain that's

126
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,879
just TPS beyond anything anybody's seen

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,038
I got you I got you okay let me get

128
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:36,240
personal with yeah you've got something

129
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:39,240
for everybody uh what's for T FEI see

130
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,319
that's where it comes from man so it

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,319
comes from a I have tolerance issues

132
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,160
I've been smoking for a little while so

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,560
there's a little bit of the thing that I

134
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,720
found to deal with that the best is to

135
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,160
constantly keep a different strain on

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,000
Deck so I have real bad add with any

137
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
strain in that I'll smoke it and then 15

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
minutes later later it was the greatest

139
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,799
thing I ever had but I'm over it now and

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,639
so a lot of it comes from just my desire

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,038
and my need to find stronger strains to

142
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,639
find strains that fit particular niches

143
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,478
and anything that'll kick through that

144
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,038
tolerance issue of like you know look

145
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,199
man I'm I'm traditionally a Dabber like

146
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,120
90% of the time I'm I'm smoking hash um

147
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,038
I found it kind of easier to smoke flour

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,759
on podcast so like it's one of those

149
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,079
things that you know I'll puff a couple

150
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,199
joints but yeah I mean really in my

151
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,879
pursuit of flour it's always been flavor

152
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,800
unique and something that'll cut through

153
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,598
something that's going to get you know

154
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,520
past everything else and that's usually

155
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,879
the jar I grab it's tough to say what my

156
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,799
favorite that a little bit

157
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,519
more which part they cut cut through

158
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,759
what do you mean oh so yeah so like I'm

159
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,959
just saying like I'm looking for a

160
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,199
strain that if I have eight jars on the

161
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,638
table that's the one that's going to

162
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,960
kick me the hardest so that's the one

163
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm going to grab like I always say it's

164
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,478
the jar that go bre SE barrier yep yep

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,519
Goa and see the big the big problem that

166
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:11,719
we have one of the big problems that I

167
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,079
feel like we have in cannabis right now

168
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,720
is kind of the

169
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,800
misconception that high THC is the best

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
and that's it so when you walk into a

171
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,478
dispensary when you're buying weed it's

172
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,120
just what's the THC

173
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,478
content that is not the best way to buy

174
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,079
weed and quite simply because the

175
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,800
highest THC isn't always going to be the

176
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,918
one gets you the highest I know that

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,240
sounds funny because your immediate

178
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:43,159
thought is 18% is not going to get me as

179
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:45,918
high as 30% weed the truth is 18% with

180
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,560
high mercine levels will get you higher

181
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,639
than 30% weed and I know that sounds

182
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,038
funny but we have you know we have a ton

183
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,800
of discussions all the time about uh

184
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,199
anary tping about you know tping in

185
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,280
general and how they modulate

186
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,598
specifically mering and we've known for

187
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,799
years and years mercine helps THC cross

188
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,360
the blood brain barrier so that's why

189
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,720
for years you heard the joke about eat

190
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,439
some mangoes or you know chew on some

191
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,240
peppercorn peppercorns you ever chewed

192
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,038
on peppercorn that's some that's

193
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,079
hardcore bro a heavier cararo filing or

194
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,878
is there a significant amount of mercing

195
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,758
there's also significant amounts of of

196
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,000
mercine and so with with those higher

197
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,960
elevated and that's generally why mercy

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,360
and in most of my strains I like that to

199
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,359
be the first tarpine on the list the one

200
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,839
that has the the most turps of all the

201
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,879
others because quite simply you're going

202
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,519
to get higher now what I've seen this

203
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,479
from is I'll take strains that are 18

204
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,120
20% but with higher mercing levels and

205
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,680
I'll have people come back and say I

206
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,039
can't smoke that like I've had people

207
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,639
literally tell me like my customers are

208
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,838
afraid of the blackout truffle just

209
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:56,679
simply because it's a higher mercine

210
00:08:51,839 --> 00:09:00,560
strain you know 20% 20% plus THC so no

211
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:04,039
slouch but it's like 30% THC usually

212
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:07,278
comes at the sake of sacrificing turbs

213
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,399
like there's only so much room in a tri

214
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,519
so if if in that triome the predominant

215
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,679
oil is THC the predominant chemical is

216
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,959
THC there's less room for other stuff

217
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,479
and so we're you know there there will

218
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,399
always be a market for high THC strains

219
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,560
like that's just it's the marketability

220
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,879
it's easy to sell your average customer

221
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,838
says THC yeah but as we go down the line

222
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,159
more and more we start to realize that

223
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,839
heavy TPS and the right turp Blends

224
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,679
matter a lot more than 30% tpps I mean

225
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,560
30% THC and so that's why I say for me

226
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,078
as much as I love flavors and I love

227
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,359
different flavors and I love you know

228
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:49,359
for me it's the variety for me it's the

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,200
chase for me it's what haven't I seen

230
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,320
yet because I've seen some awesome

231
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,360
strains you know through 20 years plus

232
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,800
of popping seeds like I I've seen I've

233
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,560
seen the evolution of weed As We Know it

234
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,599
you know I I started growing in the in

235
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,119
the late

236
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,480
90s um to be honest there weren't

237
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,560
genetically there weren't a ton of

238
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,159
options back there back then your

239
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:16,319
options were either mark emer's

240
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,360
catalog Amsterdam maybe go to Canada I

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,959
that was that was about it in general

242
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,680
there wasn't nearly the flood of genetic

243
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:28,199
diversity that we have today um and then

244
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,958
not only that but the the problems that

245
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,519
we encountered trying to acquire

246
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:35,879
genetics or even having them in our area

247
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,839
limited that pool even more for

248
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,278
sure and that's something that we were

249
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,920
talking about the other day is some of

250
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,679
those old strains you know you get a

251
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,759
nice Panama Red or something like that

252
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,199
that's only testing what 15 to 18%

253
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,159
that's not what it is it's the canabo

254
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,278
profile and it's how those canabo

255
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,319
interact with each other to give you

256
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,240
that high that's the most important

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,040
thing absolutely absolutely and the

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,919
thing that we're seeing kind of

259
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,120
now so back in the 90s when I started

260
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:07,000
growing there were still a lot of those

261
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,879
very basic profile strains so it was

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,320
either piny or it was skunky or it was

263
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,360
Berry but back then it was kind of rare

264
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,639
that you would hit a strain and you'd go

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
man there's so much going on here I

266
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,519
can't really describe all of this you

267
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,320
know and in the world of poly hybrids in

268
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,000
the world of you know everybody with a

269
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,920
closet can be a breeder and can make

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,120
their own seeds um we're we're really

271
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,159
now seeing the TR diversity of the gene

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,480
pool oh yeah because it's there's more

273
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,559
people breeding now more people growing

274
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,039
weed than at any point in history um the

275
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,000
sheer amount of weed that's being grown

276
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:45,000
because it's done legally in so many

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,278
places now is far surpassing anything

278
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,159
we've ever seen and the Beautiful part

279
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,240
of that is we're seeing the expansion of

280
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,719
the genan pool at such a rate

281
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,799
that it's it's really tough to tell you

282
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,639
what what tomorrow holds in the simple

283
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,000
fact that we're also seeing along with

284
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,560
all these poly hybrids and all these you

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,399
know multi crosses we're also seeing so

286
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,319
many people going back to some of the

287
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,839
older stuff you're seeing people

288
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,278
reworking old stuff you're seeing people

289
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,839
who bust open seed collections after 10

290
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,519
15 years and really just start to pull

291
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,680
out stuff that you know it it meant

292
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,399
something to them they collected it um

293
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,399
but the tragedy of that is you know we

294
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,078
keep getting into this discussion about

295
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,559
W without kicking up a bunch of mud

296
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,838
skunk for instance skunk's one of those

297
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,439
profiles that everybody talks about it's

298
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,880
gone it's gone we lost all the good

299
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,120
skunk we lost all the good skunk well

300
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,278
why like why do you think that's the

301
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,120
case and the answer is usually because

302
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,720
those older plants didn't adapt as well

303
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,278
to indoor cultivation they were

304
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,480
specifically bred in whatever region

305
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:58,958
they came from largely to be outdoor

306
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,560
plants grown in specific environments

307
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,239
and as everything moved indoors you know

308
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,000
plants that didn't keep up plants that

309
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,799
hmed too much with skunk particularly

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,919
plants that grew 20 feet tall and didn't

311
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:14,559
really yield all that much weight those

312
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,958
plants didn't make it long term and so

313
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,518
that's why I tell people all the time

314
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:22,159
what's really important is if you love a

315
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,240
plant make more seeds of it find a way

316
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,240
to make more seeds because that

317
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,839
guarantees that whatever profile you

318
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,198
love whatever plant you're in love with

319
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,079
makes it to another generation and it

320
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,319
can be tomorrow's favorite strain too

321
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,599
you know we don't have to get there and

322
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,120
be like you remember that one strand in

323
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,240
the day I wish we'd have kept it you can

324
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,759
do that you know find find two seeds and

325
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,320
breed them find your two favorite

326
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,198
strains and breed them together you know

327
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
you really be surprised man and that's

328
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:52,319
what makes sure that those favorite

329
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,120
strains that you loved from yester year

330
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,800
make it on to the next generation and

331
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,399
make it you know to somebody else to

332
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,000
talk about down the

333
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,399
road isn't take much work to do a

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,519
preservation effort and you know it's

335
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,799
something that's extremely important

336
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,679
especially for the future of cannabis I

337
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,278
remember talking to a patreon member

338
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,319
just like yesterday I think it was um

339
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,278
about how back when I started smoking

340
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,278
almost everything tasted like Pine like

341
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,120
heavy pining or heavy mercing there

342
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,958
wasn't a lot of genetic diversity maybe

343
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,039
when we started getting some orange butt

344
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,078
up from Cali or from Nevada um but

345
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,198
almost everything tastes the same but it

346
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,958
had kind of a different look or it was a

347
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,599
little bit heavier in this tpine than

348
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,399
the other one you know but uh about the

349
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,920
time of like white widow White Rhino BC

350
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,759
bud and all that Northern Lights like

351
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,439
that's mainly what it was right um but I

352
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,159
think an important thing to note like

353
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,959
you were saying the genetic diversity

354
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,639
that we have we have all these uh tping

355
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,439
that you just don't find in cannabis

356
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,120
showing up more and more often uh the

357
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
more breeders that are out out there the

358
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,560
more people that are breeding towards

359
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,360
these different traits than we've ever

360
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,719
seen before not only that but like uh

361
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,680
when I did the Egyptian land race this

362
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,440
Sinai uh I always say siai say it [ __ ]

363
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:18,039
up but that was one that was very heavy

364
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,920
in granal and granal I was looking at

365
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,559
because it was apparently the turpine

366
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,198
that was responsible for like stone

367
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,359
fruit and Peach flavors but that

368
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:30,919
tpine doesn't just Express as Peach it

369
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,159
can express multitude of ways along that

370
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,000
spectrum and that's not just that one

371
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,439
tpine that's [ __ ] how many is there I

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,360
don't even know right so kind of what

373
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,880
you're what you're knocking on here kind

374
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,680
of goes back a little bit to what we

375
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:48,399
were talking about uh in the the kind of

376
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:51,278
the early to mid 90s as you started to

377
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,198
see more breeding specifically in

378
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:58,198
cannabis right it was generally for high

379
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:01,838
THC they were largely breeding for heavy

380
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,719
Tri comes heavy resin but at that time

381
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,880
most people weren't breeding for tur

382
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,120
beans so in that push to breed higher

383
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:14,240
THC and higher THC strains you generally

384
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,039
phased out so many ancillary turpins so

385
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,360
many of those turpins that maybe only

386
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:22,198
appear in smaller amounts and so as

387
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,560
we're seeing now the other thing that we

388
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,799
see now is the rise in testing so we now

389
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,758
have more access to testing turpine

390
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,879
testing cannaboid testing than we've

391
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,039
ever had before it's still not perfect

392
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,278
like you as as a person on the street

393
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:39,879
can't really just take a 100 samples and

394
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:41,799
send them to a lab and get TP tests but

395
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,360
all of the dispensaries all the legal

396
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:47,359
entities that are running grows right

397
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,079
now all have access to testing of some

398
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,199
sort so what that's doing is we're also

399
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,719
we're starting to see all of these

400
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,679
strains that we've had for years and

401
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,560
years and years being run out documented

402
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,638
with test results right right and now

403
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,279
we're starting to see that there are

404
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,640
other turpins there that we weren't even

405
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,959
paying attention to and whether it's a

406
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,520
concerted effort to actually breed for

407
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,679
specific turp flavors or it's just an

408
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,279
effort to we're not as concerned with

409
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,000
high THC now we're willing to breed for

410
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:22,078
other things like flavor and for you

411
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,640
know cont other content other than just

412
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,759
THC so so with so many breeders you

413
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,200
might have a favorite flavor and it

414
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,679
might be some strain that's really high

415
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,038
in some unique or odd tarpine and I say

416
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,480
really high really high in comparison

417
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,960
right some of these TPS that you're

418
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,519
mentioning and especially some of the

419
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,440
ancillary TPS that are kind of there in

420
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:48,200
smaller amounts when I see these turp

421
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,798
wheels and it's like this turp smells

422
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,400
like you know lavender and this turp

423
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,240
smells like it's so tough because in

424
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,600
that triome is a soup of different

425
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Tarpin uh you know thigh of there's all

426
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,439
kinds of flavor molecules we still don't

427
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,038
know what all is there yeah because the

428
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,360
best labs are only testing for turpins

429
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:13,400
and cannaboids most of them aren't

430
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:16,439
testing I haven't seen at least full

431
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,280
spectrum tests of everything that's in

432
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,080
that resin you know that's that's in in

433
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,200
the triome and that's the real kick

434
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,879
right now is we keep bringing up every

435
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,200
time we talk about turps somebody brings

436
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,159
up gas somebody brings up gassy turps

437
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,000
and THS and skunky tpps and th we still

438
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,600
don't

439
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,440
know what all is there yeah because it's

440
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,199
not something you can really just call

441
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
up a lab and say Hey I want to test for

442
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,440
THS in my cannabis those places don't do

443
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,158
that that's not to say they can't but

444
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,640
I've never seen a full write up of every

445
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,600
single thing that's in cannabis resin so

446
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,720
it's like we're still only seeing a

447
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,279
small piece of the picture you know

448
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,839
we're we're seeing the part that we're

449
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,399
looking at and there's still so many

450
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,959
other things going on there that we

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,320
still don't really we we're either not

452
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,960
capable of testing for or we just don't

453
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,200
understand I think that's a big thing

454
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,200
about you know it's not federally legal

455
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
so there's not as much testing that we

456
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,480
can do on it but I'm really glad that

457
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,158
you brought that up because you're

458
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,000
you're right there is so many turpins

459
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,679
that we know of already I don't remember

460
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,200
how many anymore is it right under

461
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,679
something like that the other side to it

462
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,000
is it's all commercial based so it's

463
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,759
like all of the testing that's generally

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,919
happening happens for one of two reasons

465
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,720
state

466
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,320
regulations or marketing

467
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,079
curiosity right that's kind of all of

468
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,038
the Cannabis Testing that happens you

469
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,720
have to test for things like pesticides

470
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:54,400
and THC in some states some states

471
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,839
require tpine testing some don't um but

472
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,640
the truth is those are all done because

473
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,399
it's not in a scientific method you know

474
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,799
it's not because we're just curious

475
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,360
about what all is here and we just want

476
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:07,918
to look and see or you know it's just

477
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,678
that's not why it's done it's all

478
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,240
literally done to either pass

479
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,759
inspections

480
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,720
or because you can use it to Market and

481
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,919
say oh we have you know High TPS in this

482
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,759
and high TPS you know but most tpping

483
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,080
testing is is it's not done as in an

484
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,400
exploratory way you know what I'm saying

485
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,839
it's not can we figure out what all is

486
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
here it's just give me something I can

487
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,480
use to Market my strain better when I

488
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,759
put it on a shelf to somebody you know

489
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,759
yeah I'm glad that you brought that up

490
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,359
though like I was going to say not only

491
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,038
like we talked about can one turpine

492
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,959
Express you know variety of different

493
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,119
smells um but how it interacts with

494
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,159
other tpping as well is going to change

495
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:57,038
that profile so I might inbred line uh

496
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:58,960
this granal tpine within my Heritage so

497
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:02,038
much where everything's is expressing

498
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,038
Peach but the minute it comes in contact

499
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,240
with a new chirping that's not used to

500
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,440
is really going to change that profile

501
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,640
to where it doesn't Express exactly

502
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,360
Peach anymore right

503
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,000
right pretty amazing uh Jesse harle

504
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,000
wants to know in terms of

505
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,599
say he wanted oh guys if you have

506
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,760
questions throw them back up I [ __ ] up

507
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,839
the

508
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:33,879
Q&amp;A um but he wanted to know if had any

509
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:35,918
problem fuing seeds if he fued seeds oh

510
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,840
no no no no no no no no and I'm kind of

511
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,120
glad this came up because this is

512
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,359
probably one of my three or four

513
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:45,319
favorite topics to talk about so I'm a

514
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,678
firm believer in open source

515
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,798
genetics if you purchase a pack of seeds

516
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,960
those seeds are yours to do as you

517
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:56,599
please if there's male plants there and

518
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,558
there's female plants there you paid for

519
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:03,759
those plants those plants belong to you

520
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:06,639
and how you use them is up to you um if

521
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,960
that means you F2 and and and sell them

522
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,520
that means you F2 them and give them

523
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,640
away to everybody on the planet it's

524
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,038
your prerogative man um I I I'm a firm

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,480
believer that if you're selling regular

526
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,558
sex seeds you paid for all of those

527
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,599
seeds they belong to you and what you

528
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:29,639
want to do with them I have no control

529
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:32,879
over I always tell people I always

530
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,240
appreciate a pack if you shoot me a pack

531
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,120
just so I can throw it in the bin and I

532
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,440
have a pack but it's not required and

533
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,918
it's one of those things that I tell

534
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,919
other people ask your breeder that

535
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,360
question and see how many of them tell

536
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,159
you no I got no problem with it because

537
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,918
there's a lot of people in the in the

538
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:56,400
seed industry that will get super angry

539
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,880
about that will throw fits I had an old

540
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,038
man try to swing on me mons and it it

541
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,039
it's the

542
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,879
funniest you know the the ego and the

543
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:10,519
amount of like it's mine I'm gonna

544
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,559
control it you sold it to somebody and

545
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:16,319
you why you trying to fight nature 10

546
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,158
seeds they paid for all 10 of them yeah

547
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,759
it's there was nothing on that pack that

548
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,559
said you got to throw half of these in

549
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,919
the

550
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:28,038
garbage you know and it's the truth

551
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,759
is we all eat well it doesn't take a

552
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:35,079
dollar out of my pocket if you sell f2s

553
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:37,519
of my seeds people know that I made the

554
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,278
original and if they want the Next

555
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,918
Generation they're going to come to me

556
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:47,119
and the reality is I can't control it

557
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,640
anyway so why would I get angry to the

558
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,319
point where I want to fight somebody or

559
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,880
yell at people online I've seen so much

560
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,359
over you know people F2 and seeds and

561
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,559
then getting their feelings hurt and the

562
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,278
truth is

563
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:05,639
a lot of the people that get mad about

564
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:08,400
that paid stupid money for their Cuts

565
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,480
because they're usually suckers and

566
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,919
that's why they get so in their feelings

567
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,759
about it because they've paid a premium

568
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:21,080
to have the cut or the only cut or you

569
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,839
know and I don't really work with cuts

570
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,038
I'm I've never paid anybody a

571
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:26,918
significant amount of money for cuts

572
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,079
like I bought cuts at a dispensary once

573
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,000
years and years back but like I've never

574
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,960
paid somebody thousands of dollars for a

575
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,278
cut of weed nor would I um I'll just

576
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,440
wait until you cross it and then get

577
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,640
those and and make my own seats right I

578
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,960
hate to I hate to say it man but like I

579
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,399
believe firmly in open- Source genetics

580
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,759
I believe that you know you buy them

581
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:49,719
from the person that made them because

582
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,519
you love them and then what you do with

583
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,759
them is is you I mean that's you know

584
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,119
I'm not in every grow so I can't I can't

585
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,599
do anything about it even if you did but

586
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,918
I fully support people that do I always

587
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,719
joke these are all just crayons and my

588
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,120
my biggest desire is that one day

589
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,600
somebody takes one of my crayons and

590
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,038
paints a

591
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:14,719
masterpiece and in that we can all share

592
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:17,519
there's so much to go around there's no

593
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,759
lack of genetics if you really think one

594
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,278
cut is the end all be all cut pop some

595
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,679
more seeds because there's there's other

596
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,398
stuff out there there's better stuff out

597
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,880
there every time somebody shows me the

598
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:34,000
cut to end all Cuts I just go I hope you

599
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,278
didn't pay a lot for it man there

600
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,960
there's just better stuff out there and

601
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:39,880
it's not there's so much like I said

602
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,720
there's so much ego in like do you have

603
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,520
the cut is that the cut from such and

604
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,798
such like are you sure that's the only

605
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,839
cut can you verify that that's the I

606
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,278
don't

607
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:53,079
care I don't I don't care I don't care

608
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,200
to even have that discussion you know

609
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,759
like I would rather make my own

610
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,080
something amazing and sell it to you as

611
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,599
something amazing then just rip off

612
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,558
something somebody else is doing and

613
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,879
just say man I chased down this one cut

614
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:08,960
I paid $5,000 for it and now I'm gonna

615
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,760
pimp it out as hard as I can I just it's

616
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,319
not my thing I'm kind of old school I

617
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:15,558
like seeds you know like I said when I

618
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,798
came up there weren't a lot available to

619
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:20,319
me so once I could make them I literally

620
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,398
just thought of myself as like Johnny

621
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,319
apple seed like I just want to make all

622
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:26,319
the flavors and I want to try all the

623
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,439
flavors and I want to try and I want to

624
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,678
spread them as far as I can

625
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,480
and so I've always tried to keep my

626
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,038
genetics affordable we do tons of

627
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,440
giveaways and freebies and you know like

628
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,640
ways for people to to to get tons of

629
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,399
good genetics for reasonable prices and

630
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,600
so many people now they just assume

631
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:50,798
because it's an expensive pack of seeds

632
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,199
it's a great pack of seeds and I've I've

633
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,839
popped them all man like I I've popped

634
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,159
your six s $800 packs of seeds and I've

635
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,359
popped the stuff out of Joe's

636
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,520
closet nine times out of 10 I'm going to

637
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,479
go with the closet guy there's only one

638
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,278
or two people at that top Echelon of

639
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,159
price that I would spend my money

640
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:16,398
again and you know let's be honest like

641
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,640
most great genetics shouldn't be

642
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:21,678
expensive you know unless you're like I

643
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,679
said you're paying 10 grand for a

644
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,919
cut why let's let's throw a range on

645
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,759
this what do you think is an acceptable

646
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,159
and moral price for a pack of seeds uh

647
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,599
minimum to

648
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,480
Max if we're talking about anything

649
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:40,879
under an

650
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,880
F5 right 100

651
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,679
bucks you know is that Max yeah $100 is

652
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,359
the top end of what I you know and this

653
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,840
is as a buy listen man this is as a

654
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,719
buyer I'm not necessarily saying this is

655
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:54,959
somebody who eats off of seeds I'm

656
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,240
saying this as somebody who's spent 20

657
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,960
years collecting yeah yeah 20 years

658
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,038
colle collecting um you know 20 years

659
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:09,399
hoarding my own flavors and my own seeds

660
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:12,480
and you know and so for me if I'm buying

661
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:16,278
seeds and it's over a hundred bucks a

662
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,798
pack it better be something that I can't

663
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,720
live without which is real rare for me

664
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,599
like I said I don't I don't get attached

665
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,319
to strain so like there's nothing I've

666
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:27,038
ever had that I wouldn't just say I'll

667
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,960
find another one right you know I found

668
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,519
this one you know and

669
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,759
so if we're talking about something F5

670
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,839
or

671
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:40,319
higher then we get into like how big is

672
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,798
the breeder how well-known is the

673
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,038
breeder how well-known is the pedigree

674
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,398
of the genetics that we're talking about

675
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:50,278
if this is some stuff that they've been

676
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:52,639
growing in in Northern California for 40

677
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,240
years then you can usually guess that

678
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,679
this is of a pedigree that's a little

679
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,839
bit higher genetically than just a

680
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,240
somebody did in their closet you know

681
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,319
like there's it just depends on what

682
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,919
we're talking about but anything under

683
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,278
than anything under an F5 I'd have a

684
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,240
hard time paying crazy money for now

685
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:15,159
there's two brands that I would I would

686
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,000
I would kind of make an exception there

687
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,840
they're both kind of Legacy Brands out

688
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,880
of

689
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,079
California um and they're on the kind of

690
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,360
the upper

691
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,720
end um and I would I would buy their

692
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:30,639
seeds again in a minute let's be honest

693
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,038
man anado and dying breed are the only

694
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,480
two companies that I would 100% vouch

695
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,480
for every seed that I've popped was

696
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,038
worth every nickel that went into it um

697
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,319
I've been in a weird position like just

698
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:44,480
having an Instagram page and I had

699
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,200
people hit me up and just go man I got

700
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,960
all these seeds and we went to a cup and

701
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,120
we spent a bunch of money and now I'm

702
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,399
scared to pop them because they're so

703
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,079
expensive I feel like I'm G to I'm just

704
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,879
going to screw it up you know and it's

705
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,678
like so I had people come to me and like

706
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,840
trade me my seeds for stuff that they

707
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,720
had picked up at cups and couldn't you

708
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,439
know couldn't bring themselves to run

709
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,079
and so I had stuff kind of fall in my

710
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,600
lap at one time and I was just like I'm

711
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:13,519
going to run it all and see what's you

712
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:16,038
know what's worth running what's garbage

713
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,440
what's you know I'll never touch again

714
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:22,038
and in that price range there's a couple

715
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,038
other brands that you know I won't talk

716
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,759
negative on anybody um but there's a

717
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,839
couple other brands that I would I would

718
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,319
say or maybe not worth spending that

719
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,759
kind of money on unless it's just

720
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,480
something you can't live without you

721
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,319
know you're allowed to have your

722
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,558
opinions man yeah absolutely yeah

723
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,599
absolutely but if you don't know what

724
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,359
you're buying right if we're just

725
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,599
talking about the average seed buyer who

726
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,359
sees a a three to $500 pack and goes is

727
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:51,639
that worth my

728
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:54,119
money do the research really heavily at

729
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,320
that point you know it's one thing if

730
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:59,759
you buy a 6070 pack of seeds and you got

731
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:02,798
got 10 shots to find a winner and let's

732
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,638
say nothing comes of it that's a whole

733
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:09,000
lot different than when you've invested

734
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:10,879
$500 a pack and now every seed needs to

735
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,558
be a winner in your

736
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,840
eyes right you don't have the margin of

737
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:17,960
error because you've invested so much

738
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,759
this is I'm talking about your average

739
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,038
seed buyer I'm not talking about the guy

740
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,558
that's got 180,000 square foot in an

741
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,240
unlimited seed budget you know I'm

742
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,319
talking about your average collector

743
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
who's they been in it for a little while

744
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:34,240
here's these bigname Brands and then

745
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,798
goes what expensive it's got to be good

746
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,839
you know why would they charge so much

747
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:40,158
for it because they

748
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,839
can that's that's the only reason like

749
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,760
those genetics aren't super special

750
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,319
nobody's ever had them you know like

751
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,720
once again that goes back to the open-

752
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:52,759
source nature of

753
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,319
genetics there's in a ton of

754
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:59,398
[ __ ] several years ago um when I was

755
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:02,240
talking to two different breeders uh one

756
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,518
of them you actually named and we were

757
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,319
talking

758
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,558
about that cap that I just asked you

759
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:13,319
about and what's morally and ethically

760
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,839
right to charge for a pack of seeds and

761
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,000
we were talking about there was a couple

762
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:20,638
packs that a breeder had put up but they

763
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,240
were asking thousands of dollars for 10

764
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:27,199
seeds and I said that's it's not worth

765
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,159
it and I had another breeder that was

766
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,519
involved with that breeder hit me up

767
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,720
really go on the defense right away and

768
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,079
say well you don't know what you're

769
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,360
[ __ ] talking about these are you know

770
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,798
been held for so many generations and

771
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,240
everything I said at the end of the day

772
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:45,200
what's going to come out of that is a

773
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:48,558
plant albe it maybe an extremely inbred

774
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,880
well-worked beautiful plant it is still

775
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,879
a plant and I

776
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,880
can't being worth it at the end of the

777
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:01,840
day let's be honest okay deep filial

778
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,039
inbreeding is only good for

779
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,720
breeders right so as a

780
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:12,359
grower I would never I would never pay

781
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:15,038
that money for that ever exactly as a

782
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:18,079
breeder and that's why I get back to if

783
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,079
I'm paying you that kind of money I'm

784
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,918
paying you for the fact that you're

785
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:27,359
selling Legacy strains you're selling

786
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,120
pedigree genetics and I am going to use

787
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:33,439
them to breed with because that's the

788
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:38,319
only reason somebody would pay that kind

789
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,240
of money for those names as a grower

790
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,759
it's irrelevant like there's so many

791
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,200
hype strains out right now that like and

792
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,119
it's been a couple years I feel like

793
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,798
since we've had like a really big this

794
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,158
is the hype strain everybody has to have

795
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:53,679
you know I don't know if it's a little

796
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,559
post-pandemic lull High Times hasn't

797
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,679
been doing as many events to tell people

798
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,000
I people are nishing out more especially

799
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,720
you know with you me everybody kind of

800
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,720
moving towards Discord all right

801
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,600
Instagram shoving us off there

802
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,838
cancelling us out um YouTube's taking

803
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,838
down channels like Discord is I think

804
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,119
it's the future and I think people are

805
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,358
going to Niche out like that because I

806
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,838
don't have to follow a page of [ __ ]

807
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,398
and scroll through trying to find tur's

808
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,679
post today I can just go to tur's

809
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:28,358
Discord and check all that out I don't

810
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,639
have to just choose t i can choose tur I

811
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,918
can choose you know CeX and crew podcast

812
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,559
or whoever I follow and have multiple

813
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,918
Discord accounts that I can pop between

814
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,159
and find exactly what I'm looking for

815
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:43,319
you know and I think that's important to

816
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:45,800
note right now but like you said as well

817
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,559
um sadly from a Growers perspective I

818
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,960
think a lot of people nowadays like the

819
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:53,759
hype boy cut keeping guys uh are doing

820
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,079
that like you said equating this is a

821
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
high price this is going to be good for

822
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,640
me you know or this G to be something

823
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:04,440
extremely special and usually I find

824
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:07,118
that those people are basing more how

825
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,400
much money can I make off of finding a

826
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,400
really good one and selling cuts of it

827
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,480
than keeping it for myself the truth is

828
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,160
if we've run enough seeds if we've all

829
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,679
run enough strains you've

830
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:24,078
seen the most amazing top tier of

831
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,598
weed let's let's be honest dank weed is

832
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,640
dank weed like at at the best top point

833
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,920
of

834
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:34,639
cultivation then it all comes down to

835
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,800
flavor there's so much Frosty weed and

836
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,159
there's so much it's beautiful and it's

837
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,320
just gorgeous nugs but what does it

838
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,559
taste like that's what really has become

839
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,480
the deciding factor and I think that's

840
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:52,159
why we're seeing so many little

841
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:55,039
niches right is that it comes down to

842
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:57,480
flavor and and taste and people come to

843
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,519
realize well it's like hype doesn't

844
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,880
always mean it's the best hype usually

845
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,159
meant it looked pretty in a picture and

846
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,880
somebody posted it on the internet and

847
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,279
somebody else went I got to have that

848
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,039
you know or somebody in a marketing

849
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,440
company at one of these large brands has

850
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,960
essentially said now we're pushing out

851
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,280
XYZ strain we're going to have our

852
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,639
rapper WAP about it we're going to have

853
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,960
our marketing team hit every social

854
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,960
media hard with it it's going to be the

855
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,519
next thing everybody's talking about

856
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,519
that's usually what we're talking about

857
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,318
there is branding and marketing more

858
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:35,280
than just the most amazing strain of

859
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:37,719
weed um usually don't get me wrong

860
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,640
they're usually gorgeous but if you sit

861
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:42,598
down with 10 of the greatest growers in

862
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:46,440
this country right every one of them

863
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,480
have Frosty dank nugs the one that's

864
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,280
going to walk up from that table and

865
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,358
walk away being the one that knew they

866
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,920
had the Dank was the one whose jar stank

867
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,239
the most because we all have jars of

868
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,079
stank you you know like any great grower

869
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,000
has jars of stinky weed but the one

870
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:07,079
that's going to get everybody is that

871
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,639
flavor that makes all the ogs go what is

872
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,519
that I gotta have that the jar that goes

873
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,199
the fastest that's how we always joked

874
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:15,679
about it if we all sat down and threw

875
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,639
our jars in the middle of the table and

876
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,838
you could smoke anything you wanted all

877
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,159
day long the jar that empties the

878
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,880
fastest is going to be the best

879
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,118
one and that's almost never just the the

880
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,599
most resinous one it's always the

881
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,119
dankest flavor patreon member dank Panda

882
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,640
wants to know I have a pineapple

883
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,559
meatball F2 and veg that smells of rank

884
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,838
feet and vomit will it hold or get more

885
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,199
putrid and

886
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,838
flour so if you haven't gotten the

887
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,559
pineapple flavor on that yet like so

888
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:49,838
some of those kind of go both ways

889
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:52,159
there's kind of a funky pooping uh I

890
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:55,880
heard people say Italian meatballs it

891
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:57,639
get really weird and savory meat um and

892
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,200
then there's some that have more

893
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,759
pineapple and then there's some that

894
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,358
kind of have both it sounds like you've

895
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,560
got the more meat breath leaning

896
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,279
feno um and yeah I would I would expect

897
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,639
that one to make your friends kind of

898
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,920
run like that one you bust that one out

899
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,239
in the car and somebody's going to think

900
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,119
they [ __ ] themselves um yeah and once

901
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,479
again man like that I in my selections

902
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,680
I'm not sure you said F2 um when I did

903
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,760
the f2s and the f3s my goal was to work

904
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,440
with plants that exhibited kind of an

905
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,720
even mix

906
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,159
because I think that strain really

907
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,679
shines when it's got both the kind of

908
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,559
funky rancid stuff but it's also got

909
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,399
this candy pineapple thing on the top

910
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,920
and it really does kind of remind you of

911
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,519
like a a burnt ham with pineapple rindes

912
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,519
on it or something like it's it's really

913
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,159
unique and Meaty um but but my favorite

914
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,358
ones are kind of an even blend of the

915
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,519
two um I've also selected in that line

916
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,598
away from what I I like to call the

917
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:02,079
mutant Leaf Fen knows of meat breath um

918
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,280
you can usually tell them about you know

919
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,920
a couple weeks into veg all the leaves

920
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,440
just throw this ugly mutation and you

921
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,079
just go what's wrong with this and it's

922
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,000
just it's it really just is a leaf

923
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:17,240
mutation but I found those plants don't

924
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
tend to be as vigorous as you know

925
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:22,879
profile typical as I like those tend to

926
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,719
have just a boring cushy profile as much

927
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,000
as I love Kush like that's not that

928
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,039
wasn't my goal with that line that line

929
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,318
in general all those pineapple sorbet

930
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:35,400
crosses just unbelievably complex and

931
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:37,239
unique um and that meatball yeah you're

932
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,000
probably stuck with the funk on that one

933
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,759
I hope that's what you like if you need

934
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,559
to we're going to start a uh we're gonna

935
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,680
start a group essentially you know a

936
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,920
support group we we'll figure out where

937
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,519
um we'll just call it poopin Anonymous

938
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,079
or pooping fetish Anonymous um and we'll

939
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,599
just we'll just have a forum where

940
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,800
people can kind of talk dirty to each

941
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,400
other about the the the rank of their

942
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,400
weed and whether it you know they can

943
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,519
argue about whether it smells like feed

944
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:10,240
or you know bad little sub threads G

945
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,599
really there really there really needs

946
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,000
to be a place for these people to gather

947
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,359
um that guy seemed like he might have

948
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,760
had a little bit of it and been looking

949
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,838
for a place to find other likeminded uh

950
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,480
pooping heavy individuals I've got an

951
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,559
appreciation for a little bit of

952
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,358
everything uh I I do love my pooping I

953
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:33,599
love some nasty [ __ ] uh I just feel like

954
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:36,400
those ones whatever is going on with a

955
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,559
lot of those style heavy ones just get

956
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,519
my head right that that high is the high

957
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:45,000
that I typically look for not always um

958
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:47,759
but in general another one is Dynasty

959
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,920
genetics I grow a lot of their gear and

960
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,960
he mostly does like sweeter Berry stuff

961
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,880
you know um but yours is one that I've

962
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,760
definitely been looking at as well I've

963
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,960
never grown own any of your genetics but

964
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,480
I really want to it's very you already

965
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,039
sent me some SE okay I I mean I'm giving

966
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,400
them to other people but if you don't if

967
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,400
you don't have seed around I'd be more

968
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,160
than happy to pay for it man that's that

969
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,559
that is morally and ethically correct uh

970
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:18,519
you know I've gotten seeds from breeders

971
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,679
before uh but I always always offer to

972
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,000
pay and I still do even you know I'd

973
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:25,519
never have to pay for seeds uh from a

974
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,679
lot of these people I could just ask for

975
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,280
them but I still pay for them just

976
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,318
because I think that's important you

977
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,720
know if you got a homie that has a

978
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:36,880
business like that you you don't have

979
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,759
like I have one friend that started up a

980
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,039
restaurant it's like a festar restaurant

981
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,160
it's big money like to go in there it's

982
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,880
going to be an expensive meal yeah but

983
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:46,799
I'm still going to go in there and I'm

984
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,480
still going to spend money I'm not going

985
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,560
to expect a free meal because this is my

986
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,280
friend and I want to support them you

987
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,880
know I think that's what's important

988
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,119
with we're still even like how many

989
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,119
times that's happened to us and we go in

990
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,680
and then the friend still comps the meal

991
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,800
you better tip that waitress 20% on top

992
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:08,399
of what the meal was going to cost and

993
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,839
that lady just had the best night of her

994
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,480
life like you better still leave that

995
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,440
money in that business because that's BR

996
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,400
that's the truth of it is that you know

997
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,880
so much of us that that run businesses

998
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,920
on our own um it's it's so much bigger

999
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,800
than any one facet right you have to be

1000
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,000
the marketing team and you have to be

1001
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,440
the you know the the grow and you have

1002
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,480
to be you have to do it all yourself and

1003
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,639
especially in this business the ones

1004
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,519
that are still doing it now even people

1005
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,400
that love it because the 2020 boom came

1006
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,318
everybody had those stimulus checks it

1007
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,680
was easy to be a seed vendor for a year

1008
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:46,599
and a half there and lots of people made

1009
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,639
money but the last year year and a half

1010
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,039
man you know it separated a lot of those

1011
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,639
people that were just here for a quick

1012
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,159
Buck um so many of those quick seed

1013
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:58,039
banks folded and you know that's the

1014
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,358
business I've seen so many of these bust

1015
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:03,480
and Booms to the point where it's like

1016
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:05,838
it's not uncommon for people right now

1017
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,760
to not be in this industry in a year and

1018
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:11,078
a half you know it's easy to do weed for

1019
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,440
a year year and a half it's a lot

1020
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,000
tougher to do it for 15 20 years plus

1021
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,838
because you have to change with the

1022
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,599
market you have to realize that the

1023
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:24,519
market is changing you know if you were

1024
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:27,760
selling flour 14 15 16 you know you had

1025
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:29,920
a hard realization the market changed

1026
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,720
drastically when all these huge legal

1027
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,838
grows came online in in legal states the

1028
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,358
flower market changed probably

1029
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:39,239
irreparably at this point like I don't I

1030
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,039
don't know if we'll ever see some of the

1031
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,479
the high water marks of you know what

1032
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,480
people were getting for for flour there

1033
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,960
and it's like so many people have

1034
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,280
shifted now into seeds because once

1035
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,760
again there's there's still reasonable

1036
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,240
money if you know how to Market yourself

1037
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,400
and but yeah it's it's you got to love

1038
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:01,279
it you have to love legalization there's

1039
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,599
still a market for craft cannabis I

1040
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,920
think that's really important uh just

1041
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,838
you know if we're going to compare uh

1042
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,760
different drugs uh then we should be

1043
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:12,599
comparing this to alcohol if that's how

1044
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,319
you're trying to regulate it then we

1045
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:19,000
should compare it to that and there's

1046
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:20,639
still a niche for those Craft Market um

1047
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,400
and at the end of the day with more

1048
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:26,440
people getting into cannabis um you're

1049
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,160
not going to see that big money Rush

1050
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,039
it's just like any other industry when

1051
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,159
it starts up when it's limited there's

1052
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,838
big money in it after a while you're

1053
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:38,318
going to notice it's still agriculture

1054
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,400
you know farming agriculture is tough

1055
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,079
yeah yeah it's farming that's what

1056
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,280
nobody tells anybody that gets in the

1057
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,440
weed industry nobody ever straight tells

1058
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,480
you farming it's a farming it's indoor

1059
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,838
farming which is very unnatural like for

1060
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,119
90% of the people who aren't growing in

1061
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:56,920
you know Open Fields which I I don't see

1062
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,000
too many commercial grow grows like that

1063
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,519
yeah it's unnatural you know and we're

1064
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,358
trying to play God and we're trying to

1065
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:06,000
create you know environments that are

1066
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:08,078
perfect and we're trying to you know and

1067
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,559
I don't know man I keep saying that

1068
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,119
every business that's in business right

1069
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,920
now as soon as it goes federally legal

1070
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:19,400
within three years we'll get bought out

1071
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,760
by a bigger company and once again all

1072
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,400
these people will be pushed out of the

1073
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,599
industry who were largely just here to

1074
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,960
make a quick Buck funny enough it's been

1075
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,760
de de ad since weed was a quick Buck you

1076
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,519
know if you were growing in the late 90s

1077
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,280
or early 2000s and you were brave and

1078
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:39,480
you had a decent sized Black Market grow

1079
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,200
you were probably eaten okay but the

1080
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,240
overhead and you know it's always been a

1081
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:45,558
tough business and the notion that

1082
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,598
you're just going to make a bunch of

1083
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:50,960
quick fast money like I've seen people

1084
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,920
make decent money just moving packs like

1085
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,760
just middlemen but like I've never known

1086
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,720
an intensely wealthy grower

1087
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,200
you know like even the people that run

1088
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,558
most of these large cannabis companies

1089
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,838
aren't weed people they're people who

1090
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,880
made money in real estate who made money

1091
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:10,960
in some other facet they've got

1092
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,800
investors most of them aren't people

1093
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,838
that spent their lives in a cannabis

1094
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,720
grow and most of those people are still

1095
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:20,440
just growing on their own because

1096
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,799
there's really no money working in

1097
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,679
another person's grow making you know

1098
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:30,079
what amounts to for some people people

1099
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:32,239
McDonald's manager salary or less you

1100
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,599
know like they're not throwing tons of

1101
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:37,479
money at Great Growers and that's why

1102
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:39,760
you've got so much mediocre weed in

1103
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,559
dispensaries is because it's grown by a

1104
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,760
coary of who just got off the bus 22 23

1105
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,920
year old kids who just love weed and

1106
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,839
they will work for nothing just to tell

1107
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,480
their family back home they're working

1108
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,440
in a weed grow little do they know that

1109
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,719
job only lasts about six months to a

1110
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,440
year because once a year they do

1111
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,919
cyclical firing get rid of everybody

1112
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,960
there and bring in the next set of

1113
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,639
20-year-old kids who can do it for less

1114
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,960
money than you just

1115
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,799
did pretty s that's why all the weed and

1116
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,679
dis if you want a quick fast on why all

1117
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,318
the weed and dispos sucks that's it

1118
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:15,799
right there before we move on to some

1119
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:19,358
more questions I wanted to ask you you

1120
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:23,839
said you started growing in uh the 90s

1121
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:25,440
early 90s mid late 90s late 90s okay uh

1122
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,279
what was some of those first types that

1123
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,200
you were grow so the first handful of

1124
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,519
plants that I ever grew were bag seed

1125
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:35,679
you know and so you kind of you kind of

1126
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,239
mentioned before we started about

1127
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,000
chatting about some things that kind of

1128
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:44,639
was into so at about

1129
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,639
16 156 I did my first fish

1130
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:52,400
show uh fall

1131
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:54,639
97 um from then like that opened my eyes

1132
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,200
in a huge way to weed in general because

1133
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:01,039
I had you know so much more access and

1134
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:04,000
so occasionally you just get some great

1135
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:07,279
weed with just a sprig nugget here just

1136
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,400
a seed here or there you know kind of

1137
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,680
set those aside and once we finally got

1138
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,358
to a point where we were like let's just

1139
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,239
try it let's just throw some plants in

1140
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,719
the woods and let's just give it a

1141
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,959
go I had some you know I don't even

1142
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,078
honestly probably didn't even know what

1143
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,440
it was it was bag seed from fish tour of

1144
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:26,280
some

1145
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:29,639
sort and then at some point um I got on

1146
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,559
to probably IC mag was the first Forum

1147
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,480
where I reached out like I spent a lot

1148
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,680
of time lurking on early

1149
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,880
overgrow uh we had a computer in our

1150
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:43,279
house in like the late 80s so like I saw

1151
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:46,720
the entirety of the internet Bloom and

1152
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,680
Blossom and so as you know overgrow

1153
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:52,199
became a thing and then got shut down I

1154
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,519
did a lot of lurking there uh you know

1155
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:57,919
probably picked up my first BHO tech

1156
00:48:54,519 --> 00:49:01,519
there um um tons of you know subcool

1157
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,440
super soil stuff and you know stuff that

1158
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,880
honest to God was was so valuable and

1159
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,880
just teaching me um because back then I

1160
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,920
felt like everybody wasn't an expert

1161
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,079
that's been my big beef with like forums

1162
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,838
for a while I always joke it's just

1163
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,079
experts telling experts how to be

1164
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:20,880
experts now nobody's ever just like I'm

1165
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,760
learning something like I'm here to

1166
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,519
learn a lot of it is just everybody

1167
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,520
wants to boss and say no that's not

1168
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:29,440
right you're absolutely wrong that's not

1169
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:31,199
the way to do it um and so for a long

1170
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
time I just lurked on these forums and

1171
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,159
sucked up as much as I could and I think

1172
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,760
it was around IC mag probably in the

1173
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,239
early

1174
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,640
2000s um the 2000 2001 2002 that I

1175
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,118
finally reached out and was just like

1176
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:47,239
hey look I got these seeds that I've

1177
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,160
kind of played around with on my own and

1178
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:51,598
I can trade them for something else and

1179
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:53,000
I started trading with people um and

1180
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,240
that was probably the the very

1181
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,039
beginnings of just getting my hands on

1182
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,838
stuff

1183
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,960
now some of my favorite stuff from back

1184
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:03,639
then uh there was a a haze number one

1185
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,599
cross cut that came around or a flower

1186
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:07,519
that came around really heavily that was

1187
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,599
through one of my good buddies that was

1188
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:13,559
super unique um and really gave me like

1189
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,640
kind of the essence of what Haze was uh

1190
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,519
there's there's so little Haze these

1191
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:20,480
days that like it was it was one of

1192
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,400
those like perfect very typical samples

1193
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,960
um as far as stuff that I grew early on

1194
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,639
that I just absolutely loved uh I had a

1195
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,720
double purple Doge of Mental Floss from

1196
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:35,279
a cat called like Outlaw grower Outlaw

1197
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:38,679
breeder maybe um from the seed Bay days

1198
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,440
that I fell in love with uh deep chunk

1199
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:44,159
is one of the the first strains that

1200
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:47,119
like really hooked me got me into cush

1201
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,838
got me really into like heavy medicinal

1202
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,119
mercing heavy

1203
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:56,239
strains um and then I run a deep Congo

1204
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:59,519
which was another you know odd beautiful

1205
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,919
sativa indicia pairing it was a one that

1206
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:05,480
I got from from across from a friend

1207
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,519
online um but that just you know it was

1208
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,960
my first fouras into kind of digging

1209
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,599
into what's out there now it really

1210
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,920
wasn't

1211
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:19,160
until you know probably 2010 and later

1212
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:22,119
that I really had a a super access to

1213
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:24,519
just anything you know and really got a

1214
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,720
full Taste of everything that was out

1215
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:30,358
there you know spending years in

1216
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,078
Colorado um just with access to every

1217
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:34,920
dispensary and everything you could have

1218
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,280
access to working in you know tons of

1219
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,079
commercial facilities running most of

1220
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,480
the gear that they ran you know when you

1221
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,599
work in a facility Cuts tend to make it

1222
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,480
into everybody's grow so you're all

1223
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:50,240
growing whatever you know whatever the

1224
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,760
grow grows um and so through that man I

1225
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,919
had finally access to just all of the

1226
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:58,559
flavors and it was literally like a kid

1227
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,159
in a c candy store because I finally had

1228
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,839
for so many years it was just whatever

1229
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,798
came bought you know you might get weed

1230
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:06,519
from your buddy or he might have two

1231
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:08,239
different kinds if you were like me you

1232
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:09,960
were on tour you might rent into four or

1233
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,919
five people with a couple but it was

1234
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,920
kind of uncommon to get a

1235
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,240
selection you know to get eight or 10

1236
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,159
different kinds of weed and all of them

1237
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,358
be

1238
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,279
unique and it wasn't really until I

1239
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,519
started growing my own heavily and and

1240
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,640
getting access to seeds and and just

1241
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,199
popping whatever I could get my hands on

1242
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,960
that I finally got to that point where

1243
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:34,480
I'm like I still don't think I know

1244
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,280
everything that's there but I have a

1245
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:41,880
much better understanding now of of the

1246
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,319
possibilities you know because so many

1247
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,240
of those earlier strains like I said

1248
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:47,960
were so one note that now we're seeing

1249
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,679
these beautiful combinations of

1250
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,880
different things and different flavors

1251
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:55,598
in different ways it it's just

1252
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,680
unprecedented um so when did the switch

1253
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,960
occur

1254
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:03,838
between growing and deciding I'm going

1255
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,838
to breed my first

1256
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:11,880
plant it wasn't they weren't far behind

1257
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:15,519
but back then it was purely

1258
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,960
necessity like it wasn't with the air of

1259
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,159
I'm GNA one day be selling seeds I you

1260
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,280
know I wish I had that sort of

1261
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:26,960
foresight because it really it wasn't

1262
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:30,079
until maybe 25 15

1263
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,000
2016 that I really went at breeding as a

1264
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,519
full-time thing and as a as a passion

1265
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,239
and is something that you know I wanted

1266
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:38,280
to work on

1267
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,959
wholeheartedly um I'd always just been a

1268
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,119
grower and I bred in little small

1269
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,199
projects on my own largely because like

1270
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:47,480
I said it was two strains that I loved

1271
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:49,719
or it was something I knew I was going

1272
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,559
to lose for some reason or couldn't keep

1273
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:54,039
up with had to shut a grow you know

1274
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:57,359
whatever the the situation was and so it

1275
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:59,239
was back then it was more more of just a

1276
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:02,480
necessity I didn't have access to all

1277
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,519
the genetics that I have access to today

1278
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,798
um and so it was just kind of one of

1279
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,280
those things where if I had two strains

1280
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:11,519
that I loved I'd breed them together so

1281
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,400
that I you know I had something and when

1282
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:17,199
I started breeding full-time I had some

1283
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,880
of these projects that I had worked on

1284
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:23,480
but to be honest it wasn't ever at that

1285
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,200
point with an eye towards I have a goal

1286
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,440
like I want to breed a strain with

1287
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,318
flavor or I have a you know it was

1288
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,119
almost always just two strains I love

1289
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,318
both these strains I want to make

1290
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:36,599
another strain that's you know across of

1291
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,838
these and keep them around or if I had

1292
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:43,359
access to F1 you know enough seeds I'd

1293
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:45,400
do an F2 um but yeah back then

1294
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:47,159
especially when it was just you know

1295
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,039
stuff that I had gotten off of forums or

1296
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:53,358
stuff that I had worked with um just

1297
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:56,199
here and there those were just I wanted

1298
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:59,279
to try other stuff you know because I

1299
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:02,078
didn't have this great access I mean I'm

1300
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,720
from the the East Coast we had whatever

1301
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,079
came by you know we generally lived in a

1302
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,078
bubble and didn't really have

1303
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,920
until you know like I said maybe the

1304
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,400
early 2000s finally had access to just

1305
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,358
other stuff that we could get maybe know

1306
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,079
a buddy that had a cut um I ran a couple

1307
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,920
of I got I got spider mites twice for

1308
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,680
the same Purple Kush cut I gotta be

1309
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,039
honest with you man I'd fight again to

1310
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,159
get her back like it's one of the few

1311
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:33,440
that like got away that I don't know if

1312
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:36,440
I've seen in the exact same condition

1313
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,559
since the last time I saw her and I'll

1314
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,200
see if I can get you one that kid gave

1315
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,880
me mites twice and I knew I knew the

1316
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,558
second time I was gonna get him and I

1317
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,880
was like I gotta I gotta have it I gotta

1318
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:53,599
have it I uh my well I everybody knows I

1319
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,318
grow up a farm kid uh but not a lot of

1320
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,798
people know I also grew up up uh you

1321
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,639
know involved in a motorcycle Community

1322
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:05,239
I'll say won't shout out names

1323
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:08,798
um but I still know a group of bikers to

1324
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:10,879
this day that have the purple cush and

1325
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,440
like because it had unmistakable leaves

1326
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,920
right like that was a defining trait of

1327
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,039
it and one day one of them came or he

1328
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,960
just grew plants you know he got clones

1329
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,720
every year from his buddies and he just

1330
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,480
grew them out that's all he did and uh

1331
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:27,679
he goes can you come over over here and

1332
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,838
kind of like show me how you're he he

1333
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,558
want he was an old school grower that

1334
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:34,038
never really done anything like I said

1335
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,000
just water his plants uh but he saw some

1336
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:37,440
of the things that I was doing he's like

1337
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,639
can you come over and kind of show me

1338
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,240
how to like strip them and like

1339
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:43,679
defoliate them a little bit where I'm

1340
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:47,318
going to get my bud production where I

1341
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:49,159
want it to be like yeah absolutely man

1342
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:52,079
and he started shouting out some

1343
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:53,920
different stuff you know and this a few

1344
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,400
years ago so there was like some jack

1345
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,760
crosses

1346
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,599
um I don't remember all what he had but

1347
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,359
it wasn't all like super old stuff and

1348
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:04,160
then right at the end of his garden he

1349
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:06,199
goes oh and I got a purple cush over

1350
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:09,358
here and I was even being a smart ass

1351
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:12,719
then and I was like yeah we'll see you

1352
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:14,880
know like we'll we'll see and I walk

1353
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,919
over the Clone and I see it and I see

1354
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,440
that long middle leaf that slender

1355
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,400
pointed shape and I was like that's

1356
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,039
[ __ ] purple cush and he's like well I

1357
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,920
hope so my guys have been [ __ ]

1358
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,319
growing this for like how many decades

1359
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,358
now I'm like holy [ __ ] dude I haven't

1360
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:34,358
seen the first time I got that I grew it

1361
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:37,199
one time oh wow out in a greenhouse and

1362
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:39,119
it was just strictly production and I

1363
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,279
fell in love with it but I fell in love

1364
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,480
with it afterwards I like the plant as

1365
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,359
is it's not a commercial producer like

1366
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,960
it's not one that you're just gonna you

1367
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:51,318
know grow shitloads of weed of but it's

1368
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,318
it's very typical and it's one of those

1369
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:56,079
that when you see it you know it I miss

1370
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:58,318
her so much it's the only one away

1371
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,839
that's the only one like people ask me

1372
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:03,199
all the time about like what strain of

1373
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:04,480
all the strains that you had what strain

1374
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,598
would you you know is there one you

1375
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,519
always wanted or it's probably that one

1376
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,480
she never came

1377
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:15,079
back oh I'll see if I can get a hold of

1378
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,039
that one yeah and uh I'll I'll keep you

1379
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:20,640
in the loop with it magician wants to

1380
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:22,400
know why don't you have pictures of your

1381
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:27,920
stuff on your

1382
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:29,720
website so we have been

1383
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,440
through

1384
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:37,239
uh three PayPal accounts two venmo

1385
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,720
accounts a cash app account and three

1386
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:41,318
credit card

1387
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:43,318
processors okay anybody that's tried to

1388
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:45,759
get a credit card processor in the last

1389
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,880
couple of years will tell you that the

1390
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,799
few that are legitimate credit card

1391
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,720
processors that will even have a

1392
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:59,079
conversation with you if you're a seed

1393
00:58:53,719 --> 00:59:00,358
vendor are very particular about what

1394
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:02,798
you can

1395
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:04,598
put um so what we originally were're

1396
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:07,639
going to do was put pictures of all the

1397
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:10,519
strains put descriptions put you know if

1398
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:12,920
we could get THC contents and stuff like

1399
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:15,838
that and so when we signed up for this

1400
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,519
most recent credit card processor we had

1401
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:20,440
to go through the underwriting process

1402
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:23,480
which is normal of any proper banking

1403
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,880
situation and they were pretty much like

1404
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:30,119
look the less info you put on there the

1405
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:34,920
better and nothing about like THC

1406
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:37,119
percentages content Turing profiles so

1407
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,519
what we're working on doing and once

1408
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,720
again anybody that's followed me for a

1409
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:44,000
while now knows I'm on my fourth

1410
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:47,038
Instagram page I've lost about 60,000

1411
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,318
followers um I've probably lost 15,000

1412
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:52,799
pictures of my of my strings um I put

1413
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:54,880
eight years into my first page and it

1414
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,440
got shut down with 30,000 followers

1415
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,240
broke my heart but what we decided to do

1416
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:03,079
was to start redistributing all of our

1417
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,719
advertising of of all kinds so now what

1418
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:08,960
I'm doing is all the weed pictures are

1419
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:12,399
on my subreddit which is RT F genetics

1420
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,240
um what I do still have is there and as

1421
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,519
I get more pictures we're leaving them

1422
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:19,000
there now instead of Instagram so that

1423
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:21,798
when they get taken down I don't lose

1424
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,679
years of my work you know that's my

1425
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:25,679
fault you know it's my fault like when

1426
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,558
you do everything when you do it all

1427
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,000
yourself you kind of get into this like

1428
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:31,480
it's easier to just have one social

1429
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,838
media page so I can just oh so I can

1430
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,159
just do everything you know in one place

1431
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,000
and I don't necessarily have to have six

1432
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:39,920
different pages you know it's like you

1433
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,880
said with Discord there's a really

1434
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,280
healthy community on my Discord now um

1435
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,240
you know those guys share tons of

1436
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,359
pictures of my work um and for me I kind

1437
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:51,798
of am completely hands off with it in a

1438
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,558
sense that like I'm not over moderating

1439
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:55,318
it I'm not like telling people if you

1440
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:57,880
have a problem with my gear gear please

1441

go tell somebody like tell me you know

1442
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,200

1443
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,798

1445
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,960
through it I'll figure it out you know

1446
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:08,880
seeds are living things and it happens

1447
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,358
but um the reason I don't have any

1448
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,200
pictures on my Instagram page now is

1449
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:17,078
because I'm tired of getting them shut

1450
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:19,000
down um I'm really kind of sick of it um

1451
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:21,760
and so I'm not putting any more weed

1452
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,920
pictures on Instagram for the time being

1453
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,440
until we can figure out how they can

1454
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,280
stay there

1455
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,798
um yeah how about on your Discord oh

1456
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,079
Discord yeah Discord anything goes there

1457
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:35,440
I mean that's one of those things that

1458
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:38,280
like I I need to start getting more

1459
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,318
active in like posting there but I also

1460
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,720
don't want it to be one of those thing

1461
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,599
I'm really weird about the

1462
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:46,078
self-promotion [ __ ] man and maybe I'm

1463
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,318
just old school I I kind of joke that as

1464
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,079
soon as they're dead air I start

1465
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:51,639
plugging but like that's something I had

1466
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:53,920
to teach myself to do it's not something

1467
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:56,000
that like comes supernaturally to me of

1468
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,559
like I just need to I want everybody to

1469
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,599
see everything I'm doing 247 so it's

1470
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,640
like once I get into a habit of this is

1471
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:04,318
where I'm sharing weed pictures man I

1472
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,679
forget there's six other places I need

1473
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,880
to go post that same picture you know

1474
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:12,798
right that's kind of tough man like I do

1475
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:15,798
have other things going on like I I do

1476
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:18,119
weed my day but like I do try to have

1477
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:21,038
some semblance of a life as well and so

1478
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:24,039
it's like one day I'll pay somebody to

1479
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:27,079
handle all of that social media YouTube

1480
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:28,400
run my podcast like we're just not there

1481
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:30,920
yet you know a lot of us are

1482
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,318
bootstrapping our our our our our

1483
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,920
businesses and a lot of us started with

1484
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:38,159
absolutely nothing and have built names

1485
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,440
and brands that people recognize to some

1486
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:44,639
degree and that just comes from being

1487
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:48,440
persistent um I've put hundreds how long

1488
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:53,118
have you been public with turine

1489
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:57,720
genetics 17 I'm sorry 16

1490
01:02:53,119 --> 01:03:01,079
2016 t genetics yeah 2016 was when it

1491
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:02,879
became like fulltime yeah yeah and that

1492
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:05,039
was after a few years of in the

1493
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,519
commercial industry doing a little bit

1494
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:10,480
of everything I want to I won the first

1495
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,639
ever rosin competition with a with a

1496
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,960
hash company um you know I I worked in a

1497
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:18,358
bunch of large commercial grows did it

1498
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:22,358
on my own for 18 years on the other side

1499
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:23,639
of the law um and that was really 2015

1500
01:03:22,358 --> 01:03:25,639
was probably the beginning of me

1501
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:28,118
starting a social media page the

1502
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:31,400
original t fiend page that's now long

1503
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:33,760
defunct and reset um and I did that

1504
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,599
until 2020 when they shut the first one

1505
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,400
down so it was like six years or

1506
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,480
something like that that I had built

1507
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:43,440
that first page um and then after that

1508
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,920
like I started doing the growcast uh

1509
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,039
Jordan is an absolutely awesome dude um

1510
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,159
he was one of those people that like

1511
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,240
when they shut down my Instagram leveled

1512
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:55,519
with me and was like you shouldn't have

1513
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:58,679
relied on them so heav heavily don't do

1514
01:03:55,519 --> 01:04:01,239
it again it wasn't like that but that

1515
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:03,118
was exactly the point was he he was

1516
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:05,318
essentially saying like get a website

1517
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,318
diversify make sure you've got you know

1518
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:08,679
all this the other thing back to the

1519
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:10,960
original question now I remember what

1520
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:14,679
started all this we are also trying to

1521
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,679
get my strains put up onto seedfinder um

1522
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:20,318
we we just did a huge batch of them um I

1523
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:22,759
have a few strains at this point so

1524
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:26,159
getting them all logged in and and all

1525
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,920
of that into seedfinder has been a chore

1526
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:31,159
the goal is eventually to have that be

1527
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:35,159
more of a repository for the actual data

1528
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:36,679
of like photos and tarpine cannaboid

1529
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:38,239
percentages and whatever other

1530
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:41,038
extemporaneous data we could put

1531
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,239
together um but once again man it's

1532
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,640
being a Onan show it's like my wife

1533
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:47,278
helps me a lot and it's the two of us

1534
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:49,038
but that's you know I don't I don't have

1535
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:51,559
a team I don't have a bunch of people

1536
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,880
that do things you know we knock out

1537
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:55,119
everything that has to get done and it's

1538
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,400
one of of those things that it's a

1539
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,119
passion for me I love what I do if I

1540
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,240
didn't I probably would have given up

1541
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:04,960
ages ago because there's there's so much

1542
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,719
that's not dealing with plants in this

1543
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,119
business that is the tough part like if

1544
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:13,959
my worst problem in a day is plant

1545
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:16,358
related it was a good day but you know

1546
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,920
most most days it's dealing with

1547
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:20,598
somebody who's pissed off or somebody

1548
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,278
who's angry about something or you know

1549
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:24,798
and it's it's one of those things that

1550
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:26,519
that's the part of the business that I

1551
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:30,159
understand why so many breeders dump

1552
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:31,519
their gear onto seed banks and just say

1553
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,480
I'm not going to handle it I'm not going

1554
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:36,838
to deal with it I don't care so the

1555
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,719
Breeders that go above and beyond to

1556
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,440
have that connection with their their

1557
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,639
their the people that are growing their

1558
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,480
strains not only is it rare but those

1559
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,000
are the ones that you should support

1560
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,039
because those are the people that love

1561
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,639
what they do they're not just a face a

1562
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,480
brand with no face you know it's not

1563
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:55,639
just a marketing team that's running it

1564
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,358
all it's somebody who loves what they do

1565
01:05:55,639 --> 01:06:00,239
and who's passionate about what they're

1566
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:02,880
producing and nine times out of

1567
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,798
10 these social media companies don't

1568
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,720
want us advertising without paying them

1569
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:10,559
large amounts of advertising money so

1570
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:13,278
that's really the big difference between

1571
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,359
you know your big Brands and you or I is

1572
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:16,880
that they probably have a $10,000 a

1573
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:20,000
month marketing budget that they're

1574
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,278
putting straight into Instagram's

1575
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,838
Pockets whereas if you're not paying

1576
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:27,599
them ad Revenue they look at it as a

1577
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:31,278
burden that you're making money without

1578
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,838
giving them their Fair cut I guess you

1579
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:36,719
know I remember you saying you had a was

1580
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,759
it sorbet I just dropped a sorbet line

1581
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,919
we just did another sorbet line it'll be

1582
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,200
the last one I'm working with this line

1583
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,480
um eventually I'm going to go back and

1584
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:47,358
work with some more of the original f1s

1585
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,480
and just see what else is in that line

1586
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:52,038
um the sorbet line that I've had now has

1587
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:55,719
been worked with by a handful of other

1588
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:57,480
breeders it wasn't mine excuse me it was

1589
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:59,199
an effici and auto strain I found and

1590
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,039
worked with I don't see him working with

1591
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,798
it heavy we've worked with it a lot um

1592
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:05,760
you know Leo's told a few people that

1593
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:07,278
the cut that we worked with was better

1594
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,319
than anything he had ever seen from

1595
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:13,119
those um I know mantis worked with it at

1596
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:16,480
some point um Leap Frog genetics has

1597
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:18,400
worked with it a bunch um and so it's I

1598
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,920
did I did what I needed with it um I

1599
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,240
want to go back and see what else is

1600
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,240
there but my next

1601
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,078
line I've noticed that you know once

1602
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:30,558
again in these conversations that we're

1603
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:32,079
having somewhat repeatedly I don't have

1604
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,720
enough

1605
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:37,440
pooping so we're going to go back and

1606
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:39,399
we're going to dig in some just some

1607
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,278
rancid

1608
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,358
rotten just poop and we're g to see what

1609
01:07:42,278 --> 01:07:48,400
we can find um you know I hear the

1610
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,239
people when they speak I will say that

1611
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,920
um I I've never been one of those people

1612
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,318
that you know isn't a part of the

1613
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,400
community I I talk to Growers all day

1614
01:07:54,318 --> 01:08:00,119
long um anybody that has a question a

1615
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,440
grow question a breeding question

1616
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,760
whether it's about my genetics or

1617
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,400
otherwise I try to answer them all

1618
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,559
because I remember being a young cat who

1619
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,760
didn't have access to you know the

1620
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,680
resources that we have today or being

1621
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,559
overwhelmed with the information that

1622
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:16,559
was out there and not having anybody

1623
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,319
that I trusted that I could go hey man

1624
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,239
how does this work like what's your you

1625
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,920
know what's your what's your opinion and

1626
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:24,479
so I answer all of those I answer every

1627
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,920
question I can

1628
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,559
and I hear people I hear you know we

1629
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,719
don't have these conversations in a

1630
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,839
vacuum like I hear you talking people

1631
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:38,880
want nasty funky poopy gassy you know I

1632
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:41,759
hear it and I have a problem with like I

1633
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:45,440
I will I have a tendency to run fruity

1634
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:49,279
profiles just because I find that like

1635
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,079
as far as the diversity in that I I

1636
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,440
found there's there's just so much there

1637
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:56,318
of like the different ways that kind of

1638
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:59,639
mimic mix other fruity profiles that we

1639
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,560
associate with but yet in its complexity

1640
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,960
of how it you know it can taste it it

1641
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,159
can a single strain can smell like five

1642
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:08,399
or six different things and you just go

1643
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,158
yeah that's you know um and I find in

1644
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,358
the fruity kind of category there's a

1645
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,719
lot just to dig there but you know I

1646
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,199
definitely listen to people and when

1647
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:20,960
they say like we want the funk I'm

1648
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:23,119
like we got to have that funk then let's

1649
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,640
find it you know like let's see what we

1650
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:28,119
can do let's I wish I had that on my

1651
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,920
soundboard right now you know let's dig

1652
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:32,278
let's dig in there and see what we can

1653
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,319
find and I'll meet you on the I'll meet

1654
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:38,199
you in the support group I guess you

1655
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:39,520
know hell yeah yeah so next it's poopin

1656
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:42,039
um

1657
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,000
fiveyear man that really to me I want to

1658
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:46,798
hear more about the sorbet line okay

1659
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
yeah the sorbet line what's funny about

1660
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,359
the sorbet right from the minute I

1661
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,119
started working with it everybody that

1662
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,239
messed with any of the f1s mess with any

1663
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,559
of the f2s any of the crosses that we

1664
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,759
did of it has told me it's one of the

1665
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,679
most

1666
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,600
complex strains they've ever worked with

1667
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,840
and when when I first ran

1668
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:12,960
theal um so it's

1669
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,360
got It's I named one of the one of the

1670
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,560
crosses that I did with the storb I

1671
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:18,079
named nog Champa right everybody asked

1672
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,760
me does it smell like the

1673
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:24,960
incense no but it reminds me there is a

1674
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,119
lot of incense there like incense kind

1675
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,198
of turbs but the thing that I love about

1676
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,880
it is it's so

1677
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:34,319
complex that it reminds you of incense

1678
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:37,000
in that there's so much going on but you

1679
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:39,679
can't almost can't point to say like it

1680
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,279
reminds me of that right so it's one of

1681
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,319
those strains that the more you smoke it

1682
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,880
you just want to hit it again just so

1683
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:47,719
you can pull that flavor and try and put

1684
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,920
it together of what that note is that

1685
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:51,920
you're tasting so the pineapple sorbet

1686
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,760
that I originally worked with it has a

1687
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:59,359
lot of candy pineapple but it has this

1688
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,760
like incense on the beach type of thing

1689
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,759
where you almost get like a

1690
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,039
coconuty uh lots of fruit you know like

1691
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,000
just assorted fruit type of thing but

1692
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:11,719
it's also got this I always say it

1693
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,760
reminds me of like rum punches on the

1694
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:17,840
beach you know all of the tropical that

1695
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:20,239
just goes with that it's just a level of

1696
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,640
unique that I you know I had to work

1697
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:25,039
with it and so the thing that I found is

1698
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,079
that anything you hit with it kind of

1699
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:31,600
takes this even amount of this overly

1700
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:34,319
complex fruity in sensey thing and then

1701
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,719
kind of marries that with the weird so

1702
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:37,000
that's kind of like with the with the

1703
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:39,560
pineapple meatball that somebody was

1704
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,198
asking about earlier you know I never

1705
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:45,360
thought meat breath and pineapple sorbet

1706
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,759
would work like when I put it together

1707
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:47,479
it was one of those strains that I was

1708
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,560
just

1709
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:52,238
like this is weird but I'm going to

1710
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,080
throw it and see how it happens you know

1711
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,759
and it's been one of the top

1712
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:59,559
four strains of mine that people have

1713
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:02,400
resonated with the most like it it

1714
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:05,080
washes well it's it's a hasher the

1715
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,479
profile is super strange and unique you

1716
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:11,279
know it's just it's a it's a box

1717
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:13,439
Checker that sounds delicious uh So

1718
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,559
speaking of growing your genetics I said

1719
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,519
I hadn't grown your genetics yet but I

1720
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,280
had wanted to for a couple years now

1721
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,520
I've been watching it I just you know

1722
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:25,599
I've had so much [ __ ] going on I really

1723
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:28,480
haven't had the opportunity um but you

1724
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:31,079
mentioned Lee frog genetics earlier

1725
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:33,439
they're both good friends of mine um and

1726
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:38,158
they sent me a bunch of seeds that they

1727
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:39,359
did from your work of that Champa Rose

1728
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:41,319
that's one of the ones that I really

1729
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:44,000
wanted to grow out see what they were

1730
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:46,000
doing it looked really really good um

1731
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and then the other one that I didn't

1732
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,920
have seeds of was the orange Head

1733
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,319
Rush do you still do those yeah so I'm

1734
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,039
going to get back to the that's those

1735
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,479
ended up being some of the heaviest

1736
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:03,880
yielding strains that I've made those uh

1737
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:05,279
the 501st OG deep chunk the ones I

1738
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,920
called The Head Rush those are actually

1739
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:10,479
from eclectic Elegance seeds and I think

1740
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,319
he ended up what's funny was I wor he he

1741
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:13,718
gave me those way back when I asked him

1742
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:16,238
if I could work with him I made some

1743
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:17,800
seeds of my own and just one of those

1744
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,759
where I put some stuff together I needed

1745
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:23,800
a name so then later down the road he

1746
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,800
does his own thing with them um and and

1747
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:29,400
probably still sells them amazing seeds

1748
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,079
um but those ended up being some of the

1749
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:33,599
chunkiest crosses that I worked with

1750
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:36,319
like out of everything that I've worked

1751
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,880
with so far um and so yeah I'm going to

1752
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:41,399
get back to that I always joke that like

1753
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:44,000
my goal has always been to get people to

1754
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:47,559
smoke more Kush so like if you kind of

1755
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,880
look at through 80 85% of the work that

1756
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,920
I've done there's kind of a prevailing

1757
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,520
theme and it's just if I could get

1758
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:57,119
people to smoke more Mercy Kush ween

1759
01:13:54,520 --> 01:14:00,040
heavy Kush I think we'd all get a little

1760
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:02,198
higher um that now the counter to that

1761
01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:04,000
is that most of the poopin I feel like

1762
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:06,638
most of the heavy pooping most of the

1763
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,238
funkiest profiles tend to be Southeast

1764
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:12,760
Asian in origin um tend to be kind of

1765
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,718
more sativa leaning strains not to say

1766
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,560
there's not that in the you know in the

1767
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,319
in the indicia profiles as well but I

1768
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,039
feel like a lot of what we associate

1769
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,479
with these days is like the GMOs and the

1770
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:26,158
chem 4S and the you know the really

1771
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:27,839
stinky stinky stuff a lot of those are

1772
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:30,238
Southeast Asian strains they're mostly

1773
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,400
sativa strains so why they take 11 and a

1774
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,799
half weeks and they're still not done

1775
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:37,079
you know it's why at 11 weeks they're

1776
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,840
really starting to put on their true

1777
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:41,479
show you know like they're just not

1778
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,800
strains that not great strains to grow

1779
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:46,238
indoors you know most of them will have

1780
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,719
some hermaphroditic Tendencies if you if

1781
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,599
you stress them a little much you know

1782
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,960
but that's where we get all those like

1783
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,840
awesome stinky yucky profiles from you

1784
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,520
know is Those Old School Ties those old

1785
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,199
school Vietnamese

1786
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,360
strains uh the Cambodian you know

1787
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:07,439
there's southeast Asia effect for me

1788
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:09,880
yeah no absolutely absolutely those

1789
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:12,119
trins are devastating too like they are

1790
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,239
really heavy but for somebody who

1791
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:15,920
doesn't have a super tolerance like

1792
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,599
there's a little bit of like they can be

1793
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:22,480
overwhelming oh yeah [ __ ] put you on

1794
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,360
your ass um but I that's what really got

1795
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,000
me and then why I shouted out the

1796
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:28,319
Breeders that I did I'm interested in

1797
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,079
working with some of your gear uh I do

1798
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:33,439
work with Dynasty I even work with solo

1799
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:37,439
uh and solo does a lot of you know like

1800
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:40,439
modern short week heavy TP stuff um but

1801
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:43,439
I think it's important to take these

1802
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:45,638
This Modern cannabis that we have now

1803
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:49,000
and for the people that are willing to

1804
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:51,279
do the work to go back to those you know

1805
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
old ties and stuff like that and find

1806
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,960
that one that's stable find that one

1807
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,960
that as unique which might be one in

1808
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:00,399
1,000 you know uh but still taking the

1809
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,399
time to do that and work it back into

1810
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:05,920
modern medicine so we can kind of open

1811
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,279
up that that genetic profile again yeah

1812
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,600
one of the problems that we're having

1813
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:12,238
right now with that with the numbers

1814
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,920
game there um I don't know how many

1815
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:17,359
people I could tell you said man I found

1816
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:19,440
these my dad my dad gave me these strain

1817
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,000
these seeds my dad gave me these seeds

1818
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:24,439
I'm going to start a skunk project I'm

1819
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
about to pop all he gave me bags of them

1820
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:27,439
I'm going to start a skunk project we're

1821
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,679
going to resurrect

1822
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:35,559
skunk right then everybody runs into the

1823
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:38,279
same problem seeds that are older than

1824
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:42,600
95 are probably going to have less than

1825
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:44,759
a 1% germ rate if that right if you're

1826
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,600
talking about strains that are 20 seeds

1827
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,679
that are 20 plus years

1828
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:52,440
old other thing is the 70s specifically

1829
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:54,639
70s 80s where a lot of those strains

1830
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:57,759
those old School strains that people

1831
01:16:54,639 --> 01:17:01,520
remember right the skunk and the you

1832
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:06,159
know the original lineages of those that

1833
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:08,480
was a long time ago that was a long time

1834
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:11,479
ago so unless somebody's sitting on cuts

1835
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:15,599
of that any seeds that might be from

1836
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:18,879
that era are long since worthless so we

1837
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:22,520
really get into like a if you're talking

1838
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,880
about bringing stuff back from old stuff

1839
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,000
you better have hundreds of thousands of

1840
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,199
seeds to be able to start with so you

1841
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,119
can just get a couple of plants that

1842
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:34,158
work you know but if we're talking about

1843
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:36,000
something where people are going and

1844
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:38,279
finding land race genetics and finding

1845
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,520
these you know small untouched areas

1846
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:44,039
where there's or or lineage you know uh

1847
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,600
Legacy genetics where people have

1848
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,920
actually been breeding these particular

1849
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,480
strains and they're not overly

1850
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,880
hybridized with American stuff or Dutch

1851
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:55,959
stuff you know that's what we need

1852
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:59,359
like we need to grab as much of that as

1853
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:01,279
we have access to as the community and

1854
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:05,198
just so that that's the sort of stuff we

1855
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:08,158
can still be infusing in once inevitably

1856
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:10,039
modern genetics get all over the planet

1857
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:11,679
there's still only a few places in the

1858
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:15,639
world where you can find seeds that

1859
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:18,199
aren't just you know Dutch Old Dutch

1860
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:20,920
strains or that aren't just you know

1861
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:22,319
modern American strains and that's you

1862
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,239
know that's the beautiful part about

1863
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,399
those people that still going out there

1864
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:28,959
still hunting stuff down in these little

1865
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:31,719
pockets of the world because that's

1866
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,800
where the I don't know is going to come

1867
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:35,639
from it's not going to be from overly

1868
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,880
banging together stuff we already know

1869
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:40,119
what it does it's going to be going back

1870
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,520
now that we have the analytics now that

1871
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:45,238
we have the capabilities to do testing

1872
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:48,520
to go back and find in these you know

1873
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:52,119
somewhat older genetics Old World style

1874
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,920
genetics not old seeds um that we're

1875
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:56,039
finally going to see you know what else

1876
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,920
is out there that we don't know about

1877
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:01,198
yet so we got you gave us a bunch of

1878
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:03,319
seeds uh to give away to our patreon

1879
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,519
members we're going to be doing an

1880
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:07,519
episode of do or dab tomorrow I don't

1881
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,400
know if you have any time but if you

1882
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,920
want to come in and see your seeds be

1883
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:14,158
given away during a game show H it's a

1884
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:17,199
lot of fun we have two new members

1885
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:19,439
coming on right on and taco with axe to

1886
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:22,279
go head-to-head on do or dab which is

1887
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:25,359
like a game where we have two players

1888
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:28,319
that go through a game board uh random

1889
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:31,399
selection style they get a number it

1890
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:33,960
comes up it might say do a one G dab it

1891
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:36,479
might sing say something like sing

1892
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,880
Bohemian rap city for 30 second you just

1893
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,198
never know right um so they get

1894
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,079
questions like this and they go

1895
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:44,638
head-to-head at the end of the game

1896
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:47,399
everybody's super high everybody had a

1897
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:49,520
great time and the winner gets to pick

1898
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:52,519
uh a pack of seeds from you while the

1899
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,560
other one gets a random pack cool yeah

1900
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,520
absolutely absolutely man yeah uh what

1901
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,880
time that's going to be about the same

1902
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,679
time about 5:00 P PM okay because I got

1903
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,159
a 9: tomorrow we're doing another I got

1904
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:06,319
a podcast tomorrow evening at 9: uh we

1905
01:20:03,158 --> 01:20:08,198
do two and as much as I hate Instagram

1906
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,000
at this point I'm just it's where my

1907
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:12,960
following is at the moment yeah I'm

1908
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,800
doing two podcasts a week uh we do dank

1909
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,600
talk on Wednesdays with me and the real

1910
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:20,560
Mac Blunts and then on Saturdays I do

1911
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,239
the OG sesh um which is usually just me

1912
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,840
and another it's it's this it's it's

1913
01:20:23,238 --> 01:20:27,638
usually me and another grower another

1914
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,600
breeder and we just in an hour we s sit

1915
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:31,079
and we shoot the [ __ ] off the cuff and

1916
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,199
it's all off the top of the head and

1917
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:35,639
it's really just the conversations that

1918
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:38,238
so many of us have when it's just us

1919
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:41,119
Growers or just us breeders or you know

1920
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:44,198
the industry people and your average

1921
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:46,000
listener probably doesn't hear so much

1922
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:47,559
of this kind of stuff where these are

1923
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,039
the kind of just conversations that we

1924
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,199
have so often when we're just sitting

1925
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:53,039
around and just you know puffing whether

1926
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,519
it's about grow Styles or or whether

1927
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:58,000
it's about you know it's the life it's

1928
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,960
just there's so much that I love about

1929
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,719
what I do so I don't ever think that

1930
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,880
it's 90% of my day is just talking weed

1931
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,600
with people and then I just figured I

1932
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,719
might as well stick a camera in my face

1933
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,440
and and you know let somebody else

1934
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:14,039
listen to it because it works you know

1935
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,678
what I love about it is I always enjoyed

1936
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:18,079
getting with the homies sitting on the

1937
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:21,480
couch smoking weed letting the

1938
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:24,039
conversation go wherever it goes um and

1939
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:26,599
now with you know all of this technology

1940
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:28,760
that we're using right now to connect

1941
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,440
with people all over the world that do

1942
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,079
all these different niches within the

1943
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:37,559
Canabis Community I get no more pleasure

1944
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:39,399
than getting to meet new faces um and

1945
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:43,080
find out those people that I Vibe with

1946
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:46,759
it's [ __ ] cool man like a

1947
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:49,840
gigantic constant going cannabis event

1948
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,560
yeah like speed dating it's even better

1949
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,719
because so many of the Cannabis events

1950
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,440
have either gotten shut down or wrapped

1951
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,840
up they're not what they were we don't

1952
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,439
even even have Seattle hempest they were

1953
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,880
talking about doing it this year and if

1954
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:04,198
you go on the that was the biggest event

1955
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,000
that was one of the biggest events in

1956
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:08,678
the United States you know Seattle

1957
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,119
hempest one of older ones too I want to

1958
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:14,239
say that like the the hash bash um and

1959
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:17,198
Ann Arbor I think were two of the ones I

1960
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,759
remember way back in the day raing about

1961
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:22,719
in High

1962
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:25,159
Times yeah but if you go on the website

1963
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:27,319
even this year it's like not confirmed

1964
01:22:25,158 --> 01:22:31,599
they were talking about doing the event

1965
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:34,519
and who knows you know yeah there was a

1966
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,719
long history there of Cups and them

1967
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,719
being really awesome and then there was

1968
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:41,920
a point a lot of it had to do with the

1969
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:44,039
the legalization end of it that when it

1970
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:47,039
was kind of in a gray area in some of

1971
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:48,960
these places then it was one thing but

1972
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,960
now that it's legal and everything needs

1973
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,600
to be within a very specific framework

1974
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,920
of yeah have to buy the weed and

1975
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,679
dispensaries and you can't just open

1976
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,560
smoke and all of a lot of things changed

1977
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:03,158
you know they quit doing the Denver cups

1978
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:06,039
on 420 like those were some of the

1979
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:09,439
biggest events on the planet I mean you

1980
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:12,519
would have 30,000 people a day by three

1981
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:16,158
days and it was just you know it was it

1982
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:18,320
was Open Season it was literally like we

1983
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,039
did a few Cali cups where you especially

1984
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:22,079
those couple chalice the first couple

1985
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:24,399
chales where you could just walk up and

1986
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:27,039
purchase slabs on people's tables you

1987
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:31,679
just walk up and buy pounds you know and

1988
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:34,679
it was that that all ended 15 16 and you

1989
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:37,719
just it's just not the same without the

1990
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:40,800
vendors and without being able to show

1991
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:44,158
off and bring whatever you want and you

1992
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,920
know it's yeah I really don't have the

1993
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:49,000
time like I used to to do shows anymore

1994
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,639
because I've got so much of my own stuff

1995
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,279
going on uh do you still participate in

1996
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:57,400
shows quite often

1997
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:59,840
n man I did a few I did a couple runs um

1998
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:03,119
man it just came down to a it's an

1999
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:05,239
expensive lifestyle B doesn't always pay

2000
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:08,760
off um

2001
01:24:05,238 --> 01:24:11,759
C once again I grew up on music

2002
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:15,159
lots and it's just a hold over it's the

2003
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:18,119
exact same same thing in a different

2004
01:24:15,158 --> 01:24:20,479
parking lot it's just people hustling in

2005
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:23,279
a parking lot and like I said now it's

2006
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:25,519
not quite as Open Season so whatever

2007
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:28,920
you're selling it's just not as easy to

2008
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:31,960
make as much money on them um I never

2009
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:34,039
really had a passion for the the weed

2010
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:35,960
circuit um there's some people that were

2011
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:37,760
just made for it and it was I always

2012
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,000
looked at it just like a concert if they

2013
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,960
weren't doing shows they would just be

2014
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,039
doing you know weed events and they

2015
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,639
would go to City to City to City to city

2016
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:51,118
and you'd see the same people on the lot

2017
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,359
every single time same people paid for

2018
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:56,279
the big booth same people are in the

2019
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:59,839
back like it was you know and it's all

2020
01:24:56,279 --> 01:25:01,399
politics it's all I don't know once

2021
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,560
again I got other things to do than

2022
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:05,920
travel around the country smoking weed I

2023
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,039
love it you know if I can drop into a

2024
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,840
cup every now and again it's still a fun

2025
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:14,279
time but it's I it hasn't there's just

2026
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:17,039
this era of like it's not the same you

2027
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:20,198
know a lot of it has changed there

2028
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:23,479
really is no big cups anymore like there

2029
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:25,198
used to be and so now so of it is like

2030
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:28,439
everybody's desperately trying to buy

2031
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:30,079
for the same amount of dollars whereas

2032
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:31,399
when you make your money online it's

2033
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,479
just how many people can you get in

2034
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:35,198
front of whereas if you're making your

2035
01:25:33,479 --> 01:25:38,039
money in a parking lot it's how many

2036
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:40,118
people showed up today you don't control

2037
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:42,439
that so there's a little bit of when you

2038
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:44,158
have to pay money to go do those shows

2039
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:46,319
you have to pay money for advertising

2040
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:48,359
you have to pay money for banners to pay

2041
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,279
money for entries if you're entering the

2042
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:56,399
cup you have to you know and it's

2043
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:58,800
just it stopped being fun or profitable

2044
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,599
and I think for a lot of people once

2045
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,000
they had access to the internet in a

2046
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,920
little bit better way so many people

2047
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,039
were hitting you know Instagram for a

2048
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,118
long time and just crushing it that yeah

2049
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:12,760
it didn't make sense to go

2050
01:26:10,118 --> 01:26:15,079
fly especially post pandemic how much

2051
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,400
flying are you trying to do like I you

2052
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:19,880
know you just want to spend your whole

2053
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:21,638
time in an airplane and in a hotel for

2054
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,840
not a whole lot of money yeah you could

2055
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:25,239
get a McDonald's job and make more money

2056
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,319
than you're going to make TN around the

2057
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:28,519
country and it's just it's a little bit

2058
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:31,599
of

2059
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:35,159
like I've always appreciated being the

2060
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:38,320
kind of breeder that like people find me

2061
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:40,759
and when they find me they love what

2062
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,960
they end up finding so it's not one of

2063
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,280
those things where you saw me in a

2064
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:46,079
magazine or you saw me at a hype event

2065
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:48,759
and then you got stuff home and then

2066
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:52,039
it's super expensive and then you run it

2067
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:53,960
and you kind of go I don't get it you

2068
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:56,238
know know like the people have always

2069
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,920
found me and despite the fact that

2070
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:01,118
Instagram keeps shutting us down it

2071
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:03,880
doesn't really affect much because now

2072
01:27:01,118 --> 01:27:06,238
we've spread out so much and the people

2073
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:08,520
that find us are almost always word of

2074
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:10,439
mouth it's almost always a friend of a

2075
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:13,600
friend told me you had something that

2076
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:15,879
was different than everybody else and

2077
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,000
like I said that's why I try to keep

2078
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,359
something for everybody I try to keep a

2079
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:25,158
a flavor for every palette but at the

2080
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:28,799
same time I'm my pickiest critic whether

2081
01:27:25,158 --> 01:27:32,039
it's my grow whether it's you know my

2082
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:36,440
seeds so if I see something and it

2083
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:39,359
impresses me I usually assume that's the

2084
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:41,479
that's the top and and generally

2085
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:43,719
speaking when I show that to other

2086
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:45,559
people regardless of it's my own work or

2087
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:48,679
something I'm running from somebody else

2088
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,800
if I usually say this is shocking try

2089
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:52,639
this and it's usually something that

2090
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,279
other people are going to pick up on and

2091
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,840
go yeah that's that's something special

2092
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:58,920
so a good one a good in a good for

2093
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,119
instance was the blackout truffle right

2094
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:04,158
so the blackout truffle was a cut that I

2095
01:28:01,118 --> 01:28:06,319
got from a dispensary I was working at

2096
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,599
and when I left the veg manager hit me

2097
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:09,399
up and was just like hey if there's

2098
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:13,280
anything you want let me know so we had

2099
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:15,519
this bio chem cut from 303 seeds it was

2100
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:18,559
a chem4 sensy

2101
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,800
star and it is probably one of the

2102
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,199
strongest single cuts that I've that

2103
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,840
I've worked with like it's tests high

2104
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:27,678
and it's got a ton of turps which is

2105
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,880
super rare and we crossed that to the

2106
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,880
white Cherry

2107
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:35,440
truffle and which is another chem heavy

2108
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:36,960
you know chem cross and it is it's just

2109
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:39,279
ABS that's the one that I've had people

2110
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:42,319
come to me and go my customers are

2111
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:45,000
scared of it and I'm like you need

2112
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:46,920
better customers but beside the point

2113
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,679
like it's it just I think people think

2114
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,639
it's a marketing thing but I've had

2115
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:53,399
multiple people come to me and be like

2116
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,560
it's too strong for me I can't like I

2117
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:59,079
can't run it I can't everybody that I

2118
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:02,520
give it to it's too much and it's one of

2119
01:28:59,079 --> 01:29:05,479
those that for me I've seen tests on it

2120
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:08,600
most tests of the Cross aren't in the 30

2121
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:11,959
range the mom was a dispensary cut so it

2122
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:14,800
regularly tested in the 30s at dispose

2123
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:18,198
like no problem um but the crosses have

2124
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:21,039
all been kind of high to mid 20s but

2125
01:29:18,198 --> 01:29:22,479
just lots of mercing and once again

2126
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:25,920
that's that kind of comp combination

2127
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:27,879
that just makes everybody knock out and

2128
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,039
it's it's almost like a cheat code mer

2129
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:33,880
heavy mering levels is almost like the

2130
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:35,319
cheat code to to high potency because

2131
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,560
most people can't tell the difference

2132
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:40,679
between high THC and something just

2133
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:43,880
makes them so body high they're ready to

2134
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:45,560
pass out like that's that's what high is

2135
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:49,679
to so many people right unless you just

2136
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:52,280
smoke sativas and and just literally wig

2137
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:54,039
out the that's generally when people go

2138
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:56,319
it was too strong for me it's almost

2139
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:59,198
always because it made them go to sleep

2140
01:29:56,319 --> 01:30:01,118
it knocked you just off your ass that

2141
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:04,079
tends to be those heavy mercing strains

2142
01:30:01,118 --> 01:30:06,639
whether they're super high THC or not

2143
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:11,118
out of everything that you've made what

2144
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:12,679
would you say would be the number one St

2145
01:30:11,118 --> 01:30:15,759
strain at this

2146
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:18,920
moment where if you were gone tomorrow

2147
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,280
you would want that to represent the

2148
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,118
work that you've done with cannabis

2149
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:26,079
blackout truffle blackout truffle for

2150
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:28,039
sure hands down yeah and I think there's

2151
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,238
strains and I think there's strains that

2152
01:30:28,039 --> 01:30:31,920
I've made that have been more popular

2153
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,118
like that other people would probably

2154
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,480
argue with me about like the NOG Champa

2155
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:38,759
is one that you know so many people have

2156
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:40,399
come and told me it's I tell people it's

2157
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,000
special and I think people think it's

2158
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:46,039
marketing hype um that would probably be

2159
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,319
the very close number to uh the NOG Chom

2160
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:51,840
is a special special plant but the

2161
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:54,719
blackout truffle for me is a level of

2162
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,920
medicinal that like it's that cut

2163
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,319
through plant it's that one that like

2164
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:01,960
when I got jars of everything around

2165
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:04,000
when I hit the blackout truffle and even

2166
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,639
if it's from a a friend who doesn't know

2167
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
what they're doing and they beat their

2168
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:10,279
plants up and they were struggle looking

2169
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,399
and they didn't get a good feed on it

2170
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:16,840
it's still the gorgeous one it's still

2171
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:20,439
the one that just Wows everybody for me

2172
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:22,440
it's the profile it's got everything

2173
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:24,960
that the chemline has

2174
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:28,118
right it's got a heavy mothball spoiled

2175
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:30,719
Thai food thing going on but it doesn't

2176
01:31:28,118 --> 01:31:33,238
take 11 weeks to finish it's almost

2177
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,520
always finished in like eight to 10

2178
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:38,359
weeks no

2179
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:39,960
problem um and it's heavy like it's like

2180
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:41,599
I said it's the one that I've had other

2181
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,639
people tell me their customers don't

2182
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,920
want because it's too strong I've had

2183
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:47,560
other Growers tell me they had to cut

2184
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:50,760
back on running it because it was just

2185
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:53,639
too much for them but like for me with

2186
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:56,400
tolerance issues it's it's the one that

2187
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:57,719
like if you ask me the desert island

2188
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:00,399
question because that's the other one

2189
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:02,639
that I get like on a lot on the you know

2190
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:04,719
when I'm talking to maybe non non-

2191
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,679
breeder people it's always the like

2192
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,760
what's your strain three strains that

2193
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:10,118
you live on a desert island with and

2194
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,039
that would have to be that would have to

2195
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:15,039
be number one for me because every time

2196
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:18,238
I have something else and I go back to

2197
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:20,679
that one it's the one that always works

2198
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,599
you know like I build tolerance really

2199
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:25,679
quickly to strain

2200
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:27,800
um most of them depending on T profiles

2201
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,480
and certain other things you know most

2202
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,440
of them I'll build a tolerance to within

2203
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:34,599
a couple days of just puffing it

2204
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:36,559
regularly but that's the one that like

2205
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:39,880
it just always kind of kicks you where

2206
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:41,880
you need it and it's like it's almost

2207
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:45,319
the one where you have to go it has a

2208
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:47,359
special place like I can't a little too

2209
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:50,198
much in the middle of the day will still

2210
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:53,880
get you you know like I might have to go

2211
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:55,439
have a lay down um yeah that that's

2212
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,840
that's that's that's the one that I

2213
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:00,238
think if you asked me the strin that I

2214
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,360
think represents you know my favorite of

2215
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:03,718
the work that I've done it would be the

2216
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,880
blackout trule but the NOG Tampa is a

2217
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:08,480
second is a close

2218
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:11,159
second what if I asked you the same

2219
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:15,399
question but about somebody's genetics

2220
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:18,599
other than your own oh that's a good

2221
01:33:15,399 --> 01:33:21,000
one ask me the question

2222
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,560
again what was the what was the whole of

2223
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,840
the question just so I'm specific if you

2224
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,719
were on a desert island you could only

2225
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,639
take one strain with you and it's not I

2226
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:34,760
got I got your own

2227
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,760
work gotta be somebody else's

2228
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:38,759
work man I got to go back to that purple

2229
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,920
cush cut

2230
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,280
man you know I got to go back to that

2231
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:45,880
purple kush just because it's the one

2232
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:49,118
that got away it's the one that I

2233
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:51,960
haven't had in so long and it's the one

2234
01:33:49,118 --> 01:33:53,639
of the you know once you have a strain

2235
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,840
like it's in your grow and you can run

2236
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:58,560
it as much as you want and you can fill

2237
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:02,079
jars up with it then it's easy to get

2238
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:05,000
over it real quick you know like the

2239
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:07,279
even the most amazing looking strains

2240
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,639
once I can grow it for myself and I can

2241
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:13,599
just fill a whole room of it if I want

2242
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:16,079
then it's kind of like I don't know you

2243
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,880
kind of get a little jaded on it right

2244
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,719
so it's like the stuff that I've had

2245
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,719
access to throughout my my history of

2246
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:24,600
growing

2247
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:26,960
is always the stuff that I'd be like if

2248
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,159
it just never came around again it'd be

2249
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,760
okay you know even the best stuff that

2250
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:34,000
I've ever grown or run at the end of the

2251
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,920
day you just kind of go man if I had

2252
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,880
jars of it at one point then you know

2253
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,960
there's other stuff out there but that

2254
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,600
the ones that got away the ones that you

2255
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,158
didn't really get as much as you wanted

2256
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,719
the ones that you didn't really get your

2257
01:34:45,158 --> 01:34:50,638
fill of you know you didn't get sick of

2258
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,279
those are the ones for me that I think I

2259
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,679
I you know I'm gonna be stuck on a

2260
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:56,519
desert island man I I really want

2261
01:34:54,679 --> 01:34:59,079
something that Got Away something

2262
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:02,080
something that reminds me of the day you

2263
01:34:59,079 --> 01:35:03,760
know do you keep Cuts very much or do

2264
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:06,039
you strictly work from SE yeah but

2265
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,000
mostly once again it's mostly like the

2266
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:10,560
Legacy stuff that I've that I really

2267
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,319
love like the N Champa stuff which one

2268
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,679
stuck around the longest n Champa of

2269
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:18,279
somebody else's work oh of somebody else

2270
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,279
oh

2271
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,480
yeah that's tough

2272
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,279
because I don't keep man I don't I don't

2273
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:30,678
keep I just don't like I just don't I

2274
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:32,519
don't covet Cuts I wish I had earlier

2275
01:35:30,679 --> 01:35:35,639
because when I was working in commercial

2276
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:38,360
dispensaries really heavily like I had

2277
01:35:35,639 --> 01:35:40,079
access to so much stuff and there was so

2278
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:42,198
much stuff the sour diesel deep chunk

2279
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,479
that we used to run orange ghost from

2280
01:35:42,198 --> 01:35:47,719
obsolete from back in the day there was

2281
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:49,359
a an orange Legends OG cut that he put

2282
01:35:47,719 --> 01:35:52,118
out that they used to have they had a

2283
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:56,719
Tiger's Milk cut that was just

2284
01:35:52,118 --> 01:35:59,559
stupid stupid and you know it's it's I

2285
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:01,840
wish I I wish I'd have thought earlier

2286
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:03,679
on like this is going to be full-time

2287
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,520
for me I'm going to do nothing but seeds

2288
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:07,600
and genetics because there was so many

2289
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,239
genetics that went through my hands that

2290
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:13,079
at the time I was just running flour you

2291
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:15,799
know I was just running grows of flow so

2292
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:17,439
it made sense to just you know run a

2293
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:22,279
tray of it run a couple trays of it till

2294
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:25,279
you're sick and run something else um

2295
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:27,399
yeah I don't know man uh other people's

2296
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:29,439
stuff that double purple Doge and Mental

2297
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:31,319
Floss got away from me back in the day

2298
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:33,839
and here's what's funny I'm not a big

2299
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:35,479
sativa guy it was more leaning on the

2300
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,679
sativa

2301
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:41,039
side but as a hash maker it was the

2302
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:44,679
first strain I ever saw that had purple

2303
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:48,039
tricomes which made purple sift and so

2304
01:36:44,679 --> 01:36:50,199
the first time I sifted it and I was

2305
01:36:48,039 --> 01:36:53,039
looking like I had done something wrong

2306
01:36:50,198 --> 01:36:55,000
it's like it doesn't even look purple

2307
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:57,399
you know what I'm saying like the first

2308
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,840
time you sift purple trikes it looks

2309
01:36:57,399 --> 01:37:02,519
gray and when you're used to seeing like

2310
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:05,560
white and like crystally white it's a

2311
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:08,360
weird thing the first time you see

2312
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:11,080
it So eventually I get the scope out you

2313
01:37:08,359 --> 01:37:13,719
know and I'm like scoping and I see you

2314
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:15,880
know you can see the pigment go up

2315
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:18,079
through the Tricom stock and then fill

2316
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:20,079
the Tricom head while they're

2317
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:22,079
maturing and then it all made you know

2318
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,679
it was one of those early like like

2319
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:26,198
you're just in your grow and you don't

2320
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,880
really realize once again this before

2321
01:37:26,198 --> 01:37:32,039
the internet so super macro pictures

2322
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:33,359
back then were not common you know

2323
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:36,920
people they weren't they weren't

2324
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:40,359
everywhere you didn't see these like

2325
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:43,560
amazing it pictures yeah of like two two

2326
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:45,679
Tricom individual tricomes you know and

2327
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,280
so uh yeah the first time I saw that it

2328
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:51,279
was a double purple DOA Mental Floss

2329
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:53,439
cross from Outlaw grower and uh it it

2330
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:55,679
kind of It kind of you know it's you

2331
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:58,719
have these points along your growing

2332
01:37:55,679 --> 01:38:01,399
career where you see something new and

2333
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:04,079
you know we all may find it on our own

2334
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:06,799
but to you it's a new kind of thing and

2335
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:10,079
it pushes you that little bit more uh

2336
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:12,000
you know into the minutia of growing and

2337
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:13,800
it's one of those things that really

2338
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,599
once you've realized something on that

2339
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:18,000
level that you didn't know now you just

2340
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:20,279
have that thought of like what else

2341
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,079
don't I know what else can I learn like

2342
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,759
what else small things am I missing

2343
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:27,800
because I you know the first time you

2344
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:29,679
see purple Keef and you're just making

2345
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:32,320
Keef on your own and it doesn't look

2346
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:35,599
like the rest of it you're just like

2347
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:38,519
whoa whoa I mean now we've all seen a

2348
01:38:35,599 --> 01:38:41,800
purple Rosen drip or we've all seen you

2349
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:44,000
know yeah they're out there it's not I I

2350
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:46,159
don't know if everybody has man there's

2351
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,079
some people that just I've met through

2352
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:52,039
doing this uh we've got patreon members

2353
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:53,760
from all over the world love of cannabis

2354
01:38:52,039 --> 01:38:57,039
is intense but there's a lot of people

2355
01:38:53,760 --> 01:39:00,719
that really don't do social media that

2356
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:02,920
just like oh well I saw your podcast and

2357
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,760
I came on here and yeah we grow weed

2358
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:07,199
like that's awesome it's [ __ ] awesome

2359
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,639
that's awesome I love those people

2360
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:12,039
because they're not jaded by all of the

2361
01:39:09,639 --> 01:39:15,319
things that you maybe you or I are Jaded

2362
01:39:12,039 --> 01:39:17,439
by because we see them 18 million times

2363
01:39:15,319 --> 01:39:19,198
on the internet like I made a meme that

2364
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:21,598
the worst headache you can have is

2365
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:22,879
watching what's wrong with my plant

2366
01:39:21,599 --> 01:39:24,560
posts on

2367
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:28,279
Reddit

2368
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:30,199
oh oh the level of pain like you do it

2369
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:32,158
for five minutes and just go scrolling

2370
01:39:30,198 --> 01:39:34,079
through and look what's wrong with my

2371
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:38,000
plant here's a single leaf what's wrong

2372
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:40,439
with my plant oh oh it's so bad and it's

2373
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,279
like people that don't know all of those

2374
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:44,759
cliches and the things that we've all

2375
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:46,920
seen a million time those are the best

2376
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,840
because let's be honest they come from a

2377
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:52,199
place of like weed the love and it's a

2378
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:55,279
plant and that's it Yeah Yeah the more

2379
01:39:52,198 --> 01:39:57,519
calag joke is is we we beat that one to

2380
01:39:55,279 --> 01:40:00,158
death too though but that is the funny

2381
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:03,520
thing about the more calag joke is how

2382
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:05,158
apt it actually is because it's twofold

2383
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:07,080
right the joke is just add more Cal Mag

2384
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:09,879
it makes everything better there are

2385
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:12,760
literally people that are using cowm mag

2386
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:16,199
as some sort of a crutch or that it's

2387
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:18,760
it's got to be in everything or you know

2388
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:21,638
and here's the funny thing calcium and

2389
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:23,639
calcium and magnesium are both

2390
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:25,880
micronutrients so your plant doesn't

2391
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:28,359
need a ton of either one of them I mean

2392
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:31,079
it needs them but not in these massive

2393
01:40:28,359 --> 01:40:32,799
amounts and the joke is that like more

2394
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:35,800
micronutrients isn't going to help your

2395
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,599
plant one iota but it's the duct tape of

2396
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:39,840
the weed World something's wrong with

2397
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:42,760
your weed more cow mag in two more weeks

2398
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:46,360
and you're good we do have synthetic

2399
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:50,599
Growers we've got Sanic Growers uh but

2400
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:55,000
what I do myself is no tail living soil

2401
01:40:50,599 --> 01:40:55,000
so the amount of times that I recommend

2402
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:02,520
caleg most organic gardeners would know

2403
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:04,880
mag was you yeah you shouldn't see it on

2404
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:06,920
the Shelf I mean if you really need to

2405
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,920
get some oyster shell or something like

2406
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:14,039
that in there bone meal work it in top

2407
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:18,520
dress it you know that's just kind of

2408
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:21,319
like being aware of you know your soil

2409
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:25,159
and re amending it but the amount times

2410
01:41:21,319 --> 01:41:27,639
I've needed to add caleg no you probably

2411
01:41:25,158 --> 01:41:30,519
don't own a PPH you probably don't own a

2412
01:41:27,639 --> 01:41:32,639
EC PPM meter either yeah no you wouldn't

2413
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:34,440
need one you know it's it's it came from

2414
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,760
the commercialization of the industry it

2415
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:39,238
came from the fact that now every town

2416
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:42,039
has a large scale grow store and those

2417
01:41:39,238 --> 01:41:43,359
guys make money selling you stuff and so

2418
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:45,118
when you go in there and you don't know

2419
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:47,079
what you need they're going to sell you

2420
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:48,920
anything they can and that makes them

2421
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:50,559
more money I mean that's why most of

2422
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:53,000
those nutrient lines are broken down

2423
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,719
into 12 different bottles they could

2424
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,039
sell you all that into two bottles they

2425
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:59,359
just can't charge you as much for it you

2426
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:00,639
know you don't really need 90% of that

2427
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:02,158
stuff and then you go in there and

2428
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:04,118
you're like I don't know what I need can

2429
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:07,198
you hook me up like I need you know

2430
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:10,359
they're like you need cow mag I'm gonna

2431
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:12,559
talk [ __ ] just because I was the scer at

2432
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:15,519
one point so I feel like I get to talk

2433
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,639
[ __ ] about my old self here yeah but

2434
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,880
most of those bottled nutrient companies

2435
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:23,920
I feel like those balls are 90% water

2436
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:27,079
and that's not just because that's the

2437
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:30,199
popular way of thinking but I like doing

2438
01:42:27,079 --> 01:42:35,079
uh I practice knf and making my own

2439
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:40,000
nutrients for my soil and I can make

2440
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:42,238
nutrients for my soil at a fraction of

2441
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,840
the cost and by fraction of the cost I'm

2442
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:47,479
talking about what I would have been

2443
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:52,560
paying with uh a seven part ball system

2444
01:42:47,479 --> 01:42:55,799
for one bottle I'm doing like one2 200th

2445
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:59,840
of that it's a trillion dollar industry

2446
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:02,599
and per dilution rate I'm using way less

2447
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,079
than what's recommended on any bottle

2448
01:43:02,599 --> 01:43:06,719
yeah that's the trick that I tell so

2449
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:08,319
many new Growers is like whatever you

2450
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,118
pick whatever you start with you

2451
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:13,198
probably need half of whatever's been

2452
01:43:10,118 --> 01:43:16,479
recommended to you you know like for a

2453
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:18,919
lot of people uh the way that you grow

2454
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:21,000
is very much a passion it's the sort of

2455
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:24,520
thing that you find at a certain certain

2456
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:27,479
point and it's a very beautiful niche of

2457
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:30,119
the market so many people that get

2458
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:32,759
started the thought of having you know

2459
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:35,559
Vats of stuff rotting around their house

2460
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:39,280
to make nutrients to dilute it is such a

2461
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:40,679
foreign concept that you know so many

2462
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:42,920
people go into the grow store and just

2463
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:45,079
like I need a bag of something I need a

2464
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:47,880
bottle of something and I need a

2465
01:43:45,079 --> 01:43:49,719
light you're lucky if that's you know

2466
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:52,319
and that's that's pretty much the grow

2467
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:55,198
store is like oh we got you we got six

2468
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:56,639
or seven bottles for you we got fans you

2469
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,238
you're not going to believe it we got

2470
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,319
and it's a trillion dollar everything

2471
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:03,959
you need yeah it's a trillion dollar

2472
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:06,719
industry if not more and there's so much

2473
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,560
just snaker in that and it's like it

2474
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:10,920
it's overwhelming now because when you

2475
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:13,000
go into a lot of these huge Grow shops

2476
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:15,520
there's so much stuff that even as a

2477
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,960
seasoned grower it's it's shocking at

2478
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,239
first because you're just like good Lord

2479
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,719
I've seen all of this and I've never

2480
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:23,118
seen half of this you know like you guys

2481
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:25,520
got stuff you know I always joked about

2482
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:29,519
the in the late 90s early 2000s there

2483
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:32,239
was always this it was like a lamp mover

2484
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:35,239
but it was essentially like a bladed fan

2485
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:38,359
with like 15 blades and they just had

2486
01:44:35,238 --> 01:44:41,399
like screwed in hiid bulbs and it would

2487
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:44,198
spin just like a like a Fanwood and I

2488
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:46,079
never saw anybody buy them but for more

2489
01:44:44,198 --> 01:44:49,638
than a decade every time I went into the

2490
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:52,279
grow shop they had them on display and I

2491
01:44:49,639 --> 01:44:54,199
would always think to to myself like

2492
01:44:52,279 --> 01:44:56,479
it's the same amount of light it's just

2493
01:44:54,198 --> 01:44:58,960
going in a circle like it's not like a

2494
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,919
proper light mover where it's moving you

2495
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:04,158
know four feet away and you're covering

2496
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:06,560
more canopy it was the most useless tool

2497
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:10,158
I could ever think of they were probably

2498
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:12,760
hundreds if not more dollars each and I

2499
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:16,359
guarantee you there's somebody out there

2500
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:18,480
running one of them things still today

2501
01:45:16,359 --> 01:45:20,880
you know and swears it's gotten them

2502
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:25,638
increased yields but it's like there's

2503
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:29,719
so much junk there's so much just

2504
01:45:25,639 --> 01:45:33,000
Foolery but wait there's more yeah

2505
01:45:29,719 --> 01:45:39,480
almost like the the As Seen On TV level

2506
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:42,639
yeah so cheesy and it's like they two

2507
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:44,359
$29.95 yeah they make money selling you

2508
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,520
stuff so like don't listen to anything

2509
01:45:44,359 --> 01:45:48,198
those guys say like figure out what you

2510
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,159
need ahead of time figure out what your

2511
01:45:48,198 --> 01:45:51,719
Niche is in the market you know if you

2512
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:53,638
just want want to grow Organics learn

2513
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:55,840
about Organics if you want to grow

2514
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:58,199
synthetics learn about Hydro learn about

2515
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,639
synthetics but it's like the last person

2516
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:03,000
you need to go take your grow tip advice

2517
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:05,239
from is the guy that makes money from

2518
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,439
your

2519
01:46:05,238 --> 01:46:09,718
failure that's a million dollars worth

2520
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:11,238
of game because those guy and not to say

2521
01:46:09,719 --> 01:46:14,279
I haven't met some awesome dudes that

2522
01:46:11,238 --> 01:46:17,359
work at the grow shop but their whole

2523
01:46:14,279 --> 01:46:20,039
business is on you needing to spend more

2524
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:24,639
money whether that's on more bottles of

2525
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:27,198
n more pots more lights more fans they

2526
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:28,800
make money when you have to spend so

2527
01:46:27,198 --> 01:46:30,678
like going to them and asking them

2528
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,639
immediately what do I

2529
01:46:30,679 --> 01:46:35,960
need you need all of it we got the best

2530
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:38,199
lights you can think of we we're g to

2531
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,198
get you on the 12 bottle system it's

2532
01:46:38,198 --> 01:46:41,879
super easy don't even worry you're going

2533
01:46:40,198 --> 01:46:45,960
to use them all at the same time it

2534
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:45,960
doesn't really matter it's all the same

2535
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:52,198
[ __ ] yeah and I mean I don't know like

2536
01:46:49,479 --> 01:46:55,198
as we see more new growers in more legal

2537
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:57,000
states right there's a million new the

2538
01:46:55,198 --> 01:46:59,439
joke is the reason Blue Dream will

2539
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,560
always be somebody's favorite strain is

2540
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:03,719
because a new state is about to go legal

2541
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:05,840
soon and there's another couple million

2542
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:07,639
people that have seen Blue Dream in High

2543
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,840
Times and they heard everybody talk

2544
01:47:07,639 --> 01:47:12,719
about blue dream and now they can

2545
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,000

strain and so now there's a million new

need because there's somebody out there

2554
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:34,598
willing to take you for a lot more than

2555
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,960
you should be spending to get started in

2556
01:47:34,599 --> 01:47:38,880
a

2557
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:40,319
grow how do I feel about blue dream how

2558
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,480
do you feel about blue dream now that

2559
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:45,238
you said that

2560
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:47,638
so what's funny about Blue

2561
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:51,399
Dream It's the only strain that I've

2562
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:54,039
ever seen a documented three a light

2563
01:47:51,399 --> 01:47:56,359
in a thousand in thousand watt bulb

2564
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:59,920
grows it's the only strand I've ever

2565
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:03,880
actually seen pull three a light so I

2566
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:05,840
can't argue with why it's popular right

2567
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:09,400
it's it's a beautiful

2568
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:11,520
strain when it grows huge

2569
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:14,399
buds lots of

2570
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:17,520
resin got kind of a generic blueberry

2571
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:21,279
muffin profile it's not going to get

2572
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:24,239
anybody out there too high

2573
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:27,158
never have to worry about that you know

2574
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:28,559
how do you feel about it it will never

2575
01:48:27,158 --> 01:48:32,598
be in my

2576
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:34,159
grow okay it hasn't I I've never this a

2577
01:48:32,599 --> 01:48:36,920
long running joke that you don't know

2578
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:39,000
the backstory on oh okay I need to ask

2579
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:40,239
you believe me you're not you're not the

2580
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,880
you're not the first to have a blue

2581
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:45,479
dream joke I actually another I still

2582
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:47,480
have it I still have the good no this

2583
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:52,279
joke it's this joke has one more layer

2584
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:55,399
of Comedy to it so I actually did start

2585
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:58,158
a Facebook group you can still go find

2586
01:48:55,399 --> 01:48:59,319
it today it's called the closet Blue

2587
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:03,279
Dream

2588
01:48:59,319 --> 01:49:05,639
lovers and the joke was you can now put

2589
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:07,920
your friends who talk Blue Dream up

2590
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:10,279
amongst themselves and and have the

2591
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,039
whole argument about it's so why it's so

2592
01:49:10,279 --> 01:49:14,960
amazing and they go and you can just add

2593
01:49:12,039 --> 01:49:17,479
them to the Facebook group The

2594
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,639
clauset it's still it's still out there

2595
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:21,678
floating around it's never been very

2596
01:49:19,639 --> 01:49:23,560
active but it's once again man I'm

2597
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,480
starting up groups to bring people

2598
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,560
together that have common interests

2599
01:49:25,479 --> 01:49:30,000
pooping fetishes Blue Dream fetishes you

2600
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,080
know whatever it is man I'm here to

2601
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,880
support the bringing together of just

2602
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:37,118
like-minded souls and

2603
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:38,840
individuals yeah sounds like my group so

2604
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:40,920
what's now I gotta know what's do I feel

2605
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,279
bad for being in it what's the blue

2606
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:46,118
dream

2607
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:49,039
joke oh uh it's not a blue dream joke so

2608
01:49:46,118 --> 01:49:51,880
yeah I still keep uh the Santa Cruz cut

2609
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:55,719
just because I agree with everything you

2610
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:57,719
said it's got a very generic taste uh it

2611
01:49:55,719 --> 01:50:00,198
is an impressive

2612
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:03,158
yielder I I like the bag Appeal on it

2613
01:50:00,198 --> 01:50:05,000
too I think it's just a goodlook bud um

2614
01:50:03,158 --> 01:50:07,359
but the plant structure too it's a

2615
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:12,520
strong plant and it's really good at

2616
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:15,799
holding weight you know um so i' always

2617
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:19,520
when I started getting interested in

2618
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:21,920
making seeds for myself it wasn't that I

2619
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:24,920
loved blue dream or anything it was like

2620
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,760
it's a strong plant it's a solid yielder

2621
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:30,199
is this something that I could increase

2622
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:32,360
the potency on and give a better flavor

2623
01:50:30,198 --> 01:50:35,319
while still retaining that yield or not

2624
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:38,399
taking it down too much you know still

2625
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:40,319
retaining those base traits um but I

2626
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:41,519
have not bred with it yet and it's just

2627
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:43,198
kind of been something that was

2628
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,639
nostalgic for me that I kind of kept

2629
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:48,399
around to see if I could do that one day

2630
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:52,440
um but it's nostalgic for me because we

2631
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:57,158
used to we have you ever heard of rad

2632
01:50:52,439 --> 01:51:00,118
boarding I'm not sure okay so it's this

2633
01:50:57,158 --> 01:51:03,158
like country boy redneck game it's a lot

2634
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:05,279
of fun but we all go down from the deep

2635
01:51:03,158 --> 01:51:09,519
I'm from the Deep South so try me okay

2636
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:11,399
so this so dangerous uh but if you do it

2637
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,199
and you're good at it and you figure it

2638
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:17,238
out it's a lot of fun but essentially

2639
01:51:14,198 --> 01:51:18,399
what we do is we take this rad board and

2640
01:51:17,238 --> 01:51:22,158
it's like

2641
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:24,638
this not cra Moon not d-shaped but

2642
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:26,679
somewhere in between just slightly a

2643
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:31,279
truck or a bulldozzer

2644
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:33,440
neither okay so we tie a rope to a tree

2645
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:35,439
and then to that rope you tie a bungee

2646
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:38,198
cord and then you attach the bungee cord

2647
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:40,279
to the board and you lean on the board

2648
01:51:38,198 --> 01:51:42,960
and ride it out into the current of the

2649
01:51:40,279 --> 01:51:44,920
river and if you lean the board back the

2650
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,118
current pushes you back and it stretches

2651
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:49,158
out the bungee cord and then when you

2652
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:51,359
get up on it and you start to lean

2653
01:51:49,158 --> 01:51:55,920
forward you can surf in the river like

2654
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:59,198
that gotcha yeah but if you like if you

2655
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:01,960
mess up and you land in front of that

2656
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:04,319
board it's on that bungee and it loses

2657
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:06,118
tension yeah it's scary but it's an

2658
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:08,000
awesome sport it's a lot of fun I've

2659
01:52:06,118 --> 01:52:11,279
done it quite a few times but I've seen

2660
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,118
people get messed up from it too um but

2661
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:18,399
that there was this dude that used to

2662
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:20,479
run it down here in our area and he just

2663
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:22,078
he grew all kinds of blue dream that was

2664
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:23,799
like the only thing he ever wanted to

2665
01:52:22,078 --> 01:52:26,559
grow just because it was such a

2666
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:28,639
production plant you know and he could

2667
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,920
get tons of yield back then and you

2668
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:33,400
could get decent money for weed you know

2669
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:35,639
so we we have this it's the conversation

2670
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:38,279
that's it's it's cliche at this point

2671
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:40,760
right because I I joked we were gonna do

2672
01:52:38,279 --> 01:52:43,519
an hour just about blue dream and we

2673
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,960
were just gonna steal man on one side

2674
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,480
and and and Devil's Advocate the other

2675
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:49,078
side and we're just going to have the

2676
01:52:47,479 --> 01:52:51,519
conversation that you and I have

2677
01:52:49,078 --> 01:52:53,639
probably had 100 Times by now about the

2678
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:56,119
one side says it's the production strain

2679
01:52:53,639 --> 01:52:57,520
it's immune to PM it's you know it's got

2680
01:52:56,118 --> 01:52:59,479
all these beautiful traits and that's

2681
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,800
why we run it and then the other side

2682
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:02,319
goes yeah but nobody's getting ey on

2683
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,079
that [ __ ] so after about the second

2684
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:06,118
joint nobody wants to smoke it because

2685
01:53:04,078 --> 01:53:08,679
it's kind of just a generic Bland

2686
01:53:06,118 --> 01:53:10,719
profile and and the other problem is it

2687
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:13,319
is such a production Workhorse so so

2688
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:15,239
many people have beat it I mean just

2689
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:18,238
cloned it and run it and clone it and

2690
01:53:15,238 --> 01:53:20,399
run it and clone it and run it and so

2691
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:23,519
back when I would see it heavily

2692
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:26,279
like you know years back it was always

2693
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,360
in the most gross amounts you could ever

2694
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:30,039
see a point where you just go nobody

2695
01:53:28,359 --> 01:53:33,039
wants that amount of blue dream why did

2696
01:53:30,039 --> 01:53:34,399
you grow so much blue dream like and

2697
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:36,920
it's not that really that they grew that

2698
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:38,839
many plants it just yields that well and

2699
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:41,480
so it just throws these like super

2700
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:43,920
symmetrical for a sativa it yields

2701
01:53:41,479 --> 01:53:46,039
really well you know for a fairly sativa

2702
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,039
leaning plant um but yeah I worked in a

2703
01:53:46,039 --> 01:53:50,599
dispensary it was like 180,000 foot

2704
01:53:48,039 --> 01:53:53,840
indoor grow and they would grow six and

2705
01:53:50,599 --> 01:53:56,279
seven8 foot tall blue dream buds uh

2706
01:53:53,840 --> 01:54:00,119
plants and it would literally have arm

2707
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:02,039
siiz single colas on the top of everyone

2708
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:05,319
and I mean yeah it's the only grow I've

2709
01:54:02,039 --> 01:54:07,840
ever seen documented yielded over three

2710
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:11,238
ofite you know three pounds per thousand

2711
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:14,319
watt I've never grown that much BL green

2712
01:54:11,238 --> 01:54:18,118
I FL I flower out a plant here and there

2713
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:20,238
just for a nostalgic taste y it's on the

2714
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:21,799
tur Okay so

2715
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:24,559
let me move on to the second part of

2716
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:26,320
that before everybody forgets though how

2717
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:29,360
do you feel about purple

2718
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:31,920
punch uh I'm a lot more positive than I

2719
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:31,920
am about blue

2720
01:54:32,118 --> 01:54:37,238
dream here's why here's why here's why

2721
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:40,279
and this comes from a resin guy point of

2722
01:54:37,238 --> 01:54:42,718
view right so blue dream does not make

2723
01:54:40,279 --> 01:54:45,238
great hash the funny thing about it is

2724
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:47,480
it's got tons of resin it doesn't it

2725
01:54:45,238 --> 01:54:49,919
might throw down in the wash but then

2726
01:54:47,479 --> 01:54:52,078
it's got really waxy tricomes so when

2727
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:54,480
you go to press it there's tons of stock

2728
01:54:52,078 --> 01:54:56,359
there's tons of wax there's tons of loss

2729
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,879
it doesn't make six-star melt I've never

2730
01:54:56,359 --> 01:55:02,719
seen Blue Dream throw down pure true

2731
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:05,400
six-star amazing melt right now purple

2732
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:07,760
punch is a different story when it comes

2733
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:10,519
to wash when it comes to resin purple

2734
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:13,880
punch is one of those strains that as a

2735
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:16,800
breeder um it's going to make amazing

2736
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:18,400
crosses with amazing resin and the

2737
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,920
beautiful thing about purple punch is

2738
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:23,759
that it's not that loud of a profile so

2739
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,760
what you can do is you take a really

2740
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:29,039
turpy daddy and you hit it to a purple

2741
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:30,599
punch and now you've got something

2742
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:32,599
that's worth talking about it's kind of

2743
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:34,480
like slurricane nobody's ever going to

2744
01:55:32,599 --> 01:55:36,360
be like I got 10 jars of slurricane

2745
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:40,479
you're never going to get enough of it

2746
01:55:36,359 --> 01:55:44,319
but it makes amazing crosses amazing

2747
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:45,799
wash crosses amazing hash crosses um and

2748
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:48,158
the Beautiful Thing is with both of

2749
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:50,679
those strains the resin tends to break

2750
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:52,559
really evenly from the triome stock so

2751
01:55:50,679 --> 01:55:54,319
that's why people love to Hash them

2752
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,719
because though they're by themselves not

2753
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:59,519
the most turpy profiles they're great

2754
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:01,158
for making crosses with yeah and and

2755
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,199
it's another one that like I don't run a

2756
01:56:01,158 --> 01:56:06,238
ton but I have made some purple punch

2757
01:56:03,198 --> 01:56:07,078
crosses that were just amazing amazing

2758
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:09,238
hash

2759
01:56:07,078 --> 01:56:12,078
strains but I don't run either I don't

2760
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:13,919
run either cut why is purple punch the

2761
01:56:12,078 --> 01:56:16,198
blue dream of the 21st century is that

2762
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,078
the implication I'll go ahead and say

2763
01:56:16,198 --> 01:56:20,118
what hasn't been said in this one I'll

2764
01:56:18,078 --> 01:56:22,840
address the elephant in the room I I'm

2765
01:56:20,118 --> 01:56:25,238
that I'm a I'm stubborn about it I

2766
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:27,078
defend blue dream in those things like I

2767
01:56:25,238 --> 01:56:28,559
all agree with you it's not what are

2768
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:31,078
your thoughts on purple

2769
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:33,280
punch my thoughts on purple punch I have

2770
01:56:31,078 --> 01:56:35,759
nothing against purple punch at all yeah

2771
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:37,479
um I think I love the taste of purple

2772
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,920
punch just like I love the taste of Blue

2773
01:56:37,479 --> 01:56:43,039
Dream um but it's not I don't know that

2774
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,880
I love the taste of Blue Dream now it's

2775
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:47,439
not

2776
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:50,039
that it's not that it tastes good it's

2777
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:54,519
not that the turps are high on it it

2778
01:56:50,039 --> 01:56:56,920
it's just that specific flavor it's

2779
01:56:54,520 --> 01:57:01,280
nostalgic for me it brings back good

2780
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:03,399
memories that's why I said out plant of

2781
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:05,599
it here or there just to have like a

2782
01:57:03,399 --> 01:57:07,839
little bit of it just so I can reach

2783
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:10,279
into that jar and like roll it up but

2784
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:13,440
that was the other purpose of it too was

2785
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:16,519
can I use this as a base to breed

2786
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:20,039
something special that I find with right

2787
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:23,280
um to improve the potency improve the

2788
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:25,800
flavor take what I like about blue dream

2789
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:28,399
but make it better you know in my

2790
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:31,679
opinion can I tell you the funniest part

2791
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:34,638
about this conversation with you right

2792
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:35,800
now yeah is that I sense a little shame

2793
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:39,480
in your

2794
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:41,400
voice not at all as you and I I think it

2795
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:45,078
may come from it's because I hear it

2796
01:57:41,399 --> 01:57:47,799
over and stigma that you know exists oh

2797
01:57:45,078 --> 01:57:51,319
yeah there is a little bit of like I

2798
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:55,360
love it guys and it's shame at all I

2799
01:57:51,319 --> 01:57:57,359
know it's unpopular opinion you know but

2800
01:57:55,359 --> 01:58:00,759
I also have you ever bred with blue

2801
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:03,399
dream no why I've never even had now

2802
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:05,760
purple punch I've had in main because

2803
01:58:03,399 --> 01:58:08,960
have access to a more like never worked

2804
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:12,280
with it at all yeah but you have access

2805
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:14,920
to what your favorite thing is which is

2806
01:58:12,279 --> 01:58:17,359
those heavy turp obviously you're going

2807
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:19,118
to go I don't I don't fult you at all

2808
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:22,319
for having a strain that you love even

2809
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:26,078
if it's an unpopular strain you know and

2810
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:29,000
and I think the thing about blue dream

2811
01:58:26,078 --> 01:58:33,158
is that has it has become a cultural

2812
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:35,560
thing within the head weed Community

2813
01:58:33,158 --> 01:58:37,920
right it's it's not your shame doesn't

2814
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:40,360
come from you not feeling right about

2815
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:43,279
the fact that you love a strain what I'm

2816
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:46,198
saying is there is a cultural thing of

2817
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:49,359
like shame towards people who love

2818
01:58:46,198 --> 01:58:52,039
specifically blue dream if anything the

2819
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:55,479
tiny amount of shame that I felt there

2820
01:58:52,039 --> 01:58:57,800
was because me and my buddy we have this

2821
01:58:55,479 --> 01:59:00,118
funny long running thing like he'll make

2822
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:01,880
fun of me like yeah you're still you

2823
01:59:00,118 --> 01:59:03,519
still got that blue dream but he's got

2824
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:06,760
purple punch and I'm like you're still

2825
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:09,520
running purple punch there it is said I

2826
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:11,719
just said it first I get it I get it I

2827
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:14,159
like I said purple punch is one of those

2828
01:59:11,719 --> 01:59:15,880
things I I equivalate them the same

2829
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:18,479
because purple punch does not get me

2830
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:20,880
[ __ ] up I think the flavor is way

2831
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:22,879
better on purple punch like you said the

2832
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:26,480
resin is better and I think that's a big

2833
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:28,639
part of it it's heavy oil glandula

2834
01:59:26,479 --> 01:59:31,718
better oil to wax ratio and the triome

2835
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:34,319
yeah and it's a decent yielder too it's

2836
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:36,880
pretty it looks good but they're kind of

2837
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,359
in that same ballpark you know good

2838
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:41,279
yielder they've got their own original

2839
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:44,639
flavor even if you don't like it or you

2840
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:46,639
do like it um On's got a heavy yield

2841
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:48,639
quality the other ones got a heavy taste

2842
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:51,440
quality and neither of them are really

2843
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:54,760
going to [ __ ] yeah do you remember Sweet

2844
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:56,519
Tooth yeah I love sweet to the reason I

2845
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:59,599
didn't like blue dream was because it

2846
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:01,560
reminded me so much of Sweet Tooth I ran

2847
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:05,960
a ton of Sweet Tooth in like the late

2848
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:08,760
90s early 2000s and the profiles are so

2849
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:09,840
similar it's kind of like this just

2850
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:12,760
generic

2851
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,480
site is you how I usually described it I

2852
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:16,039
mean like I've seen some blue the thing

2853
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:19,359
about most of the Blue Dream flower I've

2854
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:21,960
seen is that the blueberry profile that

2855
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:24,719
is usually inherent to the flower

2856
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:27,760
doesn't always transfer to the finished

2857
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:29,480
weed so like with blue dream a lot of

2858
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:32,920
the Blue Dream flower that I see is just

2859
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:35,519
kind of a generic you know sweet kind of

2860
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:37,719
profile it's almost rare to see one that

2861
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:40,159
like you get a lot of that blueberry

2862
02:00:37,719 --> 02:00:42,920
complexity that is there on the flower

2863
02:00:40,158 --> 02:00:44,960
like when you grow it it smells nice it

2864
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:48,118
just yeah it just

2865
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:49,719
doesn't did you ever grow the blueberry

2866
02:00:48,118 --> 02:00:51,679
muffin

2867
02:00:49,719 --> 02:00:54,480
not blueberry muffin I've run a few

2868
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:56,599
fenos of blueberry years back and

2869
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:59,638
Through the Years here and there from

2870
02:00:56,599 --> 02:01:02,599
different seed Pops from DJ

2871
02:00:59,639 --> 02:01:06,960
Short okay but no I do remember a strain

2872
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:08,719
back in you know late 90s early 2000s

2873
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:12,319
that they used to call the Blueberry Yum

2874
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:14,719
Yum that was super heavy around Atlanta

2875
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:16,399
ludicrous wrote a song about it yeah was

2876
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:21,039
that not just

2877
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:21,039
blueberry uh in

2878
02:01:21,158 --> 02:01:24,479
depends on who you ask and what you're

2879
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:27,440
talking about like yes I don't think it

2880
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:30,118
was an entirely unique strain but I'm

2881
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:32,799
not sure if it was a DJ Short Blueberry

2882
02:01:30,118 --> 02:01:35,118
pheno but it was it was one of those

2883
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:38,079
that was just it tasted like

2884
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:39,880
blueberry you know just candy like

2885
02:01:38,078 --> 02:01:42,559
blueberry almost Blueberry muffiny

2886
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:44,960
Blueberry candy you know the best of the

2887
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:47,760
blueberry

2888
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,920
line oh man I don't know if I want to

2889
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:53,039
get into a hot take deep into two hours

2890
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:54,719
here man but I got it I got I got it I

2891
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:57,439
got it I got it man the guy that wrote

2892
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:59,198
the book on

2893
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:01,158
breeding while we're talking about

2894
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:04,000
blueberry the man who wrote the book on

2895
02:02:01,158 --> 02:02:06,238
cannabis breeding has also contributed

2896
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,760
one of the most hermatic strains in the

2897
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:10,479
history of cannabis

2898
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:13,480
genetics there that was a safe way of

2899
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:15,519
putting it there are so many problems in

2900
02:02:13,479 --> 02:02:17,519
blueberry that anybody that's ever

2901
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:19,520
worked with those that strain in any

2902
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:21,599
capacity whatsoever

2903
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,920
would really go like it's so funny when

2904
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:25,560
people ask me about Herms because that

2905
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:30,399
guy's been selling that strain for 40

2906
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:31,880
years now and every seed every seed has

2907
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:34,078
a very high probability of having

2908
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:38,960
hermaphroditic traits and he's blamed it

2909
02:02:34,078 --> 02:02:42,359
on the tie he's you know but in 40 years

2910
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:44,560
I feel like that's kind of fair you know

2911
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:46,759
I haven't apparent I think he took that

2912
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:49,039
from the blue tie and I haven't grown

2913
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:52,079
the blue tie to say for specific but

2914
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:54,920
grown a lot of ties and they're known

2915
02:02:52,078 --> 02:02:56,599
for her her mafism right so I think

2916
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,639
that's kind of a fair blame but at the

2917
02:02:56,599 --> 02:03:00,039
same

2918
02:02:57,639 --> 02:03:03,440
time when you've been doing it for a

2919
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:06,359
long time I feel like it's not only a

2920
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:09,158
goal but a responsibility for modern

2921
02:03:06,359 --> 02:03:12,598
cannabis to test your genetics and make

2922
02:03:09,158 --> 02:03:15,158
sure it's stable for the homeg grower

2923
02:03:12,599 --> 02:03:18,078
that can't afford to waste time for

2924
02:03:15,158 --> 02:03:20,598
their medicine growing out in stable

2925
02:03:18,078 --> 02:03:24,000
genetics well see here's a big issue

2926
02:03:20,599 --> 02:03:26,840
right stable has changed what stable

2927
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,359
meant through the late '90s early 2000s

2928
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,880
meant that if I bought a pack of 10

2929
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:34,319
seeds those 10 seeds would generally all

2930
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:36,480
look the same that was the term stable

2931
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:39,399
when I first started buying

2932
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:41,759
seeds as of late stable means they're

2933
02:03:39,399 --> 02:03:46,839
not going to

2934
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:48,480
hm this is tough man because one of my

2935
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:51,000
biggest pet peeves is the notion that

2936
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:53,039
we're going to solve the hermaphrodite

2937
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,439
Problem by over

2938
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,000
inbreeding so the notion that if instead

2939
02:03:55,439 --> 02:03:59,598
of there just being all these f1s and

2940
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,639
f2s everywhere if we had started and

2941
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:05,078
just done nothing but inbreed every one

2942
02:04:01,639 --> 02:04:07,800
of these lines to an F10 there would be

2943
02:04:05,078 --> 02:04:09,920
no Herms anymore the notion is that if

2944
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:12,679
you just work that line a little bit

2945
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:16,440
better there's going to be no more Herms

2946
02:04:12,679 --> 02:04:18,199
this is a plant that wants to breed

2947
02:04:16,439 --> 02:04:20,598
you're never going to get rid of it

2948
02:04:18,198 --> 02:04:23,558
natural inclination when it's stressed

2949
02:04:20,599 --> 02:04:26,159
especially late in life is to

2950
02:04:23,559 --> 02:04:27,079
breed so the notion that you're going to

2951
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:29,479
over

2952
02:04:27,078 --> 02:04:32,799
inbreed and make that problem just

2953
02:04:29,479 --> 02:04:36,678
miraculously disappear inbreeding is

2954
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:39,719
great for making a stable line of

2955
02:04:36,679 --> 02:04:40,719
breeding plants they look alike they

2956
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:43,480
breed

2957
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:46,880
alike right we only have to look to dog

2958
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:50,000
breeding to realize what over inbreeding

2959
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:53,039
does to a gene pool

2960
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,319
right there's certain breeds of dog that

2961
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:57,559
you can't have around kids because they

2962
02:04:55,319 --> 02:05:01,118
were bred to be white dogs with black

2963
02:04:57,559 --> 02:05:03,920
spots and nothing else so if we only

2964
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:06,399
focus on every filial generation of an

2965
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,880
inbreeding line we're getting rid of the

2966
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:11,118
Herms we got rid of the Herms but now

2967
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:13,599
we've created something nobody cares to

2968
02:05:11,118 --> 02:05:14,759
smoke because while you were focused on

2969
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:17,078
not having

2970
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:19,559
Herms you weren't paying any attention

2971
02:05:17,078 --> 02:05:21,558
to all the other 150 other things that

2972
02:05:19,559 --> 02:05:23,039
you need to look for in breeding a

2973
02:05:21,559 --> 02:05:26,159
modern cannabis

2974
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:28,519
strain so it's like that's one beautiful

2975
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:29,399
thing nobody wants people to lose money

2976
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:31,760
because of

2977
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:33,118
Herms but we have to be better about

2978
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,559
explaining to people that the notion

2979
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:38,399
that that's ever going to just disappear

2980
02:05:35,559 --> 02:05:43,079
that any breeder is selling seeds that

2981
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:45,719
produces an absolute 0% Herm ratio it

2982
02:05:43,078 --> 02:05:48,279
doesn't exist it yeah it does not exist

2983
02:05:45,719 --> 02:05:50,520
I'm glad that you went more in depth

2984
02:05:48,279 --> 02:05:53,759
with that absolutely but that's not to

2985
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:56,280
say that you can't breed for more stable

2986
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:59,119
genetics absolutely absolutely and it

2987
02:05:56,279 --> 02:06:01,399
should always be you know a number one

2988
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:03,158
priority in any breeding because that's

2989
02:06:01,399 --> 02:06:04,719
what the market dictates as necessary

2990
02:06:03,158 --> 02:06:07,078
you want plants that aren't going to

2991
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:09,800
throw female you know male flowers and

2992
02:06:07,078 --> 02:06:14,238
and Herm a whole room and ruin people's

2993
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:18,679
money but the other side to that

2994
02:06:14,238 --> 02:06:20,238
is if I pop 200 seeds from from assorted

2995
02:06:18,679 --> 02:06:22,480
different

2996
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:24,399
breeders I could probably make every one

2997
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:27,959
of those plants flip male

2998
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:30,558
flowers oh yeah every every one of them

2999
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:32,158
which means that not necessarily you're

3000
02:06:30,559 --> 02:06:35,480
lucky if it doesn't happen to you but

3001
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:38,000
what I'm saying is at the end of a plant

3002
02:06:35,479 --> 02:06:40,118
stage you have to just be diligent

3003
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,719
growing this plant indoors like it's one

3004
02:06:40,118 --> 02:06:43,279
of those things that like we're doing

3005
02:06:41,719 --> 02:06:45,520
really unnatural things with the way

3006
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:48,158
we're forcing them to grow the spectrums

3007
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:51,239
we're using pruning techniques with with

3008
02:06:48,158 --> 02:06:54,598
training techniques with indoor lighting

3009
02:06:51,238 --> 02:06:56,558
so like the notion that you can breed a

3010
02:06:54,599 --> 02:06:59,679
perfect strain that's going to hit every

3011
02:06:56,559 --> 02:07:02,880
box isn't going to hm you know it's it's

3012
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:05,960
it's going to wash 5% you know it's

3013
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:08,800
going to be all resin and no wax

3014
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:10,559
like man you know and it's one of those

3015
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,279
things that like as a breeder you think

3016
02:07:10,559 --> 02:07:14,000
about all of this you want you know you

3017
02:07:12,279 --> 02:07:15,880
want to make perfect selections you want

3018
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,158
to do the right you know the right

3019
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,078
selection and make sure every and when

3020
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,279
it comes down to is just having an eye

3021
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:23,880
it's something you can't really teach

3022
02:07:22,279 --> 02:07:27,039
it's something you can't really tell

3023
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:28,920
somebody how to do from looking at

3024
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:30,760
thousands and thousands of plants and

3025
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:33,199
finally having an eye to be able to see

3026
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:35,719
what you're not seeing to see the

3027
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:38,078
potential in a plant male plant female

3028
02:07:35,719 --> 02:07:40,399
plant you know that's going to bring

3029
02:07:38,078 --> 02:07:42,599
something that you haven't seen

3030
02:07:40,399 --> 02:07:45,158
before and that's you know once you've

3031
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:47,319
seen 100,000 plants I always tell people

3032
02:07:45,158 --> 02:07:49,000
biggest mistake a new grower will make

3033
02:07:47,319 --> 02:07:51,558
is keeping around a plant they should

3034
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:54,078
have gotten rid of because they haven't

3035
02:07:51,559 --> 02:07:57,079
had that thing yet of not every plant's

3036
02:07:54,078 --> 02:07:58,479
a winner you know even in a large enough

3037
02:07:57,078 --> 02:07:59,880
selection you're going to kill some

3038
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:02,718
plants off you're going to get rid of

3039
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:05,559
some plants any great grower has killed

3040
02:08:02,719 --> 02:08:07,639
a couple plants along the way you know

3041
02:08:05,559 --> 02:08:09,679
both intentionally and

3042
02:08:07,639 --> 02:08:11,078
unintentionally and you know one of the

3043
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:12,719
things that you have to do is you just

3044
02:08:11,078 --> 02:08:15,158
have to say look if this plant

3045
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:17,078
struggling it's probably easier for you

3046
02:08:15,158 --> 02:08:20,198
to start another plant or to have

3047
02:08:17,078 --> 02:08:21,279
started 15% more plants so that you can

3048
02:08:20,198 --> 02:08:23,558
account for the fact that you're going

3049
02:08:21,279 --> 02:08:26,000
to have to kill some of them thank you

3050
02:08:23,559 --> 02:08:29,199
you know and so many people drag those

3051
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,479
plants into flower and they're like you

3052
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:33,000
know maybe it's just genetics maybe it's

3053
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:35,519
just it doesn't like your feeding

3054
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,238
regimen you know but just having a less

3055
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:39,239
Discerning Eye about plants and just

3056
02:08:37,238 --> 02:08:41,558
saying you know what some of them are

3057
02:08:39,238 --> 02:08:43,158
going to die and if they're not healthy

3058
02:08:41,559 --> 02:08:46,159
sometimes it's easier to get rid of them

3059
02:08:43,158 --> 02:08:48,638
than it is to drag a sick plant into the

3060
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:51,000
garden into flower and now you've

3061
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:52,840
brought all kinds of other issues and

3062
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,439
pathogens and all kind it's a sick plant

3063
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:57,440
you know anything can attack it now

3064
02:08:55,439 --> 02:08:59,960
thank you for saying that I know uh we

3065
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:03,359
were talking about that the other day uh

3066
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:05,279
you really become ruthless when you're

3067
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:08,719
doing a big hunt and you're looking for

3068
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:10,519
something very specific um or even just

3069
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:12,078
trying to pull things apart you don't

3070
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:14,960
have time if you're going to find that

3071
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:17,000
something special uh to be going through

3072
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,840
these and putting up with the runs or

3073
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,800
putting up with the heavy mut

3074
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:22,480
that aren't worth a [ __ ] in veg and

3075
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:26,800
can't keep up with anything else you

3076
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:28,919
know it's I popped a 12pack and I had

3077
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:30,559
two that were really runny and I just

3078
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:32,719
pulled them out right away and

3079
02:09:30,559 --> 02:09:34,119
everybody's like why didn't you see you

3080
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:36,239
know they might have been females I'm

3081
02:09:34,118 --> 02:09:38,198
like I do not have time for that [ __ ]

3082
02:09:36,238 --> 02:09:40,558
anymore because at the end of the day

3083
02:09:38,198 --> 02:09:42,279
what I want is I want that plant that

3084
02:09:40,559 --> 02:09:44,440
excelled you know that's the one that

3085
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:47,279
I'm going to keep around not only is it

3086
02:09:44,439 --> 02:09:49,439
a great smoke but it's got to grow well

3087
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:52,439
too I don't care care how good the smoke

3088
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:57,198
is if it takes me [ __ ] four months to

3089
02:09:52,439 --> 02:09:59,000
veg it out n I'm good y there's so much

3090
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:01,638
of that man that

3091
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,880
like as a as a grower who's done it a

3092
02:10:01,639 --> 02:10:06,440
few times you kind of come to understand

3093
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:10,359
that what you want is a plant that from

3094
02:10:06,439 --> 02:10:12,719
the minute it hits water it has the

3095
02:10:10,359 --> 02:10:15,639
healthiest and most beautiful life it

3096
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:18,319
can right so I see all the time because

3097
02:10:15,639 --> 02:10:20,840
I work around hash makers I work with

3098
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:23,519
hash Growers I work with breeders or you

3099
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:25,960
know other breeders who focus on hash um

3100
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:30,079
I ask people all the time

3101
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:32,960
like what's important to you in your

3102
02:10:30,078 --> 02:10:35,439
grow right is probably not going to be

3103
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:38,000
important to somebody else in their

3104
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:40,519
selection so when when I'm picking for

3105
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,118
what makes a great hash strain it's

3106
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:45,639
almost never what somebody else is

3107
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:47,679
thinking it's almost always like what is

3108
02:10:45,639 --> 02:10:50,239
what what what do I feel like what am I

3109
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:51,960
the most passion about because if I'm

3110
02:10:50,238 --> 02:10:53,359
putting passion into every selection

3111
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:55,118
into every thought into everything that

3112
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:57,039
I'm doing in the garden at the end of

3113
02:10:55,118 --> 02:10:59,000
the day the results are going to show

3114
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:01,399
from that and the plants that people

3115
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
pick up and run are going to be grown

3116
02:11:01,399 --> 02:11:06,799
from minute one from what I thought was

3117
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,520
the best that I could pick all right

3118
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:11,599
