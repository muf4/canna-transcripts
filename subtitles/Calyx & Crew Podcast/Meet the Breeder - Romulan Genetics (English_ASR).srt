00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:18,480
best sensors on the market right now at

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,400
a retail value of only what 69

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,118
you can pick up a sensor that checks

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,598
your humidity your temperature your vpd

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,240
and i heard from anton coming here soon

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,118
is also going to include not only the

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,518
chart

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,039
for the live vpd but co2 as well which

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,679
is very very nice

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,079

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,878
how you doing

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879

some heat over here today i got a little

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,439
bit warmed up i rolled up some sour

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
diesel for this and i just wanted to

28
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,640
talk to you you know

29
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,599
we've been talking about doing something

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,599
like this for a very long time and today

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,239
is the right day

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,399
today is the day

33
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,920
so before we get started

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
not all of my listeners are going to

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,519
know who romulan genetics is the story

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,439
behind romulan or anything like that why

37
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,679
don't you introduce yourself really

38
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,519
quick tell everybody who you are what

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,439
you do what your company is about and

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,859
what your goal is

41
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,239
i'll try to remember all this

42
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,959

my name is jake i'm the owner of romulan

44
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,399
genetics you can find us on

rumblinggenetics.com

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
i've got an instagram under the same

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,000
name i've been around in breeding for

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,439
going on two or three years now i forget

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,280
in 2015 my father passed away and as

50
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,959
part of him passing away

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,879
the romulan clone that was kept in our

52
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,199
family which wasn't known as ramayana by

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,039
our family but it was handed over to me

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,359
and it was kind of the torch was passed

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
and i was told to keep it alive and do

56
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,359
well with it and

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
i started uh by giving clones and cuts

58
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,080
away for a long time and then eventually

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,360
kind of people just kept pressuring me

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
you know hey you got to make seeds you

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,599
gotta you gotta do some stuff and so i

62
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,598
started doing it just as a hobby and i

63
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,280
got such great positive reaction it

64
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,598
turned into far more than that it's kind

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,479
of become a life calling passion more

66
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,318
than a hobby now i'm really stoned right

67
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,560
now so i'm gonna try to

68
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,159
remember i remember you said my goals

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
and then there was something in between

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,318
something in between that maybe i missed

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,199
there but as far as future goals i don't

72
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,359
uh

73
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,719
i've got a small little road map plan

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
that i've been sticking to for the past

75
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,000
few years of

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
things that i you know right when i kind

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,199
of set my mind that i'm gonna do this

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,120
and do romulan genetics

79
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,799
i came up with a bunch of stuff that i

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,159
knew i wanted to breed it with that i

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
knew i wanted to try and see what it

82
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,400
would come out like and then i had some

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
other things that were personal projects

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,439
that i wanted to do

85
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,878
and so i've been sticking to that road

86
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,840
map and i've got i don't know about

87
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,840
another two or three years left of that

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
and i figure once i get done doing that

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,519
it has a lot to do with making a as many

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,280
rig seed lines as i can along with a few

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
feminized versions in between to kind of

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,759
keep people happy that like to grow

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
those

94
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,919
but my plan is with the reg steep stuff

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,680
is is to get us a decent stable for me

96
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,000
to work from so that over the next 10

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
years and a couple years from now i can

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,840
start stabilizing those lines the ones

99
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
that i like the most

100
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,878
do some things where i you know final

101
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
hunt and find some really nice unique

102
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,079
ones and make feminized versions of

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,598
those for people

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,799
but try to eventually get to where i've

105
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,238
got about maybe a dozen ibl versions or

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,439
close to that

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,120
and that's my long long term goal

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,439
but that's stuff that will

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
you know we're talking at least 10 years

110
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,199
beyond that for me to just get a few

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
things available at that point that's

112
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,560
awesome though man you got plans already

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,599
to take what your father bestowed upon

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,640
you and put your own signature on it i

115
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,280
love that

116
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,639
i love it i want to take a step back

117
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
really quick

118
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
because you just said something that i

119
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,719
hadn't heard from you before

120
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,359
and that's that your family didn't know

121
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,120
it as romulan right

122
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,280
what did you know

123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,039
so it was just basically because back in

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
the day there weren't really when i was

125
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,478
growing up and this was in the 70s and

126
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,160
the 80s

127
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,839
you didn't really have as many names for

128
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
mud it was really about the location

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,359
where it was from you know it was maui

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
wowie and a few exceptions but right for

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
the most part you were talking about you

132
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,040
know alcohol gold or colombian red and

133
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,120
it was called red because the hairs were

134
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
red or gold because the hairs were gold

135
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
and where it came from and this was

136
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
called pine bud

137
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,319
and there was a mountain nearby where i

138
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
grew up called pine mountain so some

139
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,360
people would call it pine mountain bud

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
people that were close to my father

141
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,879
would call it g-dubs bugs those were the

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
initials but it was mainly because it

143
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,319
smelled like pine and nothing else some

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,439
people just referred to it as the pine

145
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,199
bud

146
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,439
that's awesome man because that's

147
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,919
exactly how i came to know it before the

148
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,879
name romulan came by was port alberni

149
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,719
pine but that's what we always right

150
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,719
and when i when i when i first got into

151
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
this i didn't know about

152
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
that that was stuff that i had to learn

153
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,239
early on getting into this and talking

154
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
to people and they said you know there's

155
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
a much deeper history than what you can

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,399
kind of just look into on the internet

157
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,079
and then i started talking to my my uh

158
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,599
pop's friend that was that hadn't passed

159
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,719
yet and getting more information from

160
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,080
him and

161
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,919
and that was where i learned a lot more

162
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,599
about about all of this because

163
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,000
initially it was just that wow i know

164
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,439
this plant's great it's fantastic i gave

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
it to some friends

166
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,639
and then the word coming back was i mean

167
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,478
it's it's a lot more than that and

168
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,918
people don't really have this anymore so

169
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,079
you have to try to get it to as many

170
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,918
people as you can did that so it went

171
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,599
from just a burden

172
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,439
it did you know it went from this really

173
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,919
kind of small thing like you know no big

174
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,918
deal like i'm sure i can keep it alive

175
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,359
you know and i've got i've got my dad's

176
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,799
friend that i at the time he was still

177
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
alive and i you know i can talk to him

178
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
and he can tell me what to do if i've

179
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
got questions and it was real you know

180
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,719
carefree you know and i remember my

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
first harvest and i think it and i just

182
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,639
was floored at how good it was

183
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,240
and you know okay this is i'm gonna keep

184
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,840
doing this this is great this is kind of

185
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,918
what i've wanted to do my whole life is

186
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,560
have my own grow that no one [ __ ] with

187
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,639
and

188
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
so i can definitely do this and then as

189
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,519
soon as i started giving some of the

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
flower to friends

191
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,799
then people started asking me for the

192
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,079
cut and i started giving that to them

193
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
and then you know month down the road

194
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,879
they were coming back to me saying you

195
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,519
can't just keep this to yourself

196
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,759
you have to you have to get this out so

197
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,599
yeah the burden really kind of got heavy

198
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
at that point because i knew that wasn't

199
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
something i was

200
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
prepared or wanted to do or capable of

201
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,159
at all

202
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
and i started just giving it away to

203
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,439
people and i

204
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
was on forums and eventually people said

205
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,759
oh you know go on instagram and i got on

206
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,360
instagram and i was trying to find you

207
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,960
know people that wanted it that had the

208
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
biggest grows that i could find on there

209
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,198
you know big outdoor grows and stuff and

210
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,879
people that were in california as local

211
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
to me as i could find

212
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,439
and i eventually got to give it to their

213
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
nursery and i gifted it to them and i

214
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,240
remember and i kind of had this fantasy

215
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,360
that you know it's only going to take

216
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,519
them a couple months and they're going

217
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
to be clones are going to be everywhere

218
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,758
and it was years later before they even

219
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,679
did their initial release

220
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,360
during that time i had people asking you

221
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,918
know can i get seeds from you can i

222
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
study i have some old ones but i don't

223
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,159
really want to give them away this is

224
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,680
all i have for my dad and so it doesn't

225
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,759
really go well with me

226
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,120
how old are you and uh when he passed

227
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
that cut to you

228
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,879
this was in 2015.

229
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,799
so yeah i'm damn near 50 now okay

230
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,478
so it was it wasn't that long ago when

231
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,199
he actually passed it to me but i grew

232
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,918
up around it and i was i can literally

233
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,840
remember in my diapers

234
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,038
it was it was around before i was born

235
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,959
so right

236
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,800
well you said it was a long-term project

237
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,680
between a lot of guys

238
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,478
yeah

239
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,478
so

240
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,918
did you have any growing experience

241
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,120
prior to your dad giving you this cut

242
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,079
i had

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,399
not

244
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,399
all on my own i had grown up around

245
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,839
growing and cultivating and i'd helped a

246
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,918
lot of friends

247
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,399
do things various different growth

248
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,560
outdoor closets all that kind of stuff

249
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,159
many many times but i had never it was

250
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
never my grow it was never from

251
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
beginning to end

252
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,879
no one else was doing it it was always

253
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
just kind of i'm coming over to a

254
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,120
friend's house and we're doing this

255
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
together

256
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
at best or it was i'm giving him advice

257
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,478
you know

258
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,759
so it wasn't really

259
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,519
ever my

260
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
grow and it it

261
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,639
there were several well i was involved

262
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
enough where it was you know this is our

263
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
pot and everything you know me and my

264
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,560
friend were saying how we grew this but

265
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,278
it was never my own and it never felt

266
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,079
like

267
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,120
i knew what i was doing so whoa that's

268
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,038
it

269
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,038
was such a burden then

270
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,559
yeah exactly you know i had a decent

271
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,519
amount of knowledge and i had a lot of

272
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,879
access to everything i needed to know

273
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,480
but at the time i

274
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,600
i knew enough to get started that was

275
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
about it

276
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
right

277
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
so

278
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
now

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
you're kind of down the line for a while

280
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,159
you did an awesome job at preserving

281
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,480
those genetics i guess they

282
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,199
and now you're hybridizing all these

283
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,278
things to find new things to hunt

284
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,399
through to kind of take that romulan

285
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,879
staple and put your own signature moves

286
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,600
on it and i love that i gotta say that

287
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,679
fritter bomb that you made recently

288
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
if you would have caught me any other

289
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,639
time

290
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,399
i would have just called [ __ ] like

291
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,439
with a lot of cookie stuff i usually

292
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
call [ __ ] but we do our hype strain

293
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
reviews

294
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,159
and on our hype strain reviews we did

295
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,480
smoke that apple fritter and that was

296
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,399
one of maybe three of the hype strains

297
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
that i've ever smoked that i was like

298
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
that one's actually really decent

299
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,639
yeah

300
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,399
and uh love that's lumpy's who who made

301
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,559
that and he's pretty local to me here

302
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,799
too so that that one was special to me

303
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,559
that katsu chose that because it was

304
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,879
it's a guy that's you know i don't know

305
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,439
him personally but he's not far from me

306
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,679
and i think he created that in 2010 or

307
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,920
2012 it's been around here for a long

308
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,439
time and it's just now starting to

309
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,599
become this big hype thing so it's been

310
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
really cool to watch that process

311
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
so that one was really special to me and

312
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,959
i was fingers crossed that that was

313
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,199
going to turn out good and it

314
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,319
blew my mind how good it actually turned

315
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,839
out

316
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
if you've smoked apple fritter you know

317
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,360
it's it's pretty potent stuff oh yeah

318
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,440
and the two of them together is it's uh

319
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,639
it's real good and the taste is amazing

320
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
i think a lot of people that are kind of

321
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,799
chirp chasers and flavors are going to

322
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,199
love it just because of that but because

323
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,159
it's so potent and so strong

324
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,959
how did it get you right your profile

325
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,399
it's not exactly the same as it smells

326
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,639
you know a lot of things though

327
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
but it it's got a real good sweetness to

328
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,039
it

329
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,959
and it's kind of

330
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,039
the best way i can describe the smoke

331
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,599
because for me i have a harder time

332
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,719
pointing down flavors than i do smell

333
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,240
it's kind of like smoking a sweet candy

334
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,639
that's got some

335
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
kind of cushy piney

336
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,000
ganja type you know

337
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,360
flavor in the background to it but it

338
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,958
really it's like it's almost like

339
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
smoking candy it's

340
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,239
i'm trying not to dip back into it and

341
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,159
smoke some other stuff because when i

342
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,639
get stuff that's that tasty i

343
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,639
i'll smoke an ounce every few days and i

344
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,639
can't see it like that that's too much

345
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,720
preserve it a little bit yeah i'll just

346
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,759
be sitting on my couch like a zombie 24

347
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
7.

348
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,120
so let me ask you

349
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,959
when you were looking at putting your

350
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
own signature on this

351
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,919
and finding

352
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,439
things that you were going to breed with

353
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,519
the romulan

354
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,680
what were the boxes that you had like

355
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,440
what were you looking for

356
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,239
so that one's real easy i want romulan

357
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
that

358
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
tastes different i want to be able to

359
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,839
have some options to smoke

360
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
different tastes

361
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,880
i love raw meal and i smoke it all the

362
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
time i smoke it every day i've been

363
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,879
smoking it for years straight and i

364
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,919
never tire of it but it's nice to smoke

365
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,838
stuff that tastes a little different

366
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,439
every now and then right most the stuff

367
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,120
that i go out and get or i get from

368
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
friends or i grow myself that is a

369
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,879
totally different profile

370
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,799
i don't really like smoking it i like

371
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,078
the taste of it but i you know 10

372
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,319
minutes after i smoke it i'll go and

373
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,838
smoke the omule because

374
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
that's the high that i want to feel i

375
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
don't want to feel whatever it was that

376
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,879
i just smoked right

377
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
so that's the first

378
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,439
category of that is make a bunch of

379
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,519
things try to at least

380
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
that affect me just like romulan does

381
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,320
but have a different taste to it

382
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,319
different smell

383
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
and then i want to have

384
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
after that i want to have things that

385
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,078
are more far more sativa leaning or far

386
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
more into cleaning i want to have stuff

387
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,799
that's you know

388
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
better for her if i just want to zonk

389
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,120
the hell out or watch a movie or yeah be

390
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,360
really couch-locked yeah oh you know

391
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,039
more stuff where i you know i want to be

392
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
almost like i'm on amphetamines or

393
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,719
something you know cleaning my house

394
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,039
mowing my own and doing everything right

395
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,959
yeah i want to have that broad spectrum

396
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,559
because i like everything that that

397
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,919
there is within the cannabis world for

398
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,719
smoking

399
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,879
so

400
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
first this flavors and trying to stick

401
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,679
with stuff that hits me just like

402
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,480
romulan and then it's that kind of stuff

403
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,159
that's

404
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,159
it's close to the romulan effect that i

405
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,759
can get but leads far more in one

406
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,000
direction than the other

407
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,919
no this is why you and i have always got

408
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
along is because you're very [ __ ]

409
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,679
real with what you say

410
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,440
you're not trying to promote yourself

411
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,039
out of nowhere you're just telling it

412
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
how it is and the fact that you're

413
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,240
working

414
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,919
with romulan in this way

415
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,959
because it's something that you love to

416
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,199
smoke

417
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,559
and you want to take that to different

418
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
lengths that are still going to work

419
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,759
good for you specifically that means

420
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,079
that you're breeding for what you

421
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,078
like and you're actually putting that

422
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,759
intent in it and that's going to come

423
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,199
forward in your work

424
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,278
i hope so

425
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,040
i can't remember all of them

426
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,559
you know i go through so many seeds all

427
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,679
the [ __ ] time i got so many friends

428
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,759
that do this

429
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,078
i forgot everything that you had to

430
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,159
crossed the romulan with

431
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,519
what all did you pick other than the

432
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,559
apple fritter

433
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
so

434
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,679
for the cats who collab

435
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,679
that's uh he he made those selections

436
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,120
that was all his choices

437
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,958
i think he may have

438
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
tried to choose things that

439
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,759
he knew i would be interested in like

440
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,480
two because he did make a lot of

441
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,319
selections right up my alley and in fact

442
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,759
several of two or three of the things

443
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,199
that he crossed with he didn't know what

444
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,360
i was doing at the time and we made the

445
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,198
exact same cross we both made a road

446
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
kill skunk and romeo and cross we both

447
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,879
made a great vape in romeo and cross

448
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,120
and that was one i think one other thing

449
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,639
we both did the exact same thing

450
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,679
and on one or two of them i think the

451
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,360
grapevine we were using the same cuts so

452
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,278
we were literally making the same cross

453
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
the roadkill skunk i hunted mine from

454
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,039
seed

455
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,480
that i got from copycat which was i know

456
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,559
some people have issues with that and i

457
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,879
don't really give a [ __ ] i had some

458
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,319
people i highly respect said

459
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,919
it doesn't it doesn't matter what what

460
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,519
you hear about him if you're going to

461
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,679
grow something of his and you like the

462
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,198
old school [ __ ] get his vocals and it

463
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,638
was a guy that's been growing for 30 or

464
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,799
40 years that told me that and then

465
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,399
someone else repeated it it didn't have

466
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,599
quite as much cred in my in my world but

467
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,360
it was yeah i heard it from several

468
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,839
people and i went okay yeah i'm gonna

469
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,240
get it and they were right it was legit

470
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
and it was fantastic and i found one

471
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
that was

472
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,439
the one that i chose was not quite uh

473
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
the skunkiest

474
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,920
that wasn't the best selection in that

475
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,920
area but it had a really nice structure

476
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,439
had a really massive yield to it

477
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,120
compared to the other ones

478
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
and it didn't have as much of a

479
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,480
branching issue or anything it didn't

480
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,399
need any support so that was my

481
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,278
collection because it was a real nice

482
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
reader

483
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,799
i wasn't going after it just for the

484
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
skunk profile

485
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,919
that's awesome i really appreciate

486
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,919
strong branching

487
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,320
list they want a good structure

488
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,399
but like if all the progeny you know

489
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,800
they're either weak and limpy or strong

490
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,120
they don't really mind too much

491
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,879
and it makes it a lot less work when

492
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,039
you've got something that yields really

493
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,879
nice that's not flopping all over its

494
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,240
[ __ ] self needs to be managed on a

495
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,120
daily basis

496
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,360
yeah

497
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,679
i can't help because of my personality

498
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,320
with being kind of ocd with my growth

499
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,000
when i'm doing them and so i'm in there

500
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
almost every when i'm breeding i'm in

501
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,799
there every day checking every single

502
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,559
plant

503
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,639
looking trying to literally with my

504
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,239
eyeballs and hands look at every node

505
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,879
every portion of it going over the whole

506
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
plant to make sure nothing's going wrong

507
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,278
nothing's you know

508
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
and

509
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,799
if you trellis things and have all kinds

510
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,278
of supporting that gets to be a huge

511
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,679
pain in the ass to even get in and

512
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,198
prune and trim and things like that so i

513
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,198
can't stand

514
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,639
the fact when my romulan cut is it's a

515
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,078
pain in the ass and that in that sense

516
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
you have to support it you have to

517
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,799
trellis it in almost every type of

518
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,040
throat

519
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,039
and it's a lot of work in that sense and

520
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,559
so i try to when i'm reading with it i

521
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,879
already know that that's an issue so i

522
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,439
try to choose things that are gonna not

523
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,399
continue that as much as possible

524
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
awesome

525
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,399
exactly that's exactly what you want to

526
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,799
do is you know with every

527
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,519
outcrossing that you do you want to take

528
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,000
what you already had and make it better

529
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,278
the point isn't to go backwards so the

530
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,519
fact that you're breeding for those

531
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,559
weaknesses within it that really shows

532
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,720
your passion i appreciate that thank you

533
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,159
so it's the learning process and

534
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
i kind of thought getting into all this

535
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,559
breeding stuff i was like you know

536
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,078
there'll be some

537
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,918
some failures i'm sure i've heard that

538
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,000
you know but i figure probably most of

539
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
the stuff because if i choose right most

540
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
stuff i make will be will be great you

541
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,000
know

542
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,520
it's been like maybe a third 30 25 of

543
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,279
what i've made has been

544
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,838
okay now this actually is stuff that i

545
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,759
can i can sell for people

546
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,159
we're going to take a short break and we

547
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:28,549
will be right back with romney and jake

548
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:32,269
of romulan genetics stay tuned

549
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,269
[Applause]

550
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,599
hey guys while we're on short break i

551
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,918
wanted to give a quick shout out to one

552
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,439
of my favorite sponsors one of the best

553
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,240
affiliates that we have on the show

554
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,120
coconut sensors you guys can find them

555
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,120
over on ig over at coconut inc where you

556
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:52,159
can find their website at

557
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,918
www.coconaut.com that's k-o-k-o-n-a-u-t

558
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,480
dot com

559
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,880
i believe their sensors retail at sixty

560
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,038
nine dollars each and it's such a cool

561
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,840
little device guys i cannot praise them

562
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,279
enough i use them in all of my rooms

563
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,079
especially at that price you can't

564
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,160
really beat it they are battery operated

565
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,079
the batteries have never ran out on me

566
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
and i've been using them for over a year

567
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,399
now i believe i heard that the batteries

568
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,879
can last in them for up to two and a

569
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,120
half years but that comes with the price

570
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,679
point what coconut does it's a pretty

571
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,000
amazing little device you can get an app

572
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,480
that works with it on google play

573
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,720
you can get it on the apple store

574
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,640
but what it does is it connects your

575
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,319
climate data

576
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,759
to your hands so you can tell what's

577
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,480
going on in your environment if you need

578
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,720
to go away for a while if you need to

579
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,319
take a vacation whatever you know what's

580
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,000
going on inside your grow room and it'll

581
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,038
help you keep track of keeping

582
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,359
everything

583
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,759
where it needs to be within vpd values

584
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,000
is pretty amazing it tracks it you can

585
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,319
bump it you can find it you can refresh

586
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,079
it at any point and see where your

587
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,839
humidity levels are at where your

588
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,678
temperature is at and where your vpd's

589
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,000
at it's a pretty damn handy little tool

590
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,840
you can add multiple sensors on the same

591
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,599
app so you can check your bedroom you

592
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,759
can check your clones your seedlings

593
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,879
your mother's your flower room whatever

594
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,279
you need to do

595
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,640
awesome awesome guys awesome retail

596
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,798
value i cannot

597
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
say enough good things about them i

598
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,879
heard they are also going to be

599
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,038
incorporating co2 as well soon so i'm

600
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,559
very much looking forward to that i

601
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:27,759
believe that is going to be a bit higher

602
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:30,319
price but not much not much at all but

603
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,640
with the co2 i believe he said it was

604
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,119
going to be running a higher power so it

605
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,000
is actually going to have to use a wall

606
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,079
plug on that one either way we love them

607
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,919
we support them won the best sensors who

608
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,359
won the best price points if you guys

609
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
aren't looking to go out there and spend

610
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,079
300 on a sensor but you do want to keep

611
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,159
control of your of your climate in

612
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,399
different grow rooms i would highly

613
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,519
suggest coconut sensors go give them a

614
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,480
follow over there that's

615
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,359
coconut.com one more time

616
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,360
www.coconut.com or you can find them on

617
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,519
ig at coconut inc

618
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:07,839
huge shout out and let's get it back to

619
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,839
our episode with romulan genetics

620
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,079
[Applause]

621
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
all right we're back with romulan

622
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,480
genetics before we left we were talking

623
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,558
about some of the

624
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,038
people that you were collabing with like

625
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,200
katsu you did the release with katsu

626
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,640
who else were you thinking about clavin

627
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
with

628
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,799
i've talked quite a few people and i've

629
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,759
for a while since i started this i've

630
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:33,519
had a

631
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,440
short specific with the people that i

632
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,079
wanted to work with katsu was on that

633
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,159
list before him and i even taught me

634
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,960
so i was really excited to work with him

635
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
and

636
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,558
that's turned out to be pretty amazing

637
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,079
because you know i see what most

638
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,839
breeders do with a collab and they make

639
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,279
maybe one or two strains and that's

640
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,279
their collaboration and then they move

641
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,879
on with their lives to other things

642
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,558
and that's what katsu and i were going

643
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
to do and it ended up turning into

644
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,038
really big projects and ongoing and

645
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,798
years worth of releases and

646
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,720
we're talking about doing more things

647
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,798
and so it's it's almost becoming more of

648
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,079
a a long-term partnership and a

649
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,079
collaboration

650
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,319
and he knows a lot so i'm learning a lot

651
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,079
from it too and getting to see

652
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,519
crosses with stuff that i've wanted to

653
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,918
see for years

654
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,000
and he just went and did it and got it

655
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,200
done and i get to see it so it's really

656
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
[ __ ] cool

657
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,558
but i did that with him and i'm talking

658
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,240
with

659
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,960
13 hills

660
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,558
in ufo genetics i think those might be

661
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,079
the next ones i don't know exactly if

662
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,839
both of them are going to happen or

663
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,678
what's going to happen with them because

664
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,959
we didn't get too deep into specifics

665
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,519
with it and it's been a little while

666
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,159
since i talked to ufo genetics but i

667
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,759
recently got my cut into

668
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,039
paul's hand he's the guy who runs

669
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,558
nuclear speed bank and he's uh

670
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,400
really good friends with a guy from 13

671
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,399
hills and the guy from ufo genetics so

672
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
he's going to try to then get my cut

673
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,880
into their hands because they're

674
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,240
and uh so those should be the next two

675
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
people that i'll be

676
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,519
doing one with hopefully if things go

677
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,240
well

678
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,679
i've talked extensively to gage green

679
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,519
group but it's been about a year since

680
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
i've talked to them and we never really

681
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,519
got into specifics

682
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,678
i haven't heard we didn't talk a while

683
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,359
yeah i was thinking the same thing

684
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,720
they've just kind of just kind of been

685
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,038
quiet for a bit hopefully that means

686
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,159
they're hard at work yeah and i'm sure

687
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,480
it does

688
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,280
but i've talked to them several times i

689
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,759
talked to uh ethos a little bit and both

690
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,839
of those i was pretty excited about so

691
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,079
you know i hope to maybe one day get

692
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,399
talking to them again about things

693
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,319
i think that's it as far as like what

694
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
will actually happen

695
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,639
there have been several other contacts

696
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
from from other people that things

697
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400
probably won't happen because i just

698
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,798
you can only do so many things at once

699
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,280
you know yeah you can't fight too many

700
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,279
wars on different fronts you know

701
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,119
well so some people can it's you know

702
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,678
but i don't i'm not the kind of person

703
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,359
that will ever i'll never be dropping

704
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
two or three new strains every couple

705
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,599
weeks i'll i'll never do that you know

706
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,399
on a consistent basis for years some

707
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,240
people

708
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,080
drop things like that and that's

709
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,120
that's not how i work so

710
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,199
yeah i like smaller batches just so i

711
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,279
can really pay attention to those few

712
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,960
you know and try to take on too many

713
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,558
projects and your mind starts going all

714
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,120
over the place and becomes a little bit

715
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,519
fuzzy yeah i usually try to

716
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,879
i try to stick to it to one or two and

717
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,558
that's how i've done most things in the

718
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
past i just recently bumped it up and

719
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,399
did like a five different crosses at

720
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,839
once rig feed stuff

721
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
it was a little bit too much for me i

722
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,678
didn't like it so

723
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
i probably won't do that that many again

724
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,159
so it's too hectic having having to pay

725
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,000
as close attention as i do to all the

726
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,760
different plants and when they're all

727
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,839
different that's harder to do you kind

728
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,599
of have to like go wrote a row type

729
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,959
thing and a lot of times my plants will

730
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,558
get mixed up so i'll be like look trying

731
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,558
to look at the tag stick with the same

732
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,000
cultivar for until i get through them

733
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,678
and then move to another one but then

734
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,038
that gets too hard to do

735
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,000
she's paying me

736
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,599
yeah no i hear that man for sure so out

737
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,400
of all these collabs that you did with

738
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:03,678
katsu what would you say were the top

739
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,840
three that you personally you were like

740
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,440
i really appreciate this one

741
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,839
so we did the first one was a year ago

742
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,759
and it was a feminized speed line and he

743
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,119
did basically about the same thing that

744
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,480
we did with this

745
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,839
current release coming up with the

746
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,720
regular

747
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,599
he did like a dozen different cultivars

748
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,278
he reversed my romulan and let that dust

749
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,038
all these these things he'd been growing

750
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,240
for a while and working with

751
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,240
and

752
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,400
several of those

753
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,159
he we hardly got any seeds from it we

754
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,440
didn't get very much at all and there

755
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,080
were oh there was only enough from two

756
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,000
of them to release any so we released

757
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,278
old school dank which is kind of like

758
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,960
white romulan

759
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,519
it's the white ramen

760
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,558
and then we were released

761
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,480
yeah

762
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,319
and then we released uh space field

763
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,079
which is east coast tower diesel and

764
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,879
romulan and both of those were

765
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,319
top notch just fantastic but we didn't

766
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,960
have that many packs we didn't have that

767
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,879
many feet it was pretty limited release

768
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,120
i still have several packs of myself

769
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,720
that i kept my ball that stuff was

770
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,479
really really good but there were 10

771
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,558
other cultivars that no one really got

772
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
to see or smoke and i think only a few

773
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,759
testers got some stuff from katsu and

774
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,720
most of them were fantastic there was a

775
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,519
black line bubba kush in romulan that

776
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,038
was

777
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,200
about the most potent stuff i've ever

778
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,558
smoked i mean it would like feel like i

779
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
got hit in the head with a frying pan

780
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,038
and then i would just basically pass out

781
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,038
10 minutes

782
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,759
yeah you know i guess if you if you get

783
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,200
home from a hard day's work or something

784
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,480
that's exactly what you're looking for

785
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,759
oh yeah oh yeah

786
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,839
sometimes

787
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,119
but it was it was just remarkable on how

788
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,199
potent it was

789
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,479
and its taste was really good too

790
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
but there were several of those things

791
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,798
on the regular seed thing that

792
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,799
i just test ran and i'm smoking all the

793
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,798
stuff of it now and there's a few

794
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,440
there's two that haven't quite finished

795
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,200
up their long-winded 12-plus squeakers

796
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,960
so i'm waiting for those before i can

797
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,558
talk about those but

798
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,159
the fritter bomb

799
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,000
is probably

800
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
for what's going on in the industry

801
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,359
right now is probably the best one of

802
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,440
those that would be what i would pick

803
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,839
with number one if i'm trying to appease

804
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,919
everyone with my selection it's not my

805
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,038
own personal number one

806
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,880
but it's

807
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,798
the easiest to grow

808
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,400
just about the highest yielder in that

809
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,319
room and i ran

810
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
12 different cultivars

811
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,639
it was really really high yields uh

812
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,400
really pretty plant really frost covered

813
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,919
really potent really tasty you know just

814
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,360
kind of crossed all the different boxes

815
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,480
off that people look for these days it

816
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,558
looked really exotic and [ __ ] like that

817
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,599
that one was probably the number one

818
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,720
the

819
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,719
right now number two for me is

820
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,919
vapor trails which is the roadkill skunk

821
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,038
and romulan

822
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,440
because

823
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,839
it's got that old school flavor to it

824
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,480
and it's extremely potent on the indica

825
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,439
side and i don't smoke a lot of

826
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,120
harder indica [ __ ] it's i just try to

827
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,320
when i have stuff like that i only smoke

828
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,678
it at night

829
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,200
so it just doesn't feel like i'm smoking

830
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,880
that much of it because all day long i'm

831
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
smoking romulan from about an hour after

832
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,440
i wake up

833
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,278
until i go to bed and it's sometimes

834
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,120
i'll smoke a bowl every 10 minutes

835
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,359
that's nice i smoke a lot

836
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,798
yeah you know i smoke a lot a hell of a

837
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,319
lot and

838
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,000
sometimes i feel like i have to because

839
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,759
i have so much weed on me

840
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,119
that i have to keep smoking that much

841
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,158
because otherwise you know what how am i

842
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,359
going to do it it's eventually going to

843
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,278
go bad

844
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,079
well yeah i was going to say something

845
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,079
there but i can't

846
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,240
put a marker there

847
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,038
it's a pin in that one so

848
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,839
yeah

849
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,798
vapor trails number two and

850
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,038
probably the stocks which is u-dub and

851
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,839
romulan that'd be my number three wow

852
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,079
nice and that's because

853
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,278
yeah and that's because my choices are

854
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,519
kind of going to be a little different

855
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,798
like the head dip is awesome

856
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,240
that's how i've been in romulan

857
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,038
all of them are really good that's the

858
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
thing

859
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,119
they're all so good that it's kind of

860
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,240
hard to really choose and so most of

861
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,319
them it's like

862
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,798
well this is a lot like that parent or

863
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,960
this parent and so it doesn't impress me

864
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,038
as much as the ones that are

865
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,720
very unique in their own right

866
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,240
the ones that came out much more like a

867
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,079
true f1

868
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,079
are the ones that i've got my eye on

869
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,759
it's like wow those are special those

870
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,839
are really cool because when you look at

871
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,158
both parents they're coming out as

872
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,558
pretty evenly as something in between a

873
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,919
mesh of the two and quite unique and the

874
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,720
stonks is

875
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,038
really really special saying that f1 the

876
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,120
blend between both parents is very

877
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,359
dominant in that

878
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,119
yes exactly

879
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,959
yeah whereas

880
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,558
most of the other stuff it was

881
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,798
that things were in one direction or the

882
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,158
other there really wasn't as many

883
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,759
phenos that showed up that were in

884
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,360
between you know it was a really nice

885
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,558
mixture of the two parents that's most

886
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,000
civil war

887
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,759
that you can tell that leans more

888
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,159
towards romulan or you can tell that

889
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,759
lean leans more towards atmosphere

890
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,080
just as an example that's not a good

891
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,079
example

892
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,639
so yeah and the stonks one was really

893
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,798
interesting because there was a really

894
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,120
off smaller plant that

895
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,918
finished really fast and i got to smoke

896
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,519
it early on and it tasted exactly like

897
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,200
great blunt wraps

898
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,918
nice like really strongly so when you

899
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,679
smoked a bowl of it in a glass piece

900
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,278
it did this really strange thing with

901
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,278
your head where you're like

902
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,200
am i smoking blood wraps like i don't

903
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,119
understand what's going on here

904
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,278
and people in the room too like i the

905
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,479
first bowl i smoked i blew out and uh

906
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,159
someone walked in the room and they're

907
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,038
like are you so good i'm bloody here you

908
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,960
know

909
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,798
it's just sweet

910
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
everybody has a different perception of

911
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,480
what something tastes or smells like you

912
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,839
know

913
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,960
some of those and it is it is

914
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,639
interesting

915
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
it is interesting to see because i i do

916
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,038
get some people that have grown my

917
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,399
romulan cut and specifically my cut

918
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,679
they've got it from dark heart nursery

919
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:58,479
and every now and then i get someone

920
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,159
that

921
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,319
they're like oh it tastes you know

922
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,480
creamy vanilla it's something totally

923
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,960
different than what everyone else tastes

924
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,240
and i'm like i'm like really and can i

925
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,679
see a picture of the girl and they show

926
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,599
me a picture and it looks fantastic they

927
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,519
did a great job and i'm like they must

928
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,918
just have kind of like a different

929
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,440
you know yeah profile with the way that

930
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,080
their body takes it in

931
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
oh i remember what that when i did my

932
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,879
first and it was it was horrible i

933
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,480
didn't have a handout right off the bat

934
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,000
you know nobody gave me any cuts

935
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,798
everything i had i had to work from seed

936
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,880
but the very first cross i did

937
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,759
i just was not happy with it by the time

938
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,600
we got to f3 it just wasn't stable

939
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,679
but we i think i saw you talking about

940
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,000
that but we had all the testers growing

941
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,798
them out and it was very heavy on the

942
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,038
skunk side of its family

943
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,720
and all the testers by the time we came

944
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,519
to harvest they were saying oh it's

945
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,440
really really earthy skunky

946
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,359
or it was there was some like sweet

947
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,519
skunky phenotypes but everything was

948
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,119
like overall very skunky

949
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
it had a little bit of hawaiian in it so

950
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:08,000
you get that too but we had one duster

951
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,000
that said it tastes like mint i was like

952
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,240
is it dragged it's totally awesome it's

953
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,798
just totally off the wall it throws you

954
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,359
off too you're like oh [ __ ] really

955
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,278
i mean you know you went pretty far off

956
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,199
the spectrum

957
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,119
yeah one guy had me hunting for like a

958
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
female that i wasn't gonna find in mine

959
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,639
for a while that was weird

960
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,080
oh no then

961
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,600
we got talking about we got talking

962
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,278
about something else and he goes he goes

963
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,719
yeah this tasted like this to me and i'm

964
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,720
like what

965
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,759
wait a minute you know that's everyone's

966
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,000
smoking it

967
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,278
it was it wasn't lg it wasn't og but it

968
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,798
was something like that where everyone

969
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,798
universally says this is what it tastes

970
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,000
like you know and he was like nah no

971
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,599
it's totally different for me but i'm

972
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,519
like that with so many with so many

973
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,119
strings so many things and i was like oh

974
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,240
sh yeah okay

975
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,918
well i'm gonna start a new one out here

976
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
that sucks man

977
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,480
so how long were you hunting for that

978
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,159
one

979
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
it had been like uh

980
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,760
i was probably three gross so like nine

981
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,599
months

982
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,200
i made a cross one of the first early

983
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,000
things i did i never released it was the

984
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,159
hog with romulan and it was insane i

985
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,398
remember it was really really good but

986
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,799
it had a very high intersex weight it

987
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,798
was like 30 somewhere around there

988
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,398
and so i couldn't release it so i was

989
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,480
trying to hunt through it and find

990
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,639
better things but i had had people that

991
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,960
did test grows and they were like no

some of the best stuff i've ever had and

996
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,960
one guy

997
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,720
because i i wanted to call it alien

998
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,240
bacon once i realized i was going to

999
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,679
cross them i just kind of had that name

1000
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,000
stuck in my brain

1001
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,720
and one guy said no [ __ ] i have a fino

1002
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,480
that tastes like bacon and i was like i

1003
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,000
gotta find that

1004
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,399
so that's what happened i was looking

1005
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,319
for this bacon you know and it was there

1006
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,319
was no bacon pinots to be found there

1007
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,079
wasn't anything close to it i just i

1008
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,519
kept looking now thinking yeah i'd be

1009
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,759

1042

reading and stuff throughout my life and

1045
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,519
and my beliefs are very [ __ ]

1046
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,960
let me start with what i believe in okay

1047
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,838
so i believe

1048
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,918
that

1049
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,599
i'm a christian and i believe that most

1050
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,759
of what's written in the bible all that

1051
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,720
what in the bible is true most of it is

1052
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,040
interpreted truly that's the best way to

1053
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,759
explain it but you don't want me to have

1054
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,320
a podcast today

1055
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,240
but no no no no listen

1056
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,240
this is this is important and you can

1057
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,319
air any of this i don't care i studied

1058
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,678
orthodox christianity and what what i

1059
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,679
was taught

1060
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,679
by the people who was teaching me in

1061
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,480
orthodox christianity which is an older

1062
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,200
form of christianity right is that

1063
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,079
there is room within christianity and

1064
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:52,158
believing in god and all of that for

1065
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,320
bigfoots ghosts aliens wormholes portals

1066
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,000
time travel [ __ ] anything

1067
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,000
anything because

1068
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,358
god created everything and as humans we

1069
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,760
shouldn't question what was created amen

1070
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,920
we should examine it and

1071
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,160
do our best to interpret it and all

1072
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,240
these things but we should not ignore it

1073
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,239
we should not deny it and we should not

1074
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,838
question it because if he created it

1075
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,639
it's not our job to question what he's

1076
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,159
made and that was one of the first

1077
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,759
meetings i had and this was kind of

1078
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,039
something i was being forced into i was

1079
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
going into a marriage and they said you

1080
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,159
have to be a christian

1081
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,160
so i was going into it a little

1082
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,838
hesitantly and i asked him these

1083
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,920
questions and i said what about these

1084
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,440
things because i've read the bible i do

1085
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,920
believe a lot of it but there are some

1086
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
issues i have and i explained my issues

1087
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,559
and he said well

1088
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,160
most people look at that the wrong way

1089
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,679
because they don't realize with god

1090
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,039
there is no time

1091
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,879
so a lot of what you're reading that's

1092
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,119
being explained is time isn't kind how

1093
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,760
we see him that's how he sees you oh

1094
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,960
yeah so maybe a day can you build a

1095
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,960
million years

1096
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
maybe it's a billion years can you get a

1097
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,720
date

1098
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,880
right so he's like a lot of people don't

1099
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,399
realize that in reading it and they they

1100
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,039
misinterpret things and they take it the

1101
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,760
wrong way they take it too literally

1102
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,358
so i have spent my whole life studying

1103
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,320
all these different things and i firmly

1104
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:12,319
believe i've seen ufos i've had

1105
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,320
very dramatic bigfoot encounters

1106
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,240
anybody not where people would have been

1107
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,880
there's no other explanation that i can

1108
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,319
plausibly come up with because it wasn't

1109
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,358
people i was dealing with that were in

1110
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,680
the forest

1111
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,838
next to my property my dog was going

1112
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,879
nuts my dog that doesn't bark at people

1113
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,039
ever

1114
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,200
never loses his mind and he was going

1115
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,039
ape [ __ ] oh no

1116
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,679
and there was something moving in the

1117
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,519
bushes about five feet from my fence and

1118
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,879
it's a fence this wrought iron you can

1119
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,480
feed through it

1120
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,519
and i couldn't see what the hell was

1121
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,559
there

1122
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,639
and

1123
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,480
then something else moved 15 feet away

1124
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,400
to the right then something else moved

1125
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,920
way over here and i knew it there was

1126
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,760
now i'm dealing with multiple things

1127
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,559
because that one thing didn't move it's

1128
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
still there making noise and so i

1129
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,679
started talking and thinking it was

1130
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
people

1131
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,199
and i got no response nothing

1132
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,399
and

1133
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:22,159
i'm armed and so i pick up a rock

1134
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,480
and i throw it high arc up in the air to

1135
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,960
try to have it land behind

1136
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,599
whatever is out there to hopefully get

1137
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,519
them to at least make a movement so i

1138
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,880
can better know whatever's out there

1139
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,000
where it is

1140
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,079
and as soon as the rock landed a rock

1141
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,599
hit right next to me there's a huge pine

1142
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,880
tree that's like

1143
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,480
you know you can't even put your arms

1144
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,480
around it dig around

1145
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,960
a big rock hit the tree right next to my

1146
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,639
head about 16 inches 18 inches from my

1147
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,480
head and bounced off the tree right

1148
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,559
behind me almost hit me

1149
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,320
so it happened any bigfoot

1150
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,159
that's the only thing that's the only

1151
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,320
thing i come up with because um you know

1152
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,759
i turned on the light after that at that

1153
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,079
point i really kind of got scared

1154
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,560
shitless yeah and i started shining

1155
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,200
flashlights and spotlights and there was

1156
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,400
nothing there and it's not it it's hard

1157
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,439
for me to explain but it's not a place

1158
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
where people

1159
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,480
would be

1160
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,760
it could possibly be but it's not a

1161
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,880
place where people would be and they

1162
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,119
certainly wouldn't be there at two

1163
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,760
o'clock in the morning a group of them

1164
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,680
without flashlights without anything and

1165
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,760
able to move from the area without

1166
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,598
making as much noise as

1167
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,760
ever there's all kinds of sticks and

1168
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,200
branches and whatever was there moved

1169
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,160
away silently

1170
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,799
it just

1171
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,559
wasn't there anymore i heard very

1172
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,599
minimal movement that i knew it was

1173
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,880
moving and then it just wasn't there

1174
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,039
i don't know how to explain it was

1175
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
either a ghost that threw a rock at me

1176
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,800
and many of them that were just [ __ ]

1177
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,880
with me and my dog could see him and it

1178
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,839
made the whole property smell weird

1179
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,800
or it was bigfoot

1180
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:56,320
no i just love how like dead on serious

1181
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,720
you are right there or it was big

1182
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,960
yep i had other people here that was

1183
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,679
that was witness to it with me and

1184
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,639
yeah don't let me know

1185
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:09,279
i mean everybody has [ __ ] encounters

1186
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,279
of some kind or like i'm just the worst

1187
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,440
[ __ ] skeptic and it's probably

1188
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,800
because you and i both have that ocd

1189
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,200
problem

1190
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,320
yeah but yeah i'm the worst skeptic ever

1191
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,000
and i try to explain everything and yes

1192
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,000
i get that because i've been down that

1193
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,119
road the opposite way and like i've had

1194
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,119
i've seen pans fly across rooms before

1195
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,320
just all kinds it's a long story i'm

1196
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,599
going to have to tell you about that

1197
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,119
sometime

1198
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,760
i actually went to college at what had

1199
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,240
been recreated from a old mental

1200
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,320
hospital and they turned into a college

1201
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,358
and there was just some crazy [ __ ] that

1202
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,559
happened there

1203
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,000
but even miss c like she loves ghosts

1204
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,519
and she's like and you don't believe in

1205
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,838
ghosts and i'm like a ghost would

1206
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,838
literally have to walk up to me and say

1207
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,759
what

1208
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,358
up you know i'd be like all right you're

1209
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,160
real

1210
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,318
yeah but yeah i get there like that it's

1211
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,318
just like there's no explaining that you

1212
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,880
know like seeing a knife

1213
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:12,318
go off a three foot counter through my

1214
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,838
buddy's uh rubber boot

1215
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,079
oh jesus yeah you don't have enough

1216
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,599
velocity to do that no

1217
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,760
yeah and once you've seen something like

1218
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,079
predators it's you're like you know okay

1219
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,000
how do i explain that yeah

1220
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,839
so anyway we talk about cannabis

1221
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,760
sometimes right

1222
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,400
yeah yeah let's just get back on subject

1223
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,800
too let me this is what happens when the

1224
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,358
weed you're smoking is too good

1225
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,119
that's good way off track at least it

1226
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:38,559
means we're smoking good stuff because

1227
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,838
you and i are both in this i love it

1228
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,159
this is by far one of my favorite

1229
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,759
podcasts i've ever done i feel like

1230
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,199
we're sitting on opposite couches in the

1231
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,800
same room yeah

1232
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,719
that's how it should be that's how it

1233
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,280
should be that's how i've always done it

1234
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,239
uh even back on when we did like all the

1235
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,240
ig live shows that's all it was we were

1236
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,118
just sitting there smoking talking about

1237
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,559
weed with everybody and it should always

1238
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,119
be like that that's what i love that's

1239
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,639
my passion it works that way yeah that's

1240
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,880
how it flows you know

1241
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,799
it reminds me of you know my younger

1242
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,000
days just going over to friends houses

1243
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
friends coming over to your house just

1244
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,440
to smoke you know

1245
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,519
you'd sit there for hours just plain low

1246
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,880
in the background just chatting laughing

1247
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:21,039
that's what i'm shooting about

1248
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,880
so i did want to ask you one question

1249
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,599
that we always ask

1250
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,519
all of our all of our guests

1251
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,079
and this one i'm super interested in

1252
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,000
because there's a few options now from

1253
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,200
what you've said that you have to pick

1254
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,039
through but we always say if there's one

1255
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,279
i don't like to say strain anymore i

1256
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:42,400
hate saying strain i've been saying type

1257
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,079
cultivar type variety yeah

1258
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,280
cultivar uh

1259
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,160
well i think cultivar more as like

1260
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,240
not a type i i find a type is more like

1261
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,879
your fritter bron footer bomb crossed

1262
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,719
with romney one and then like your cut

1263
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,838
would be the cultivar right

1264
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,519
yeah like that that's that's that's

1265
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,440
so hot on

1266
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,960
okay

1267
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,200
you know i didn't question myself all

1268
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,960
the [ __ ] time so i don't know

1269
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,118
i agree we're gonna get technical about

1270
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,920
it that's that's spot on yeah

1271
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,000
so i like to ask people you know

1272
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,838
out of everything that you have

1273
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,239
everything that you work with

1274
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,960
if there was one type

1275
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,078
to represent your company and what your

1276
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,000
goals are

1277
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,839
what would you say it was

1278
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,199
one to represent romulan

1279
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:34,000
genetics oh jesus

1280
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,118
the tough questions

1281
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,960
i mean

1282
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,358
i could obviously just be easily saying

1283
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,760
well ramen you know this is my favorite

1284
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,799
and i smoke me one time right but you're

1285
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,200
putting your own signature

1286
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,920
i'm torn between i'm torn between two

1287
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,799
okay

1288
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,800
one is communion that i made and i made

1289
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,318
a rig seed and a feminized version of it

1290
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,160
i don't think i ever released the reg c

1291
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,559
version because that's i want to work

1292
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,440
that further before i do any releases of

1293
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,838
that but that one was

1294
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,838
really really good and i i put a lot of

1295
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,000
work into it i started by crossing two

1296
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,639
other things first and working those and

1297
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,280
then crossed that with romulan

1298
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,318
time to do that yeah it was a great

1299
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,560
stomper og and durbin poison if i'm i'm

1300
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,759
remembering right if people are reading

1301
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,920
my website or something right now going

1302
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,599
no it wasn't then i'm sorry i have a bad

1303
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,559
memory

1304
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,318
that's what it was i've liked both of

1305
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,920
those and i was excited just to cross

1306
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,599
those two together

1307
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,200
for some structural things i wanted to

1308
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,119
see if i could bring over that the

1309
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,159
trichome production of

1310
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,160
and the

1311
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,159
the bud siphon stuff from

1312
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,239
the gravestomper into the turban poison

1313
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,480
because that's just a gorgeous plant to

1314
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,519
me and i love growing what about this

1315
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,039
flavor

1316
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,800
i love the flavor too

1317
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,960
it's great i mean anything that's

1318
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,720
anything that's older is just right up

1319
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,400
my alley you know

1320
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,318
basically if you get to if you go

1321
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,760
through the history of cannabis once you

1322
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,279
get to headband that's kind of where i

1323
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,720
started checking out on

1324
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,240
these things tastes great to me

1325
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,399
everything after that just wasn't as

1326
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,639
good as the older [ __ ] mm-hmm

1327
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,960
so i said there was so between

1328
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,039
between between the communion which was

1329
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,079
that okay and that came out with a

1330
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,358
really good grape candy or a wine kind

1331
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,599
of flavor

1332
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,159
and it was just delicious really really

1333
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,240
potent but a nice like

1334
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,598
you could chill on it and you know relax

1335
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,118
the indica high but it wasn't like going

1336
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,800
to put you to sleep

1337
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,960
so i i spent a lot of times listening to

1338
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
albums and stuff smoking that and i tore

1339
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,440
through

1340
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,280
i think i had like a

1341
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,960
half pound of it and i smoked it in a

1342
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,400
couple weeks or something it was just a

1343
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,559
stupid short amount of time that i

1344
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,400
smoked all this weed to myself

1345
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,880
that one was really great but the first

1346
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,559
thing that i made it ended up it started

1347
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,280
as a poly hybrid project it ended up

1348
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,759
being a double poly hybrid i made

1349
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,519
called it ring of fire i got a feminized

1350
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,880
release and i did a f1 release and

1351
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:59,759
that one probably best represent

1352
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,039
stands for who i am and what i do that's

1353
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,560
awesome

1354
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,159
that was

1355
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,759
yeah i'm gonna work that further and

1356
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:09,039
release uh like an f4 f5 if i get antsy

1357
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,720
if i don't get anthony and i can be

1358
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,920
patient it'll be an ibl by the time i

1359
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:12,799
release it again

1360
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,480
good

1361
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,160
but that who knows how long that could

1362
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,599
take me because there can be setbacks

1363
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,838
and all that [ __ ]

1364
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,599
so that one i think best represents me

1365
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,400
because of the fact that that's the

1366
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,800
first real thing that i made

1367
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,800
that's what i set out to make

1368
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,960
and i ended up with a double poly hybrid

1369
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,920
which if you know about breathing those

1370
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,240
that's it's far more complicated far

1371
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,838
more complicated the more things you do

1372
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,759
when you're doing that and

1373
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,279
it was it was all over the place i had

1374
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,720
so many clones i didn't know what the

1375
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,160
hell to do with them

1376
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,519
at one point i was i mean i was

1377
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,879
jam-packed

1378
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,358
and

1379
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,640
that was how i wanted to start learning

1380
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,159
to do this

1381
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,960
was to try to

1382
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,239
get the most difficult stuff

1383
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,358
out of the way

1384
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:59,598
first

1385
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,598
so that everything else wouldn't be

1386
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,200
a challenge in a sense it would it would

1387
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,079
be enjoyable

1388
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,159
and it

1389
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,079
i'm really proud of that creation it was

1390
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,159
something i spent a lot of time on and i

1391
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,760
didn't i was like a secret i didn't tell

1392
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,799
anyone for a long long time what i was

1393
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,400
doing

1394
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,000
and then when i finally released it i

1395
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,760
kind of did it all without much notice

1396
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,440
when i first dropped it

1397
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,560
and did like a real limited release at

1398
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,838
first and

1399
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:22,960
gave it out to a bunch of people as

1400
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,199
testers

1401
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,159
that one i think best represents

1402
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,399
what i do and what i want to do because

1403
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,719
if you've grown it and smoked it the

1404
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,240
feedback i've got from from everyone is

1405
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,838
they absolutely love it there's a lot of

1406
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,000
people that have keepers they found and

1407
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,719
that's what they continue to grow

1408
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,800
it was a really really good thing

1409
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:43,919
it was a really really really good smoke

1410
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,079
and um

1411
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,159
i know i'm like sitting here going back

1412
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,760
i know some of that i can see

1413
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,519
but i think that's probably the one that

1414
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,680
the best represents me

1415
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,880
communion i would say also is there

1416
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,919
because

1417
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,519
a lot of the stuff that i will be doing

1418
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,838
not so much as a personal project for me

1419
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,079
is going to be like that the stuff that

1420
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,759
i try to appease people with is going to

1421
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,240
be more like community

1422
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,319
the stuff that what i want is going to

1423
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,639
be more like ring of fire it's going to

1424
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,318
be stuff that may be unruly to trim it

1425
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,159
may be a pain in the ass to grow but i'm

1426
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,279
not going to care about that because my

1427
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,679
ultimate

1428
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,359
i can grow something it's fine i care

1429
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,960
about how it smells that's

1430
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,199
nothing else matters i don't care what

1431
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,720
color the leaves turn that's stupid they

1432
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,799
trim off anyway

1433
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,959
you know so i only care about what it

1434
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,400
smokes like and ring of fire was it was

1435
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,079
finicky it was she was painting the ass

1436
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,760
to grow she was a super painting they

1437
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,880
have to trim their leaves and frost

1438
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
everywhere

1439
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,640
but the smoke made it all worth it

1440
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,640
so

1441
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,799
but i do try to do a lot of stuff

1442
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,719
because i have people that are close to

1443
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,599
me friends and stuff that say you know

1444
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:53,358
hey you crossed these will you do that

1445
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,599
so there are some things that i i'm

1446
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,519
choosing and working things through i

1447
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,760
made a mac one and it runs across with

1448
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,759
romulan i crossed the mac one of the

1449
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,119
runs together first and worked those and

1450
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,800
made a selection

1451
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,720
and then i crossed my romulan and i'm

1452
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,839
calling it burning cap and that's a

1453
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,959
strain that i'm probably going to be

1454
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,000
releasing

1455
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,199
somewhere within six months from now

1456
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,880
and i did that project solely because i

1457
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,598
had pressure from like three close

1458
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,000
friends to work with those two cultivars

1459
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,359
and work it with romulan and

1460
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,119
two different people were specifically

1461
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,358
one was asking for mac one was asking

1462
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,960
for runs so i said [ __ ] it i'll make

1463
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,719
them both happy and i'll start by

1464
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,119
crossing those together and then i'll

1465
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,118
cross that with romulan and uh i think

1466
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,880
it turned out pretty good

1467
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,280
yeah i think it turned out pretty good

1468
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,400
but i never would have done that

1469
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,319
at all if it wasn't for people asking me

1470
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,838
if it wasn't for some of my followers

1471
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,960
saying you know hey i would love to see

1472
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:48,960
a month and run

1473
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,839
people wouldn't even know about it if i

1474
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,000
wasn't yeah so that's all that matters

1475
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,239
there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of

1476
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,519
stuff i've scratched that you know like

1477
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,838
for example i didn't like it when i

1478
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,519
crossed just romulan with mac one i

1479
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,519
thought that might turn out okay because

1480
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,679
i thought it would look good and it did

1481
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,079
okay so you did try it out across it

1482
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,078
yeah

1483
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,760
that plant sucked and the smoke sucked

1484
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,318
in my opinion it just

1485
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,000
i would be saying the same thing if

1486
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,159
those people who

1487
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,318
could be offended were in the same room

1488
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,879
yeah you'd be staying in in front of

1489
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,639
[ __ ] respect

1490
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,760
it's a lot easier when it's that way

1491
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,358
because you know when someone gets

1492
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,720
offended you can explain yourself and be

1493
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,400
like you know i'll apologize and all

1494
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,919
that if you can't fix it yeah but i

1495
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,519
don't want i don't want to make your day

1496
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,920
harder

1497
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,519
yeah no i know i've been i've been

1498
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,039
dealing with that long enough now where

1499
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,079
it doesn't really trouble me as much

1500
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,838
anymore

1501
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,079
especially when it comes to time and i

1502
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,000
still don't want to [ __ ] deal with it

1503
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,400
the offending people drama thing has

1504
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,559
gone very well for me lately when it's

1505
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,639
happened i had a dojo seed stone ninja

1506
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,319
he put a post up i didn't know about it

1507
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,598
people were like oh my god coming at me

1508
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:06,960
talking all this [ __ ] i'm like what the

1509
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,318
hell is going on

1510
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,240
and they're like you can't call this

1511
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,880
strange uh cold stone because he had

1512
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,399
made a strain name of old stuff yeah

1513
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,599
we didn't know about it i think it was

1514
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,760
him and i

1515
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,200
yeah and he just put a post up and he

1516
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,280
wasn't trying to start [ __ ] he even said

1517
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,558
that in his post but it his followers

1518
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,880
blew up on

1519
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,720
and i got all his backlash and so then

1520
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,599
i'm like hey hey brother i sent him a dm

1521
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:28,959
and we just started chatting and

1522
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,119
everything was totally cool right off

1523
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,559
the bat and he was a great guy and i'm

1524
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,079
like we'll just change the name it's not

1525
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,440
a big deal we haven't you know it's

1526
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,280
months from release doesn't even have a

1527
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,800
date yet and he's like cool cool no

1528
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,880
worries i mean you can keep the name if

1529
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,800
you want i don't really even care

1530
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,400
so he was super chill and everything

1531
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,000
worked out fine we just changed the name

1532
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,838
and there was like no drama but for a

1533
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,199
couple days on instagram

1534
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,119
it was you would have thought you know

1535
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:51,919
someone's grandmother

1536
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,280
so

1537
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,400
let's end this how are we going to end

1538
