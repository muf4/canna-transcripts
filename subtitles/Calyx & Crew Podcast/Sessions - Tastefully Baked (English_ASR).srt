about you guys why don't you tell us how

18
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,158
you first each individually CU I'm sure

19
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,759
it was a different a different story but

20
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,880
each individually how you guys first got

21
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,879
introduced to cannabis yeah so um

22
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,319
basically I started in high school to

23
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:51,438
replace my Aderall um like a lot of my

24
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,438
friends did just to trade it for weed

25
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,319
and um yeah it's basically

26
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,158
self-medicate mainly because everybody

27
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,559
didn't want me to and it and it helped

28
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,240
made me hungry so um yeah from there um

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,240
I went off and learned how to weld and

30
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,598
hated it um so then I decided to go surf

31
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,359
in Hawaii and figure out what I was

32
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,199
going to do met a guy who actually was

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
up your way um you know grown in a

34
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,439
warehouse and ended up getting out of it

35
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,598
and moved to Hawaii and sold all his

36
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,680
stuff so he kind of you know planted the

37
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,518
seed in my head um ended up going back

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,599
East um you know trying to figure out

39
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,360
how to grow uh ran into you know a

40
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,878
couple people up North Carolina

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,200
Mountains that you know really taught me

42
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:37,518
some things and then um that's kind of

43
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,959
when yeah we kind connected your life I

44
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,439
had never consumed cannabis it was

45
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,878
completely foreign concept really to me

46
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,359
at that point in time I think it was

47
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,840
what like 19 yeah so then I went down

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,040
for a trip to visit him because we had

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,400
started dating at the time and I was

50
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:57,039
still living in New Hampshire

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,400
and yeah kind of just

52
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,158
was I'm trying to even like think of how

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,158
I want want to describe it but it was

54
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:05,079
just kind of went down there and he had

55
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,239
had something that he had to tell me

56
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,400
before I kind of went into the house had

57
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,158
no idea because I had no idea about any

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,360
of this yeah so you know you figure you

59
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,759
like fly down spend a whole you know day

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,000
and then all of a sudden you get there

61
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,039
and he's just like so before you go into

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,598
my house there's something I think um

63
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,120
you should know and I'm like okay what

64
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,959
he's like well I have some you know some

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
plants upstairs in the you know in the

66
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,199
spare bedroom I'm like okay

67
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,479
that's cool I don't care and then I say

68
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,719
that was probably my first time ever

69
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:41,199
consuming weed was uh during that trip

70
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,199
down there y yep hit up basically every

71
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,238
grocery store that had the free little

72
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,479
samples for you to go ahead and grab

73
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,239
food so what was your first experience

74
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,798
with did you guys just smoke a join

75
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,759
or um I think we were smoking bongs

76
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,760

77
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:00,039
Northern Light blueberry cross if I

78
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,519

Aderall with it you didn't like how the

82
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,878

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,158
getting more relief with the Cannabis

84
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,560

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,918

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,240
Tastefully baked where did the idea for

99
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,039
Tastefully Baked come from the idea for

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,680
Tastefully baked came from when we ended

101
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:57,719
up yeah we moved to Maine after we got

102
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,840
in a little bit of trouble in New

103
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Hampshire um and then yeah we kind of

104
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,198
needed something you know to call our

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Creations we knew we wanted to get back

106
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,079
into cannabis after the ordeal that we

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,639
went through in New Hampshire was more

108
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,279
so just trying to figure out like

109
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,600
logistically how you're going to you

110
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,239
know make that move make that jump um

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,039
happen let's cover that really quick

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
what happened over in New Hampshire for

113
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:23,199
everybody that doesn't

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
know in what

115
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,159
2000 2013

116
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,839
2013 we

117
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,360
were in inded on a bunch of charges for

118
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,839
cultivating and what they distribute to

119
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,759
distribute to distribute uh cannabis so

120
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:44,239
we were raided by the drug task force

121
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,840
went through the whole entire ordeal

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,199
that is New Hampshire is very stri

123
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,239
prosecuted it it was it was a big deal

124
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,000
it was all over the papers um all in the

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,639
news we were you know going to court

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,600
every week we had you know High bail and

127
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,038
stuff like that so we were basically

128
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,240
looking at spending the rest of our

129
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,959
adult lives and and State prison and

130
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,800
then go into federal prison for some

131
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,560
guns that we had at the house um on

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,400
weapons charges after that so it was

133
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,439
either fight the whole thing um or take

134
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:15,758
a plea and just you know take 10 years

135
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:18,079
and go go take a long uh trip away so we

136
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,520
decided to fight it got you know got a

137
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,159
really good attorney and we ended up uh

138
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,598
proving that they lied to the judge to

139
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,680
get the search warrant which made them

140
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:28,879
have to throw out all the evidence so

141
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,120
took about a year to fight quite a bit

142
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,478
of stress

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,399
um you know lot of money lots of stress

144
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,120
lots of money lots money

145
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,519
really on the judicial system yeah we

146
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,240
had to cancel our wedding it was it was

147
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,519
it was hard on our families I that was

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,079
probably the hardest thing was putting

149
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,719
my mom and dad through it yeah that was

150
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,159
the worst her her family that that was

151
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,960
the hardest part

152
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,280
um a

153
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,719
lot want to do that again so we figured

154
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,758
out you know we're going to go do it the

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,400
right way as as best as you can don't

156
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,400
don't upset the mother-in-law

157
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,758
exactly we got we got the DEA don't

158
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,240
worry about that but not the

159
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,919
Mother-in-law exactly that's awesome so

160
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,840
you guys went from your indictment there

161
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,758
and fighting that into going up to

162
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,439

166
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,878
quick I believe uh I believe Janelle's

167
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,759
drinking one too

168
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,479
right now but you have these amazing ju

169
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:40,038
Juiced infusions and they're 50 migrs a

170
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:43,360
piece right yeah how do you guys go

171
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,598
about infusing a drink like that I've

172
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,639
been wanting to talk to in Edibles

173
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,120
expert for a very long time about this

174
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,720
I've had infused seltzers before but

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,959
coming from a homeg grow perspective

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,599
where we make a lot of cookies and

177
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,399
brownies and gummies and like you know

178
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:04,279
simple to make stuff at home uh the

179
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:06,279
concept of infused Seltzer is something

180
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,559
I can't even fathom how do you guys go

181
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,038
about that process so for like

182
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,759
background um our company we do

183
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,878
cultivation we do extraction and we also

184
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,439
obviously make our own cannabis infused

185
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,158
products um we like to have hands kind

186
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,800
of on into everything that goes into our

187
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,519
product so we can make sure that

188
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,720
everything is up to to our caliber um so

189
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,758
it really all starts obviously in the

190
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,960
garden

191
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,038
and then it heads over to my husband and

192
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:39,038
he does the extraction

193
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:41,679
um so yeah basically for the celer we do

194
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,278
um we take like a full spectrum extract

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,039
and then we strip everything out of it

196
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,039
except for the THC so we basically do

197
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,919
like a full chromatography column scrub

198
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,719
on it and take it so it's completely

199
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:56,278
flavorless um and then we homogenize it

200
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,759
at a really really really high RPM yeah

201
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,958
there's a certain um I guess I would say

202
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,278
certain recipe that I've figured out

203
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,919
over the past probably what did probably

204
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,159
nine months of yeah nine months R&amp;D

205
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,039
research to try and create something

206
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,519
that would be water soluble so there was

207
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,319
that whole back end and then kind of

208
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,480
once I figured out the recipe for it we

209
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,879
just kind of um ran with it the main

210
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,039
reason why we personally have decided to

211
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,720
take out basically everything that could

212
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,240
taste like vegetative growth or any sort

213
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,759
of Flav Flor that resembles that of the

214
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,480
cannabis plant it's just I personally

215
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:39,319
don't like to consume Edibles that taste

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
like cannabis if I wanted that then I

217
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,360
would have like a juice or something

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,200
else but this is for more so for the

219
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,399
palette that doesn't want it to taste

220
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,920
like cannabis gotcha yeah it depends I

221
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,759
think there's some things that it pairs

222
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,559
well with and then there's a lot of

223
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,039
things that it just tastes like weedy on

224
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
top of whatever you got you know so

225
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,480
there's a time and place I think for

226
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,759
everything um from my personal

227
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,879
perspective of just doing Edibles and

228
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,679
food infusions over the years so you're

229
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:11,958
saying after you extract all the

230
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:15,078
thca uh that in itself is water

231
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,958
soluble the thca is not you have to

232
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,559
break it down basically into Nano

233
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,919
particles um okay and then yeah then you

234
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,119
mix it with a carrier you basically have

235
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,120
to homogenize it into an intermediary

236
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000
liquid that gets mixed into you know the

237
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,360
bright tank basically a brewery style

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,559
tank like a big

239
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,839
tank um then it gets carbonated um goes

240
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,439
through the can every we can and then it

241
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,880
has to go back to the lab um for for lab

242
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,320
testing like I mentioned earlier you

243
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,120
guys have the passion orange guava and

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
you sent me a lemonade too is that the

245
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,959
only two flavors or is there more than

246
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,040
that they have a sour blue Ras as well

247
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,479
and a tropical punch and then we have

248
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,159
something else we're kind of working on

249
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,560
behind the scenes that we'll hopefully

250
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,360
be ready in the next

251
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,319
3 to six months damn you guys hear that

252
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
all new flavors coming out you said blue

253
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,040
raspberry and now yeah I think I got to

254
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,599
put in we got to make a main trip here

255

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,198
certificate of analysis for that

278
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,879
particular product I would love to know

279
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,240
where you guys' dose is 100 milligrams

280
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,679
is like I don't know if I don't do

281
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,240
enough edibl but that's a top for me and

282
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,958
I smoke all day every day but 100

283
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,480
milligrams really gets me there where

284
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,799
are you guys at I'm about 50 we'll

285
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,360
generally split one of those y it's

286
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,879
pretty it's relatively Rich so we'll

287
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,199
we'll generally split it but yeah our

288
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,879
Market here as far as Edibles and

289
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:52,198
infusions is high dose very high

290
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,820
dose that's what I was going to get into

291
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:55,039
with that

292
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,240
[Laughter]

293
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,958
bar one of these what goes into making

294
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,639
this how much much time does it actually

295
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:05,239
take to make a camasi cheesecake but

296
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,759
those are definitely a labor of love and

297
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,240
more so a passion uh project at the end

298
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,159
of the day I do them

299
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,839
because I really just enjoy trying to

300
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:20,240
create a flavorful experience with

301
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,959
cannabis um so that consists of three

302
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,360
different layers the first layer that

303
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:27,239
you have is the calaman pat toi so a

304
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,320
calaman is a mixture of between like an

305
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,680
orange and a lime and they're

306
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,120
predominantly grown in like really

307
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,078
tropical climate so I think the

308
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,600
Philippines is a very common place where

309
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,838
you can find them so you have to make

310
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,879
that layer lay it all out let it sit

311
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,399
overnight then the following day you

312
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,639
need to frame out your next layer to put

313
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,278
on top so for this one is a white

314
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,278
chocolate cheesecake

315
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,759
ganache which is absolutely delicious so

316
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,679
then you throw that on

317
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,800
top and then you need to wait again for

318
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,799
the following day basically and then I

319
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,198
finished it off with a graham cracker

320
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,078
cheesecake ganache so most of the

321
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:12,559
ingredients that we source to I try and

322
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,758
find either anything local as far as

323
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:19,000
local agriculture we have a lot of local

324
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,959
dairy farms um local or organic is

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,919
really where where our focus is at the

326
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,479
end of the day all the chocolate that we

327
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,159
use um is sourc from companies that

328
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,079
don't use child slave labor for their

329
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,039
caca heart harvesting so once you go

330
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,039
down that rabbit hole it really wants to

331
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,519
you know make you stay straight on your

332
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,240
morals once you start learning all the

333
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,198
nitty-gritty about the chocolate

334
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
industry so that's really also kind of

335
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,000
our thought process behind everything

336
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
that we try and create we try and be

337
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,159
conscious of the various um places that

338
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,519
we Source our ingredients then the you

339
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,319
have to wait till the following day back

340
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,759
to making this so then the following day

341
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
is when we end up actually cutting it

342
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,039
and then we let it again sit out until

343
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,879
till the following day it gets an

344
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,719
enrobed drizzled and then we need to

345
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,000
wait for the test results to come in for

346
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,839
us to package it up and have it to over

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,198
to the patients so is everything on that

348
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,680
bar infused or is it a simple part of it

349
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:20,439
that is I have figured out more so which

350
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,919
um parts of the recipe are easier for me

351
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,320
to infuse to keep the dose

352
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,039
accurate easiest way to keep the dosage

353
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,240
accurate throughout everything so on

354
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:32,039
that bar in particular is the

355
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,839
pad to that's infused which some people

356
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,439
I found out who are like you know gluten

357
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,800
intolerant they're like okay I'll just

358
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,079
have as long as I know the pieces that

359
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,479
I'm eating that are infused I'll just

360
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:45,078
leave at the gram cracker so that's kind

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:49,959
of funny too now this thing is 100

362
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:53,838
gr Chocolate Bar says milk chocolate

363
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,838
1,500 migr per

364
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,920
bar that's ridiculous guys like the

365
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,078
other thing other part of our

366
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,879
demographic too is also you know the the

367
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,479
health conscious part that wants a high

368
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,838
dose but doesn't want to consume a bunch

369
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,240
of sugar and a bunch of chocolate or you

370
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,880
have the people with a very high

371
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,480
tolerance those are kind of like you

372
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,519
know the two patients that where we have

373
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,639
in mind when we create something like

374
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,919
that fair enough fair enough I I've just

375
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,480
you know when I get into a chocolate bar

376
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,519
I'm not going to stop at the first

377
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,720
couple bites

378
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,078
so I feel like that for me would be an

379
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,920
Allin or allout thing but, 1500

380
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,758
milligrams I don't know if I could do

381
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,399
that oh

382
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,639
yeah oh we should definitely ask him

383
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,639
about that Panda says I'm at over

384
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,399
9,000 wow so and I've heard about this

385
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,120
before people that don't process Edibles

386
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,159
the same way that other people do is

387
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,159
that something that you guys have

388
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,078
experienced not personally but with

389
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,120
various you know stories from patients

390
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,318
most

391
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
definitely it's funny I've heard from a

392
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,918
lot you know a lot of people who are

393
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,279
super heavy concentrate consumers smoke

394
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,600
flour all day long they have five

395
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:15,720
milligrams of exactly like no way yeah

396
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,318

397
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,640
and you know flower all day type of guy

398
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:24,119
I do I appreciate flower more but I take

399
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,959
dabs more throughout the day just

400
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,798
because I'm so busy all the time and

401
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,600
it's very convenient to be in and out

402
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:34,038
and done you know or take an edible and

403
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:37,038
let that ride out for sure but still

404
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:39,599
with that tolerance level 100 milligram

405
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,440
drink will just I think the last time I

406
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,119
did 100 milligram drink I was on a hay

407
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,519
ride about Halloween time and I was just

408
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,798
spacing out on every animal that we went

409
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,720
by it was horrible I mean it wasn't

410
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,480
horrible it was amazing but you know it

411
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,200
was

412
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,279
unexpected with your infusions on the

413
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,240
chocolate bars are these I've seen some

414
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,960
on your page that you break open they're

415
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,798
like car Ral

416
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,919
fil is that what this is or is it just

417
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,960
strictly a regular chocolate bar that is

418
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,640
just a solid piece of chocolate okay so

419
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,120
you guys have a few different options

420
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,240
when it comes to your chocolate bars

421
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,558
then we do a lot of uh limited kind of

422
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,200
releases it allows us to be creative

423
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,639
with things that are in season it allows

424
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,600
us to do you know stuff out of the

425
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,440
necessary production Norm so we get to

426
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,079
use you know our brains a little bit

427
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,798
more than just trying to be cogs in a

of cuts through all of it totally

463
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,158
different than anything and it all mixes

464
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,880
and combines very well and then right at

465
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,240

huge say I mean there's nothing like

482
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,000
opening up you know your inbox or your

483
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
DMs and having messages from patients

484

through in the past and just the you

491
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,640

regulated business yeah it's very over

494
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,600
regulated business um that makes it all

495
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,200
worth it at the end of the day no peer

496
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:33,319
pressure guys come on like I've got [ __ ]

497
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,400

498
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,558

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,919
will say showing great

500
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:44,079
restraint out of all

501
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,038
the pieces of art that you guys do

502
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,918
through your culinary work which seems

503
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,919
to be the most

504
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,600
popular I feel like there's the are

505
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,640
Staples but then the patients really get

506

our Staples to keep them

510
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,360
occupied while we're over here trying to

511
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,960
figure out what we're going to concoct

512
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,278
for like the next tasting experience so

513
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,600

00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:22,839
things yes that's awesome that's really

515
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,759
cool can can we get any insight about

516
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,639
something that might be coming up

517
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,759
here I mean we like we have our like

518
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,840
conf ction bar line like you have we've

519
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,480
kind of themed that so we'll do like

520
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,119
different drops different flavor

521
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,798
combinations throughout the season

522
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,798
depending upon what it is um Christmas a

523
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,240
Christmas staple for us is like a bon

524
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:45,639
bon five piece variety um assortment of

525
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,480
whatever we come up with Valentine's Day

526
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,440
again for us is like another huge bon

527
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,278
bon um event because everyone likes to

528
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,679
gift each other chocolate of course for

529
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:57,480
Valentine's Day so we tend to more so

530
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,960
stick with like the certain you know

531
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,480
themed items but really change up the

532
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,679
flavors depending upon either what you

533
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,480
know inspired us or whatever maybe in

534
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,519
season or some sort of holiday flavor it

535
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,278
really

536
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:14,679
varies would it be fair to say that you

537
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:17,599
guys favorite consumption method is

538
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,360
Edibles I like flour personally I smoke

539
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:23,879
flour most of the day

540
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:26,359
um I find edes are a great like

541
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,000
nighttime thing they're they're great if

542
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,278
you want a wonderful seamless night

543
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,720
sleep to not be interrupted by anything

544
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:37,000
or anyone but as far as for like daytime

545
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,839
consumption for me flowers where it's

546
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,079
at definitely a flower guy too I think

547
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,720
most people in chat will agree oh I see

548
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,960
cad popping up just want to hug them

549
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,240
they've done so well yeah definitely and

550
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,480
your packaging is off the chart guys

551
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,120
like it really pops so and we've talked

552
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
about this many times before there's

553
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:01,239
companies that make kind of of an

554
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,079
inferior product and I'm not going to

555
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,960
say who cookies uh I'm not going to say

556
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:11,199
who but they throw it in a package that

557
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,319
pops and it's basically like putting

558
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,480
makeup on a pig there's nothing behind

559
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,879
it what you guys have done there's

560
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,480
definitely an incredible product inside

561
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,320
of that case and it's wrapped in a

562
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,640
beautiful rapper so this something that

563
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,439
you guys can expect you can go over to

564
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,200
Tastefully baked.com and see all their

565

567
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,038
besides chocolate bars drinks and uh

568
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,880
these probably I would say probably our

569
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,079
Vape cards would be our next next in

570
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,960
line we do like offer Vape card like a

571
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,599
cured res like a cured resin um it's

572
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,319
like a low ohm more like a nicotine

573
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,558
style Vape that like blows a bigger

574
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,639
Cloud it's higher voltage type of deal

575
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:58,158
oh right those are super popular let me

576
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,120
ask Corey first uh Corey if I had to ask

577
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,159
you top three strains of all time what

578
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,759
would you

579
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,240
say um we had this discussion the other

580
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,319
day a little bit that's kind of funny

581
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,440
probably number one would be

582
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,519
headband

583
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,679
um probably number two would be one that

584
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:19,119
we just got from the guys over at DNA

585
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:21,240
recently which is a GMO kosher Kos cross

586
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,000
um really almost smells like a skunky

587
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,278
kind of like Thanksgiving dinner it's

588
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,480
really weird um definitely have to be

589
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,319
into like some weird weird TPS to like

590
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,640
it

591
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,960
um but it's one of those things that

592
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,480
people just get really obsessed with

593
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,240
once they actually smell it really kind

594
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,480
of a skunky background but definitely

595
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,440
some Thanksgiving Vibes

596
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,200
um and then maybe like the original

597
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
gorilla go I like really gassy stuff um

598
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,480
really offensive kind of TPS for me

599
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,199
personally going to say I'm seeing a

600
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,200
pattern here

601
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,919
yeah yeah I Vibe with that I love a

602
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,679
little bit of everything but I am more

603
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,600
into the accurate stuff for sure yeah so

604
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,919
Janelle how about you what would be your

605
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:07,158
top three o I'd go

606
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,640

607
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:13,760
that's a it's a classic I I just the

608
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,600
perfect kind of go-to smoke of the

609
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:20,879
day then I would probably go with what

610
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:22,398
do we have LA LA Confidential yeah la la

611
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,440

Woman way back and that just took you on

613
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,558
an

614
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,480
interesting borderline scary borderline

615
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:34,200
borderline kind of psychedelic

616
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:37,038
experience so that really yeah that was

617
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,038
a really really good one yeah yep

618
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:42,038

619
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:45,599

remember I can't remember for the life

623
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,919

624
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,919
say our headband that we had so how was

625
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,799
it

626
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,038
psychedelic it just kind of put you in

627
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,798
this made you really think different

628
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,960
sort of way I can't even like your brain

629
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:09,079
was

630
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,079
just in a

631
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,759
pulsating

632
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,439
distorted and it made your top three

633
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,278
though

634
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,200
yeah yeah I love it I love that Martian

635
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:22,278

um we have a smaller Garden so we kind

659
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,479
of cycle through streams we'll run them

660
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,278
for a little while and then we'll kind

661
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,960
of we're always kind of feno hunting

662
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:41,000
something different and then always

663
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,679
cycling stuff out okay so whatever that

664
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
run produce that's what's going on as

665
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,720
long as we find something better we'll

666
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,480
retire what isn't quite as good and

667
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,240
we'll keep a keep a few going and we'll

668
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,759
just kind of have a competition for for

669
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,120
Real Estate so what do you think is the

670
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,919
future of Tastefully bake do you guys

671
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,038
have like a 10-year goal what would you

672
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:03,440
like to see Tastefully B become how can

673
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:07,240
we progress more from where it is right

674
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,320
now um I mean a lot of a lot of that

675
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,440
stuff's can you can have a vision it's

676
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,678
just always a little bit hard to make

677
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,000
it to know I guess how the legal path is

678
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,679
going to pave its way over the next 10

679
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
years that makes that's probably the

680
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,720
most challenging thing about planning a

681
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,319
growth for a cannabis business and

682
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,880
trying to kind of figure out how you

683
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,558
want to go about it if you're to you

684
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,120
know expand Beyond state lines are you

685
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,319
going to want to do it in you know the

686
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,079
MSO type method or you going to want to

687
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:39,278
do it more in like a multi-state brand

688
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,599
type way and I think that's super

689
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,159
individual um for everyone depending

690
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,119
upon whatever workload or whatever

691
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,760
they're kind of deciding to invest but I

692
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:51,798
think um really just focusing

693
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:54,919
on creating things to

694
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,720
be I mean in the future I I see us more

695
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,120
so pivoting towards honestly a

696
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,839
greenhouse model um than the way that we

697
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,719
currently have things set up but again

698
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,480
that takes you know time for brand to

699
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,480
grow and there's a lot of Old Farms we

700
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,960
want to grab an Old Farm and like you

701
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,200
know have a have a greenhouse and then

702
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,640
do some outdoor stuff um and kind of

703
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,558
have some food production along with it

704
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,159
so we can do a small CSA for our

705
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,599
patients and stuff like that like to

706
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:23,039
incorporate a lot more just just regular

707
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:26,839
agriculture as well um we're really

708
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:29,679
passionate about high quality uh food

709
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,119
and what we put into our systems I think

710
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,600
a lot of people who consume cannabis are

711
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,678
also very conscious of other things and

712
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,240
what they consume so to really kind of

713
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,600
tie more of the philosophy together um

714
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,480
is what I see us

715
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:48,678

716

with the with the Cannabis help all

747
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,759
right we got a bunch of quick fire

748
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,760
questions here from our uh our patreon

749
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:05,398
members let's dig into them really quick

750
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:09,200
fanda says do you make a Christmas

751
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:12,518
Advent calendar we don't that is a great

752
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,000
idea though a great idea it is a yeah

753
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,880
it's a fantastic idea we actually had a

754
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,720
few patients request one really so

755
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,278
that's been of that yet but I mean I

756
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,839
would get one for sure that would be a

757
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,119
rough month

758
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,839
man well you the edible you just you

759
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,918
know eat it before you go to bed well

760
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,720
after dinner all right Taco says what is

761
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,120
one of your favorite Edibles that you

762
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,120
use but don't

763
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:44,158
sell I don't think there is anyone that

764
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,359
we really I

765
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,679
mean there's nothing that I ever make

766
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,798
that's specifically for our line I would

767
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,360
say is kind of our lifestyle in a sense

768
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,240
we kind of what we'd like we make and we

769
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,199
won't sell anything that we wouldn't

770
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,000
personally want to buy or have so we've

771
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,759
kind of let me ask in this perspective

772
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,558
is there another company that makes

773
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,359
Edibles that you're like I would buy

774
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,599
theirs

775
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,759
honestly she won't need anybody else's

776
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,798
Edibles at this point

777
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,679
um

778
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:19,278
just uh steel says how do you feel about

779
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,000
edi's packaging that seems to resemble a

780
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,200
lot of the candy on the market for

781
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,079
example the nerd ropes and things like

782
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,639
that I mean teach their own do whatever

783
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,759
is on brand for for you for me that for

784
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:35,278
us that's not that's not our image

785
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,879
that's

786
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,558
not the the type of product that we're

787
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,760
trying to put out or

788
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:47,398
portray um I could never like put out a

789
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:50,278
Nerds Rope just it's just not our style

790
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:53,879
so but as I said to each their

791
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:57,079
own okay out of regular just like

792
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,559
everyday food is there something that we

793
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,558
can expect to never have from Tastefully

794
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:04,038
baked because you guys don't appreciate

795
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:06,480
it is there like a type of food that

796
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,039
each one of you just absolutely I will

797
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,878
not eat

798
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:13,440
that um for me it's walnuts I [ __ ] I

799
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,239
hate walnuts you don't like walnuts we

800
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
do stay away from nuts in our facility

801
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,519
that's the other big thing we do have a

802
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,959
few patients that I know that are you

803
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,398
know really sensitive to nuts and it's

804
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,878
something that I'm conscious of that a

805
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,358
lot of people don't eat certain things

806
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,199
because there's Edibles that are

807
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,799
produced in a facility that does with

808
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,960
nuts so I will say that if if I were to

809
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,039
draw a line somewhere on stuff it would

810
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,159
be

811
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,000
nuts are you just in Maine or are you in

812
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,358
other states of

813
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,320
Taco we are just in Maine just in Maine

814
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:47,119
right now yes do you guys have a

815
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,079
storefront where you can get edibles too

816
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,159
or is everything online so everything is

817
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,879
available we have so how it's set up

818
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,240
here is we have um we're the distributor

819
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,960
and we have various other storefront in

820
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,959
which we distribute our products too

then you have retail stores well we

823
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,920

um our rendition of a gummy which is you

831
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,160
know

832
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,079
kind of a I wouldn't say healthy version

833
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:36,000
but a a more conscious version of a of

834
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,920
candy can you all consider making some

835
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,079
AA fresa flavors for example a horchata

836
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,760
drink I agree with that one I agree with

837
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:47,680
that one Steele I'm all about the

838
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,280
horchata I will look into it uh Big Bad

839
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,480
John says best home

840
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,319
recipe what would be something that you

841
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,318
guys would recommend for medical

842
00:35:54,318 --> 00:36:00,719
patients we use uh we Infuse local honey

843
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:02,880
and then a lot of people like to make

844
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,078
tea with it um which is makes a really

845
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,200
good evening thing or there's a couple

846
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,880
recipes that I have up on our website

847
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,039
that mainly utilize honey and I think

848
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,358
honey is a great Universal ingredient

849
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,358
that people can apply to any dish really

850
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:18,119
and voila you have a cannabis infused

851
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:21,078
meal but there's a really good one up

852
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,480
there too for brussels sprouts with our

853
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,760
honey and a balsamic glazed drizzle with

854
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,760
some toasted pine nuts it's really good

855
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,240
it's really good

856
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,040
I know a lot of people don't like

857
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:36,118
brussels sprouts I'm a brussel freak I

858
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,880
love them but pan Fred nice

859
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,838
crispiness you can't go wrong I'm all

860
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,079
about that one so you guys can can go

861
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,559
over to Tastefully bake.com and check

862
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,318
out these infusions for yourself how are

863
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,960
you infusing the

864
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:53,880
honey the honey yeah everything that we

865
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,480
do is through a mechanical

866
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,440
homogenization oh okay so what it does

867
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,079
is it breaks everything down into really

868
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,639
small particles um so to make sure that

869
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,599
it's evenly homogeneous throughout the

870
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,239
entire product so you know it's

871
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,838
basically like a big metal cutting head

872
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,598
with another cutting head on the inside

873
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:13,639
that spins at like 40,000 RPMs and just

874
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,240
basically smashes everything apart at a

875
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:19,960
molecular level yeah to really

876
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:22,759
solubilize it yeah correct wow yeah uh

877
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,318
Big Bad John says you guys need to do a

878
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,200
cookbook that is a great idea that's

879
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:30,880
been another thing that's been on

880
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,919
on the back burner for a bit um but yeah

881
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,119
I think there's a you know it's fun to

882
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,079
be able to kind of take your dosage or

883
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,480
whatever into your own hands and kind of

884
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,039
make your own things at home that you

885
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,880
can serve for guests we definitely have

886
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,079
a some patients that do that as well so

887
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,519
they'll come back and then they'll tell

888
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,720

00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:05,400
can't tell very light body floating

894
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:07,159
feeling not too intense definitely worth

895
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,119
it absolutely but I think I'm not going

896
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,960
to eat the other half of that yet

897
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,599

little bit more uh he always wants to

901
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,560

918
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,960
until the government says they are and

919
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,199
then I think there's other aliens out

920
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,400
there that the government's trying to

921
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,078

over the walls there are a bunch of

929
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:26,119
newspaper clippings of stories of like

930
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,919
UFO activity in that area over the past

931
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:29,240
I don't know how many hundreds of years

932
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,838
type of

933
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:34,679
thing okay guys you guys have like five

934
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:37,480
more minutes uh if you have any more

935
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:40,078
questions get them in there really quick

936
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,159
um so if I stuck you guys out on a

937
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,680
desert

938
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,759
island I said you can only take one you

939
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:49,358
can take a lifetime supply but you can

940
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,960
only take one of your Edibles with you

941
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,000
for the rest of your

942
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,400
life you gonna

943
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
take I'd probably take the selers

944
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,760
personally

945
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,119
you take the saler I think so

946
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,119
Island yeah

947
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,160
well if you yeah it's an island Vibe

948
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,240
plus you get to have something to

949
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,279
drink I mean that's the most important

950
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,000
part the first she

951
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,200
show yeah that's fair enough that's fair

952
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,960
enough but they are 50 milligrams a

953
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:23,679
piece they are I'm sure after a while

954
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,358
after a year on the island you're just

955
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,639
going to be numb to

956
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,799
it be all right I'm hydrated and I'm

957
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,078
used to

958
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,680
it I'd hate to be the guy that had to

959
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,160
pick you up from that after a couple

960
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,960
years all

961
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,799
right we have seen some [ __ ] together it

962
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,318
sounds like I definitely know your story

963
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,079
Cad and I've heard theirs now that's

964
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:46,838
pretty cool that you guys have a working

965
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,640
relationship like that for as long as

966
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:52,639

967
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:55,838
you have for sure um I I know that's no

968
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,000

969
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,719
most people I can't imagine what you

970
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,119
guys had to go through but I got to say

971
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,639
