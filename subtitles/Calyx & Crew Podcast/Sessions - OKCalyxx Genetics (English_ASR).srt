minute now today we are going to be

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,920
talking about hash making we're going to

60
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,199
be talking about the pele player

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,199
ice cold h2o trichome isolation book as

62
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,199
well as some of your genetics which i'm

63
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,519
really stoked to hear what you're doing

64
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,238
so this hash you know a lot of people

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
know

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,920
you for

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,399
your composting and i've seen you do a

68
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,878
lot of content when it comes to

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,959
composting i feel like that's people

70
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,039
wanting me to talk about knf and i don't

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,039
always want to talk about knf

72
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,439
and i know that you have another love

73
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,400
and that's hash correct

74
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,560
you make some fire hash we absolutely

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,159
loved it and we're going to kind of get

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,479
back into those genetics later on in

77
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,799
this episode but first i want to hear

78
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,199
about what you took away from this book

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
you're a guy that i look forward to

80
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,679
hearing from when i need tips and advice

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,039
on hash making what did you get from

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,959
this that helped you out well

83
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,799
the book was very good no doubt about it

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,199
it's a collaborative piece

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
a lot of different hashmakers that a lot

86
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,878
of you guys know

87
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,719
and everybody contributed a

88
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,439
small piece they gave a lot of

89
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,919
information from their experience and

90
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,479
from the art that they perform you know

91
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,280
so it's really good lots of gold legacy

92
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,039
takeaway one thing good doc you and i

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,878
have the same washer

94
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,120
we have the same washer i don't have a

95
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,439
washer uh or the same we have the same

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,920
press sorry that's right the same press

97
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,680
yeah we do have the same press yes and i

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,719
love that i love that thing

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
that's a good press i got a washer and

100
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,840
after i read this book i'm like can't

101
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,399
i'm wish i didn't buy the washer but

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
it's the bottom agitating washers

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
the typical kind that you see everybody

104
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,798
using you know home growers using these

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,039
little washing machines but the

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
agitation on the bottom you know is

107
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,158
talked about so negatively throughout

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,599
this book and i was like oh gosh so now

109
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,239
i'm going to be like i got to find some

110
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,759
hand washing equipment but the reason

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
i'm saying that is because he gave a

112
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,039
nice little somebody i can't remember

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
who but one of the writers gave a nice

114
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,000
little nugget saying hand wash put all

115
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,639
your bud in your trim bag and give it a

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
hand wash you know do that for two three

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,040
minutes whatever and then put the

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,439
wash bud into the washer and that is

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
just a good kind of give and take and i

120
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,959
was kind of like yeah that's great

121
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,199
because really i don't hand wash i just

122
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,879
use my washing machine that i have and i

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
really try to filter it and clean it and

124
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,399
all that stuff as i'm going but i think

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,319
i'm gonna start trying to hand wash a

126
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,679
little bit probably the first round just

127
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,519
hand wash real good and then we'll use

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
my washer after that that's a good

129
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,599
nugget see and i'm on the opposite end

130
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,599
of the spectrum i've always hand washed

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,759
and i've never used one the machines i

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,879
was looking forward to it because i

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
thought it would cut out some of the

134
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,199
manual labor and now you're you gave me

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,680
some information earlier i'm like god

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,680
damn it

137
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,758
no

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,759
back to the hard work yep but the hard

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
work usually pays off the best right

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,080
exactly throughout the book they're

141
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,240
always saying hand washing is the best

142
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,079
so the biggest problem with this motor

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,280
on the bottom of the machine

144
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,918
what is it

145
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,239
so the problem with the bottom agitation

146
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,439
is that you know the trichomes will sink

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,038
to the bottom

148
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,719
and with hand washing you have you

149
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,959
little false bottom down there where all

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,000
your trichome can settle and you're not

151
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,758
stirring it a lot you know as your hand

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,279
as you're washing it it should be able

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,439
to settle more in those bigger buckets

154
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,879
with the bottom agitation all you're

155
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,279
doing is cycling

156
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,800
the bits and pieces back

157
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,038
you know into the water along with the

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
trichome and they're just getting bashed

159
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,918
down there you know just getting

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
hammered hammered hammer as you're

161
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,038
spinning it and it just leads to a

162
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,600
you know at least a little lesser

163
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,680
quality product now as a home grower

164
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
i'm not going to fuss and complain about

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
the raw that i've made you know i liked

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,759
it

167
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,038
but there you know we can clean it up a

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,840
little bit

169
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,680
by

170
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,758
not using that bottom agitation on my

171
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,519
first wash really trying to get a good

172
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,600
load of trichome heads off by hand

173
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,758
washing and then move to the washer but

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
that bottom agitation just constantly is

175
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
bashing those trichomes because they

176
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
think to the bottom that's the problem

177
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,120
so

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
this washer is forcing all those

179
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,478
trichomes

180
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,799
that motions kind of forcing it back up

181
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,120
into the material and not only that it's

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,280
kind of it's beating it around

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,439
that's right so that the bottom you know

184
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,439
if you fit some washing machines like

185
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,879
clothing washing machines

186
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,439
you if you look at the bottom you know

187
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,199
it turns back and forth back and forth

188
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,079
and that's what my washing machine does

189
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,560
also it just it spins one way and then

190
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,758
stops goes the other way and then stops

191
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,560
but yes as it's spinning it is well let

192
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,240
me back up if you're not using a trim

193
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,478
bag and you just throw all your flour

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,360
into the washing machine which is what i

195
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,959
do

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
it's really not good

197
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,680
especially just because you're getting

198
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,000
all kinds of bits and pieces and

199
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,079
particles and all that good stuff even

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
though the bud does float in the water

201
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,318
you're still getting little pieces

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
stirred up with that bottom agitation

203
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,560
and those little bits and pieces are

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,800
hitting those trichomes and either

205
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,639
sticking them together or sticking to

206
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,199
the trichome itself and then you have

207
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
contamination so if someone can invent

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,439
one of those washing machines with the

209
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
turnip with the agitation on the top

210
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,719
you might make some money

211
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,439
there's a million dollar idea right

212
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,440
there and you just gave it to them

213
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,839
that's right because he even says in the

214
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,759
book there's nothing on the market yeah

215
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,239
so okay that's where you start branding

216
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
this stuff come on you're handy

217
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,918
i hear you

218
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,598
i got too many kids

219
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:48,079
yeah no i hear you all right so we've

220
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,000
got this washer problem

221
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,038
you're saying manual is a way better way

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,079
to do it

223
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,399
let's get into the bags i've seen people

224
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,598
not using a work bag at all

225
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,598
and i believe you'd say use the work bag

226
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,680
right and not only that

227
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,159
you also have your collection bags and

228
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,319
i've seen quite a few people remove

229
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,319
certain bags that they didn't want is

230
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,280
there any benefits to this what do you

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
do

232
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,079
what i have done before and like i said

233
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,119
after i read this book and i went to a

234
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,359
918 og hash class a couple months ago

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,079
and i mean it was just great information

236
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,120
so i haven't watched since these classes

237
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,038
that class and this book so when i say i

238
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,598
used to do it this way it's because i

239
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,718
plan on doing it a new way but i did not

240
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,639
use a

241
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,120
trim bag or anything i just put the bud

242
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,199
in the water you know let it rehydrate

243
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
and then wash it that way i didn't use

244
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
the trim bag and the reason i didn't use

245
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,559
a trim bag is because i did

246
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,079
first couple washes i used a trim bag

247
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,159
you know before you put it's that big

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
kind of thing it's a 220. you put all

249
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,399
your butt in it and then you stick that

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,160
whole bag into the washer and it just

251
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,440
washes in the bag and so all your weed

252
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:00,319
is kept in that bag right however

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,000
it gets clogged quickly it gets clogged

254
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
with just the resin and the trichome

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,360
hitting that thing and when i did a wash

256
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,519
without it i had a much bigger return

257
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,440
and i mean so much greater return that

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,360
i'm like i'm never using that bag again

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
and i hadn't since

260
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
but

261
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,200
hand washing with that bag to get a real

262
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,519
superior product that's that's how you

263
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,040
have to do it and then you would then i

264
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,480
would take everything out of that bag

265
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,439
and put in my washer and do it the way i

266
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
used to

267
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,279
but usually if you want higher quality

268
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
you need to use your trim bag

269
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,039
okay

270
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,039
so it's not so much that it's let it's

271
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,639
not letting good trichome heads through

272
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,159
but it's also taking out a lot of

273
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,759
contaminants

274
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,519
yeah it does definitely do that it

275
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,838
definitely holds a lot of contaminant

276
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,080
but it does but it clogs and it holds

277
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
trichome into so you know you got to

278
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
play with your equipment see what you

279
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,759
want yeah what you want to do and now

280
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,560
you asked about the collection bags

281
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,919
you know the micron bags

282
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,039
in the book

283
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:02,000
he suggests that you use

284
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,759
all eight a full eight bag sets

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,839
and that would be the 220 bag

286
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:13,439
and then the the 190 the 160 the 120 the

287
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,920
90 the 73 the 45 and the 25

288
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,480
and if you're gonna begin to wash

289
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,879
if you have the money you might not but

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,800
if you can get the whole eight bag set

291
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,519
you will start to learn

292
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,278
which micron bags catch the most and you

293
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,278
know which is your good quality which is

294
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,799
your low quality now

295
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,559
my advice

296
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,719
is if you don't have the money to buy

297
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,159
all eight bags because they're not cheap

298
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
you know and they do break and you need

299
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,838
to get new ones sometimes but

300
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
what you want to do

301
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
here's what i have

302
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,639
i have the

303
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,000
well i'll start with the lower the lower

304
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,639
number because that's the one you stick

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,399
in the container first that's like if

306
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,720
you think of a 5 gallon bucket i'm gonna

307
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,519
put one of my micron bags in first and

308
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,000
it's going to be that 25 micron

309
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,480
inside of my 25 micron i'm gonna stick

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
my 73 micron

311
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,959
and then i'm going to stick inside 73 my

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,200
120

313
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:12,159
and then my 160 and the 220 is the last

314
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,079
one the highest quality bags are going

315
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,838
to be your your 120 or 90 or 73

316
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,239
that's gonna be your best

317
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
your best catch of head

318
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,959
they're gonna fit right there and you're

319
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,278
gonna be able to wash some debris

320
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,958
through and all that good stuff so 120

321
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,039
90 and 73

322
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,239
you want those bags for sure you know if

323
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,360
you can't afford any other ones

324
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
definitely get those three because

325
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,000
that's what catches your good stuff

326
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,600
and then of course the 45 and the 25

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,679
become lower quality as you go down

328
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,000
it just starts to catch a lot of the

329
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,399
bits and pieces now i

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,879
i will melt that down and still use it

331
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,039
myself for medicine the 25 and the 45

332
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,958
it's still it's still gonna work this

333
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,599
just has more contamination in it and it

334
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,599
will it will be almost a green you know

335
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,079
greenish color sometimes that's your

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
contamination you do not want to use the

337
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,679
220 that's you're going to throw that

338
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,479
out throw that in your compost

339
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,559
and the 190 is rough also

340
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,399
what is typically in those bags is it

341
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,039
the stocks is it

342
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,200
leaf matter plant matter

343
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,039
okay so whenever you're washing

344
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,920
especially like

345
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,159
when i wash my bud in my washing machine

346
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,759
imagine if you will the washing machine

347
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,838
and i have all that bud in there and

348
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,399
it's been spinning and spinning and i'm

349
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,959
ready to drain it and so i'll drain it

350
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,200
down through all of those bags and what

351
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,879
you're catching is what has been washed

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
off the plant and if you got a bunch of

353
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,240
dirt you're going to get all the dirt

354
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
too you know it's been pesticide

355
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
anything like that you're getting it

356
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,200
but hopefully you don't have that and

357
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
you have a lot of resin a lot of

358
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,959
trichome heads and you know you'll have

359
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,079
some of the stock we're talking you know

360
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,679
microscopic here you gotta you know need

361
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,599
a jeweler's eye or something but the

362
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,799
stalk of a trichome head will be in

363
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,120
those bags

364
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,039
but what you want is that head

365
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,560
that little circle around pretty saying

366
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,240
that everybody looks at

367
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,119
you're trying to catch just those you

368
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
know

369
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,679
so you don't have a lot of plant

370
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
material you're not going to have leaves

371
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,000
or anything you're just going to have

372
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,159
little bits of broken leaves and you

373
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
know what's referred to as contamination

374
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,719
because you don't want leaves you just

375
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,360
want that hit

376
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,560
right one thing that i wanted to ask you

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,399
about is full spec what do you need to

378
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,319
match that description of full spec

379
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,799
which one of these bags are we taking

380
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
from and what needs to be included in

381
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,359
the final product

382
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,959
all right

383
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,480
i will let's see

384
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,719
let me read you from the book on page 17

385
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,039
under the title collection bags

386
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,000
another method of collection would be to

387
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,559
mix all of the various bags together to

388
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,639
make what is known as full spec if

389
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,838
electing to go the full spectre out it

390
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,278
would be wise to remove all their bags

391
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,079
and use only

392
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,519
your high quality bags your 120 at 90 or

393
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,638
73

394
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,240
maybe you're 45 and 25 but when you mix

395
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
all your bags

396
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
all of the uh you know the product that

397
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,040
you've collected in your bags a lot of

398
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
people want to keep the 73 by itself

399
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,159
because they feel that's the best

400
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,959
quality and they won't mix it with the

401
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,639
90 or the 120 micron bags they keep it

402
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,319
all separate but what the book is saying

403
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,759
if you want to do a full spec you're

404
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,680
going to mix your 120 your 90 to 73 45

405
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,679
25 you can mix it all together if you

406
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,919
want or you can just choose three bags

407
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,439
to mix together and you get this what's

408
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,559
called the full spec

409
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
okay so either way nice i was hoping it

410
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,239
wasn't going to include that

411
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,838
contamination bag that you were talking

412
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,120
about with all the leaf matter and

413
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,000
everything the 220 no no no no yeah yeah

414
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,679
let's make sure that everybody

415
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,958
understands that but not not those

416
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,759
contaminations the like the 220 the 190

417
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:50,000
the 160 those are gonna be rough maybe

418
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,879
160 might keep it i've kept it many

419
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,799
times have you ever smoked it yes

420
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,399
yes

421
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,359
there's people going to you but they've

422
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,159
done it too they've done it too

423
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,399
hey man i'm a home medicator dude you

424
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,639
got to try your stuff you got to try it

425
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,879
yeah i've thrown away lots of rosin guys

426
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,600
lots of rosin it's just like i'm not

427
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,679
smoking that i messed that up man really

428
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,399
oh yeah i haven't made enough to say

429
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,958
that

430
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,360
actually i just messed up a batch of one

431
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,278
of my genetics my tklb

432
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,360
i'm just learning how to jar check it

433
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,039
because i learned it at 918 og's class

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,320
he taught us how to you know use heat

435
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,159
and all this stuff because i've never

436
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,959
done i've only cold cured

437
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,879
but my first jar tick i definitely

438
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,000
cooked it way too long and it was so

439
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,078
dark

440
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
it was fun though i messed it up i have

441
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,000
done that i have done that and i had i

442
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,000
have had success recently

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,639
but the big the biggest thing is

444
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,440
patience and i definitely screwed up my

445
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,959
first one it turned into this d carved

446
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,440
black almost clear crap

447
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,439
yeah it's good and dark that's how we

448
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,920
learn though that's correct you get to

449
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,320
mess up man we need to mess up so we've

450
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,078
learned about this manual washing

451
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,639
versus the

452
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,198
machine washing and which one's better

453
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,799
we talked about collection bags and the

454
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,639
use of the work bag

455
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,958
what's the next step after this you've

456
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,879
grabbed all your hash and everything

457
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,119
how are you going to dry it out

458
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,799
this is the tough one this is the step

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
that if you're a home grower and you

460
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,639
want to get into getting your own hash

461
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,919
making and really trying to get quality

462
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,440
you're going to have to figure out ways

463
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,479
to try this stuff

464
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
and

465
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
it's nice

466
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
when you know guys grows like i do who

467
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
have freezers and all that stuff and i

468
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,838
can take it up there when i want it

469
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,519
frozen i don't always want it froze

470
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,279
freeze-dried sometimes i just like it

471
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,198
room dried i think that sometimes it has

472
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,439
a better taste sometimes when it's

473
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,838
freeze-dried it's hard to work with it a

474
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,360
little bit it's for me it is and i

475
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,480
i need more experience of course but for

476
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,039
me it's still hard to work with when

477
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,278
it's frozen when it's when it's been

478
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,439
dried like on cardboard in front of a

479
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,958
fan in my shed

480
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,279
it tastes good

481
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,758
here's how i do it whenever i've washed

482
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,558
and i i'm scraping all of that gooey

483
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,038
goodness out of those micron bags

484
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,480
what i do as a home grower and don't

485
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,879
everybody freak out but this is how it

486
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,759
has to be done sometimes i will get

487
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,280
parchment paper and i'll i'll spread it

488
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,640
out as thin as i possibly can on

489
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,038
parchment paper

490
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,520
and even you might you you can even add

491
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,879
a little bit of water and to even get it

492
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,000
thinner and you know thinking that's

493
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,360
counterproductive because you're trying

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,759
to get it dried out but actually if you

495
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,599
can get the chunk thinner you know if

496
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,839
you're going to have blobby chunks and

497
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,240
you need to get it nice and flat and the

498
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,000
thinner you can get it you can spread it

499
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
out over more surface area you can get

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
it to dry out faster so a little water

501
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,000
actually helps get it spread out you put

502
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,759
it like a parchment sheet or parchment

503
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,319
paper inside a cookie sheet is a good

504
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,160
way to do it put all your put your hash

505
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,918
or put all of your bubble hats that

506
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,000
you've got add a little water make sure

507
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,720
it gets nice and thin and then put a fan

508
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,798
on it dries out fast we're talking about

509
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,079
it how long are we talking about on a

510
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:04,160
dry time it's not like flour the slower

511
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,240
you go the better it's going to be

512
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,759
it just needs to dry out

513
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,038
from my experience when somebody else

514
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,519
smarter me might tell you something

515
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,839
different but i just need to get it dry

516
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,599
you definitely don't want water at all

517
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,079
you're going to run it you start to

518
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,480
learn that you had water in your hash

519
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,839
and it's like oh dang it you know little

520
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,160
burny nasty tasting but anyway put it on

521
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,558
that parchment paper inside a cookie

522
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
cooking sheet add a little water thin it

523
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,240
out real well spread it all over get a

524
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,558
lot of surface area covered add a fan on

525
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,880
it and you know and it needs to not be

526
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,839
in a hot hot shed it needs to be if you

527
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,280
can keep it you know 60 70 that'd be

528
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:46,079
nice let it dry out and then again

529
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,839
my storage has changed big time

530
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,639
are you storing it in about the same

531
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,720
conditions i never store it once it's

532
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
dried i immediately pressed it just

533
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,279
because i didn't have ability to really

534
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,240
store it real well but after reading

535
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,678
this book actually ah frozen storage

536
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
page 30

537
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,120
in the fabulous book called ice cold h2o

538
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
trichome isolations by pele pellet page

539
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,759
30.

540
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,080
here's some tips guys i'm telling you

541
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,079
this this is just this stuff terpenes

542
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,639
are easily la i'm reading from the book

543
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,240
here terpenes are easily lost through

544
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
temperature fluctuation

545
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,839
the key is to always keep the bubble

546
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,359
hash which is what we scraping out of

547
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,959
the bags everybody so we're talking

548
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,719
about bubble ash

549
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,240
always keep the bubble hash in the

550
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,640
freezer in a parchment lined mason jar

551
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,679
never compress your bubble hash

552
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,840
at all treat the hash very gently

553
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,160
don't pack your hash down in that jar i

554
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,439
used to do that i used to not as much as

555
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,600
i could but i mean i packed it in

556
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,000
because i didn't have enough jars maybe

557
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,879
but now it's like oh yeah keep this

558
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,679
stuff fluffy keep it put that parchment

559
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,960
paper inside that mason jar you know get

560
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,200
that top on it

561
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,519
keep it cold take care of it like it's a

562
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
dang newborn baby because you're keeping

563
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,119
all those terps in there and of course

564
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,960
that's the ultimate thing when we're

565
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,239
dealing with hash when we're dealing

566
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
with rosin

567
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,000
we're wanting we know the high's gonna

568
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,640
be there it's it's gonna be there you

569
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,038
know but we want that flavor pop we

570
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,320
wanted to just be like

571
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,558
you know smack your lips trying to run

572
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,480
it through your nose again taste it yeah

573
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,519
so we want to keep this stuff nice and

574
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,960
cold

575
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,918
keep it you know low temps so go ahead

576
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
okay

577
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,559
what size portions would you put in what

578
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,919
size jar

579
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:35,359
i use what is it like half court mason

580
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,400
jars with the small ones maybe no half

581
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,359
pint jar i think it's what it is okay

582
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,919
but

583
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,918
really you don't want a lot of air so i

584
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,720
would go ahead and just kind of fill it

585
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,919
up to the top close it up you know you

586
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,440
don't want just a whole lot of air in

587
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,440
there the problem is you don't always

588
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,519
have a lot of a lot of hash

589
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,360
if you can only fill your jar halfway up

590
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,038
cover it with parchment paper before you

591
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,038
feel it you know cover it put parchment

592
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,798
paper down on the top of it a little bit

593
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,640
and then seal your jar i mean that's the

594
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,759
best you can do do you understand what

595
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,759
i'm saying

596
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,558
yeah no i'm taking in a lot of this man

597
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,119
because like i said i lately i've been

598
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,879
growing some more hash oriented

599
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,038
cultivars so

600
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,679
even though i'm a heavy flower guy i

601
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,839
love bubble hash i just hated do the

602
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,480
doing the manual mixing of all of it you

603
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,558
know i saw us really looking i was

604
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,798
looking forward to that machine

605
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,038
but if the quality is the best on the

606
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,879
manual i'll go back to it

607
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,200
it's a lot of work i'm not throwing my

608
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,440
machine away so you heard me say that

609
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,679
i'm still keeping it right

610
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,600
it's still beneficial especially for

611
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,519
people like me that don't want to bend

612
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,959
their back over stern you know for what

613
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,440
three minutes

614
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
in segments

615
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,919
so let's go over

616
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,440
some terms that you were talking about

617
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,440
earlier when we were talking about you

618
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,200
coming on the podcast and talking about

619
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
hash there's a few things that you said

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,720
that i kind of wanted you to elaborate

621
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,840
on what is this

622
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,319
greasing versus pre-greasing

623
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:07,038
oh yeah this is new to me so let me

624
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,879
start off with that but it's just oh

625
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,679
this is new to you okay

626
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,320
yeah the the words the labeling of the

627
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,320
action you know what i'm saying like i

628
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,000
kind of did it but i didn't know ah

629
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,759
we're gonna grease or pre-grease you

630
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,480
know stuff like that so it's fun to know

631
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,480
those words for me i like it because it

632
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,360
just it cleans it up you know cleans

633
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,599
conversation up quickly let me see

634
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:34,479
page 27 right so it's where the terms

635
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,158
pre-greasing and greasing

636
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,558
and stamping is also there but

637
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,679
pre-greasing and that's

638
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,440
g-r-e-a-s-i-n-g like greece and it's

639
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,640
because you're going to get greasy you

640
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,400
know when you're when you're smashing

641
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,159
these heads yeah it's going to get

642
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,759
greasy you want some grease

643
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,960
pre-greasing

644
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,839
is when

645
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
let's see

646
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,279
let me see if i can actually read it as

647
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,360
mentioned let's see another technique is

648
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,319
to pre-grease the hash

649
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,240
and form hash pucks using a pre-press

650
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,079
mold so you guys know what i'm talking

651
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,960
about a lot of you have those

652
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,319
press molds circles or squares you put

653
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,558
your hash in there and you're just kind

654
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,839
of compacting it down trying to get it

655
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,519
even

656
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,519
you don't want holes

657
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,599
in your hash you know in that little

658
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,839
pocket you want it nice and solid you

659
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:23,359
want it nice and flat on the top and

660
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,599
bottom because you want surface area

661
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,678
you want it to be able to spread out

662
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,199
nice and evenly

663
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,320
you know what i'm saying

664
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,279
when you pre-grease your bubble hash you

665
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,879
are just putting it into a mold form not

666
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,960
in a bag and that's how i'm

667
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,320
understanding pre-greasing and i mean i

668
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,360
think a lot of people pre-grease and

669
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,158
then the other one called greasing

670
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,678
is

671
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,919
how i'm understanding it is when you

672
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,679
have when you put your bubble hash in

673
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
the bag itself

674
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,759
and then you give it that good nice

675
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,359
smashing and you try to even it out

676
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,119
throughout the bag get the corners

677
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,199
filled up and all that stuff that's

678
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,199
that's called grease in your bag

679
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,120
so those are two fun terms i had no idea

680
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,880
but those are terms i'm assuming good

681
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,558
hash makers use

682
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
because they talked about it they they

683
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,519
use that you know they use that in this

684
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,519
book

685
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,440
i'm not a good hashmaker i'm sitting

686
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,480
here going you do that you spread it

687
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
over the bottom of the bag

688
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,079
yes so the other i was like oh scoop it

689
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,918
up with the spoon

690
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,879
when you got your bubble hash in your in

691
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,240
your

692
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,840
bags and you're gonna put it in your

693
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,000
press and smash it

694
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,759
you don't want one part

695
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,679
thicker than the other part and you

696
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,440
don't want one corner skinnier than the

697
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,038
middle you know what i'm saying you want

698
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,640
it spread out you want a nice even press

699
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,400
there's a style called bottle tech style

700
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,120
and it's where you take your rosin bag

701
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,759
like when i press rosin or sorry when i

702
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,798
press bubble hash into rosin

703
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,119
i use two 25 micron bags i double bag it

704
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,038
right 25 microns are very very small

705
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:01,000
until it really you have five kids you

706
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,000
do not double bag it

707
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,919
uh your wife is over there shaking her

708
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,239
head

709
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,159
bill i know man she will be when she is

710
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,679
the podcast

711
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,600
exactly

712
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,278
oh man forget

713
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
if you don't double bag you blow out

714
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,919
everybody and that's how you get funky

715
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,159
you did that of course i did this my

716
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,159
show

717
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,120
oh god so i'm back to double bagging it

718
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,520
25 25 i'm glad i prompted you into that

719
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,199
loaded my first bag

720
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,519
okay so you're double bagging it but

721
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,360
you're double bagging it

722
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,960
real good when i've got it in there you

723
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,399
know well actually hold on we were

724
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
talking about bottle tag that's what we

725
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,080
were talking about i was going somewhere

726
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,759
else real quick so bottle pecking your

727
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,519
your rosin bag

728
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,759
here's the idea and you got to use your

729
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,240
imagination with me you're holding your

730
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,798
small little 25 feet micron bag and the

731
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,359
opening is towards the top right

732
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,440
the bottom corners

733
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,639
what you do is you would take a pin or a

734
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,558
dab tool and you invert the corner so

735
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,480
the corner isn't poking out but it's now

736
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,639
poking up and into the bag you know what

737
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,240
i'm saying and you do that on both

738
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,278
bottom corners

739
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,919
and

740
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,880
okay so the idea is that

741
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
that is

742
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,640
stopping

743
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,960
the little bitty corner

744
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,559
from not having anything in it okay i

745
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,798
knew that but why do you do that

746
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,240
it'll catch your rosin like if you just

747
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,000
left the bag un bottle tech if you will

748
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,000
you've got if you fill it up with rosin

749
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
or flour you're gonna have the core the

750
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,319
edges the corners not full and those

751
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,839
little things are like pockets to catch

752
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,960
all your rocks yeah

753
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,199
well you know what i'm saying it won't

754
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,278
catch all of it but it will catch it

755
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,360
yeah yeah so when you put the corner

756
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:54,000
when you invert the corner you have

757
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,918
bubble hash consuming that inverted

758
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,640
corner right they're pushing they're

759
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,960
pushing past then instead of filling it

760
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,799
up that makes a lot of sense

761
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,159
and there's no there's no hole there

762
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,038
that's the idea

763
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,760
it is uh stamping i think uh

764
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,960
let's see i'm gonna read from the

765
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:15,119
book again on page 27. gotcha that's

766
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,120
actually pretty damn smart so what's

767
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,119
this uh what's the stamping that you

768
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,798
were talking about what does the book

769
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,959
say the book says

770
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,679
pre-pressing your filter bags once

771
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,640
packed is not a bad idea either this is

772
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,480
stamping you fill your bags and then

773
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,320
like if you have a big square mold or a

774
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,558
long rectangle mold that fits your bag

775
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,720
or whatever whatever form you're using a

776
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,319
circle even you know pack your bags and

777
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,079
then put them back in the molds stamp it

778
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,079
real good get it all packed in and then

779
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,519
you're ready to put it in your

780
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,599
press

781
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,359
that's stamping your bag and i can tell

782
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,959
you right now kelly pillaire if you're

783
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,959
listening and i make any mistakes i

784
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,840
apologize please correctly but that's

785
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,679
that's how i'm gonna stand in the book

786
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,599
we betcha

787
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,519
we mess up

788
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,798
this is a show where we smoke a lot of

789
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,319
cannabis so

790
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,319
mistakes are bound to happen

791
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:12,079
so when you're doing the stamping

792
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,359
there's no heat on the plates at all

793
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,359
yeah that's correct you're not you're

794
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,199
not doing anything with your plate

795
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,000
you're only your heating plates you're

796
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,360
only messing with a cold probably

797
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,720
aluminum or steel little little piece

798
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,359
okay so

799
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,839
a pre-pressed mold like for flour would

800
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,199
be the same thing

801
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,119
gotcha that's it yeah you can do the

802
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,640
same thing exactly

803
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,278
okay so i have one more question for you

804
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,880
really quick before we go to break

805
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:41,679
fresh frozen

806
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,480
what

807
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,919
is the qualifying term for fresh frozen

808
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,839
we were talking about this in our

809
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
discord the other day the guys were

810
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,439
asking me is this mean that it's taken

811
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,319
down right away that it's frozen right

812
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,720
there

813
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,038
does fresh frozen or like a freeze dryer

814
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,200
does that count as fresh frozen my

815
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,440
answer at the time

816
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,000
was i had always heard even if you had

817
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,960
taken the plant down let it do a slow

818
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,440
dry

819
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,679
before curing and using it that still

820
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,480
qualifies as fresh frozen

821
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,320
okay this was addressed at 918 og's

822
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,399
homemakers hash class

823
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,158
so yeah fresh frozen is when is when you

824
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,079
cut the plant well you cut all your

825
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,480
families off or anything that does isn't

826
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,439
consumed with trichome you know

827
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,679
and

828
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,679
okay so see that this my brain locking

829
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,759
up just shows you i learned so dang much

830
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,480
i don't know where to go sometimes now

831
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,919
but

832
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
918

833
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,880
he said

834
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,278
he likes to

835
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,039
what's called what in the book i think

836
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,038
is kind of called well

837
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,398
let's see well no it's not

838
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:43,839
he likes to

839
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,359
sometimes depending on the strain of

840
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,519
course it's all strain dependent but

841
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,398
sometimes he will like he'd like the

842
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,599
sunstrength to dry for maybe a two or

843
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,158
three days

844
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,918
then he puts it into the freezer and

845
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,120
treats it's the same

846
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,120
and he says

847
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,038
often you get better taste you know you

848
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,599
get more return for sure he says you

849
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,720
always get more return almost always

850
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,199
he said

851
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,880
you'll get a bigger return whenever you

852
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,360
cut the plant let it dry for two to

853
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,600
three days then stick it in the freezer

854
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,359
and then treat it like fresh frozen you

855
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,319
get a better return with the fresh

856
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,558
frozen

857
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,599
why is that is it styles and

858
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,759
cannabinoids like evaporating on

859
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,639
but you're getting i think you're

860
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,240
getting

861
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,320
here's what i'm learning a little bit

862
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,599
and based on page seven which deals with

863
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,000
all these trichome heads and the

864
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,398
epidermal cells and the hypodermal cells

865
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,558
you know of those trichome stocks

866
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:37,839
it actually there's more water getting

867
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,240
out of the plant

868
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,199
and so that stalk gets a little more

869
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,278
brittle

870
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,919
and so it breaks off easier and you get

871
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,000
a you get a bigger release on your first

872
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,960
wash right and you just get a good

873
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,880
amount off of it so a little bit of

874
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,038
drying kind of dehydrates it and helps

875
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,640
to make things brittle but if you do it

876
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,398
too much it makes your leaves brittle

877
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,120
too right and so you can't do it too

878
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,079
much can't dry out too much

879
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,839
gotcha

880
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,079
i find that really interesting that you

881
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,480
didn't like the taste of the fresh

882
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,439
frozen hash next to

883
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,919
your you know home dried because i feel

884
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,640
the same way about flour exactly i'd

885
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,120
rather have a slow-dried flour next to

886
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,360
yeah this isn't any kind of braggart

887
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,599
thing and our processors in oklahoma are

888
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,000
fantastic guys i can promise you that

889
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,398
the wreck market here is really known

890
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,319
for fresh frozen it's take it down get

891
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,558
it you know in packages and get it on

892
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,918
the market as soon as possible i just

893
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,839
don't i see a big degradation in flavor

894
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,919
and quality overall

895
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,199
the way i like to do it i like to press

896
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,399
my flour

897
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,200
i love pressed flour rosin because to me

898
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,158
it has the most flavor and it has a more

899
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,080
a more body high a more of a head high

900
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,039
body height you know just a thicker high

901
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,960
maybe is a good word for it i like flour

902
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,798
pressed and i like that flour rising but

903
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,798
of course i love bubble hash rosin

904
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,240
because it does have good taste but the

905
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,319
high is just

906
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,240
really good you know really quick good

907
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,079
high you can tell you're like oh that's

908
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,558
good stuff but i love the taste of

909
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,240
flowers that's just me that's me

910
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,879
the anything you know the things that

911
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,640
you tasted for me were all flowers

912
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,240
just pressed flowers you know wasn't

913
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,240
bubble uh well i think some levels

914
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,640
bubble hash but a lot of my stuff is

915
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,000
just flourishing that's what i do

916
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,720
it's tasty

917
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,480
i agree with it i mean i haven't had too

918
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,558
much whenever we have bubble hash we

919
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,399
typically smoke it and that's why i want

920
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,960
to get a washer or something like that

921
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,719
so i can try pressing the bubble ash so

922
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,319
most of what i've done so far has just

923
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
been flower pressing but i'm really

924
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,480
really enjoying it and i agree with you

925
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,440
the flavor is there

926
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,038
good

927
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
and every single one of those was

928
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,440
delicious too by the way

929
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,600
you took some of those genetics from

930
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,200
those concentrates that you gave us and

931
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,759
you actually started

932
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,679
working them into your own lines correct

933
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,440
that is correct that blueberry muffin

934
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,919
from hunt the humble sea company that i

935
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,558
sent to you that that was the best flat

936
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,840
rosin i ever had in my life and

937
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,440
it was just a

938
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,199
no just to press the flower i mean the

939
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,440
flower smells so good anyway anybody

940
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,319
who's grown that blueberry muffin

941
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,278
knows what we're saying it smells so

942
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,079
good and the taste is lingers in your

943
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,558
nose oh it was the best so yes i took

944
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,798
that blueberry muffin that was intense

945
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,038
that was good stuff and

946
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,839
the one plant that i'm really going to

947
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,599
focus on because you can't do all i do

948
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,720
all those crosses and i give away lots

949
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,199
of seeds

950
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,240
so you can't really breed

951
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,919
a bunch of strings it's so much work and

952
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,720
me being a home grower i can't have a

953
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,960
whole bunch of plants going so my focus

954
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,079
is what's called the blueberry squealer

955
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
and that is

956
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,798
the blueberry muffin

957
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:53,678
and it has been crossed with blueberry

958
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,639
train mac from black label organic and

959
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,960
that is

960
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,880
brandon russ he's a just a fantastic

961
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,038
grower full of knowledge

962
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,840
and a super super duper helpful yeah

963
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,278
great genetics just fantastic i'm sure a

964
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,879
lot of you guys know

965
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,119
so i crossed those two together and i

966
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,440
got blueberry squealer i have

967
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,599
nine i think it's nine blueberry

968
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,760
squealers going right now and we're

969
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,639
trying to get those going and again

970
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,800
great genetics you know afino hunt is

971
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,559
like the great those awesome guys who

972
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,280
got the big buildings you know we're

973
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,119
gonna do awesome 100 plants we're going

974
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,879
to pheno hunt you know i'm female

975

hunting eight or nine and that's how i

976
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,639
can do it and that's how a lot of home

977
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,720
growers can do it too if you just get

978
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,878
started but i've got my blueberry

979
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,118
squealers and i'm gonna try to

980
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,639
see the pretty ladies and find that one

981
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,559
good male if i get one they haven't been

982
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,559
sexted yet i don't know what they are

983
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,559
but i want to get them to f2s get them

984
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,398
into f3s start back crossing and all

985
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,398
that good stuff because

986
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,559

so i don't have to remember it you know

1049
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,960
what i'm saying that my the the lineage

1050
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,320
of lady breast that's why

1051
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,480
the lineage of the tk plants

1052
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,680
pulled those two things up

1053
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,358
so

1054
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,118
i crossed the blueberry muffin we were

1055
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,519
talking about the blueberry muffin from

1056
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,358
the humboldt seed company and blueberry

1057
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,960
train mac from black label organics here

1058
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,358
in oklahoma

1059
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,800

1060
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,400
squeezers going

1061
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,000
i don't know the sex

1062
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
yet but i got i think i think it was

1063
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
eight

1064
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,759
or i have going they're all about two

1065
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,599
three inches tall

1066
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,079
but we're doing a little hunt with those

1067
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,599
and trying to get them f2s and really

1068
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,519
see what we can get going we're in the

1069
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,280
early stages of it but that's where we

1070
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,679
are i've sent out

1071
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
a lot of seeds so you're referring to

1072
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,559
all the a couple of plants that i've

1073
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,200
done i

1074
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,279
when i cross like when i find a

1075
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,799
male and i'm like okay this smells

1076
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,320
awesome i'm gonna cross it with

1077
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,680
everything i can you know everything i'm

1078
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,680
growing you know i'm just going to cross

1079
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,199
with every strain i'm growing

1080
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,039
that's my approach

1081
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,118
because that's how i like to do it

1082
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,279
i don't always do that but whenever i'm

1083
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,119
whenever i find like i found a killer

1084
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,320
queen smell

1085
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,960
that was so

1086
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,720
pretty and so big and it was just

1087
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,079
aggressive like

1088
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,439
i had a few people coming out to my

1089
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,800
house and actually just looking at it

1090
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,320
like this is the best smell i've ever

1091
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,800
grown so anyway

1092
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,519
that killer queen male was a plant it

1093
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,079
was a male that i used to pollinate a

1094
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,759
herd of strains and that it's been a

1095
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,079
couple years back

1096
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,640
but i've sent a lot of those out

1097
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,560
and on my genetics page okay collection

1098
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,118
at okay calyx genetics

1099
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,519
at ok calyx genetics you will see

1100
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,800
pictures of some of those older crosses

1101
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,239
that are kind of starting to come back

1102
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,039
now you know it's kind of that's what's

1103
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,358
cool i sent out things a year ago

1104
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,199
and now you start to see some pictures

1105
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,039
of the results and it's fun and that's

1106
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,879
one of the problems breeding you have to

1107
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,559
wait so long yeah it takes a lot of time

1108
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,559
but that killer queen was a beautiful

1109
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,279
male and i just crossed a lot of things

1110
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,599
up and i sent out a lot of things a lot

1111
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,320
of strains to people and it's been fun

1112
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,960
it's been rewarding also because i've

1113
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,960
got to know so many people on instagram

1114
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,199
and i'm talking oklahoma folks

1115
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,199
where we i've met them we've i've gone

1116
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,279
to their house or we've met someplace

1117
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,118
and we smoked just just to talk and meet

1118
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,560
each other because we have so much you

1119
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
know this one thing in common we love

1120
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,440
cannabis

1121
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,480
and we can just talk and talk and talk

1122
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,920
but

1123
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,400
it's been fun for me to send my send all

1124
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,920
these strains out and and see some fun

1125
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,320
things come back yeah you're doing those

1126
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,079

1127
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,400

1130
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,078
growers i have to most of my buddies

1131
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,400
that are in washington are over on the

1132

west coast so it's like [ __ ] am i gonna

1133
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,800
make a three-hour run and then drive

1134
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,960

1137
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,039
doing that

1138
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,800
it's very good

1139
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,960
whenever you pollinate things and like

1140
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,560
when i pollinate i pollinate i pollinate

1141
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
every plant i've got

1142
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,159
but you you're going to end up with

1143
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,719
thousands of seeds that you will never

1144
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,399
use you know what i'm saying why why not

1145

1147
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,440
a unicorn that they think is just

1148
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,559

1149
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,800
that's what's so cool about our

1150
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,039
community also kind of off public

1151
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
we can make our own medicine and send it

1152
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,800
through seed to people and they can grow

1153
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,480

1154
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,400

1195
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,480

1197
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,280
the lineage and that's the name and then

1198
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,318
you cross that with the lady breath

1199
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,240
so i crossed that yeah that was a female

1200
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,519
that's from black label that keep tks

1201
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,519
from black label organics here in

1202
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,519
oklahoma i took

1203
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,079
and then i took a lady breath

1204
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,239
and i got this lady breath from a friend

1205
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,079
at el danke reno here in town that i've

1206
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,318
met through instagram

1207
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,599
he had this lady breast it's kind of a

1208
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,719
smaller plant

1209
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,920
but it's the male the pollen sacks were

1210
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:48,799
purple and red and it was just real

1211
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,519
enticing to the eye to me

1212
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,640
it wasn't a big plant at all but it was

1213
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,039
so pretty the male i hadn't seen a male

1214
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,480
like have a lot of color you know have

1215
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,079
you seen males with lots of colors

1216
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,480
because you deal with plants way more

1217
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,000
than me i think doc i yeah i've found

1218
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,000
quite a a few colorful males but to be

1219
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,719
attractive to the eye like that it's

1220
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,159
it's not very often no

1221
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:17,118
i think uh i had one in the sinai

1222
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,960
recently that was very very black

1223
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,800
by late bloom

1224
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,400
and then the other one was the blueberry

1225
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
grapefruit by

1226
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,720
relic seeds and that was the goose babe

1227
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,399
blueberry crossed into the grapefruit

1228
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,838
inbred line i believe

1229
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,920
don't quote me on that but i'm pretty

1230
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:34,719
sure that was that was close to what it

1231
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,480
was

1232
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,039
but that thing was awesome in the mail

1233
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,960
on that one throughout like these deep

1234
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,400
purple stems and then the actual petals

1235
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,599
of the flower

1236
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,720

1322
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,400
how i messed up here's something i

1323
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,920
learned and became better after that

1324
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,318
plant and this is what people this is

1325
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,960
why we talk make other people better

1326
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,880
what i did was i took i took about a 25

1327
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,000
gallon pot and

1328
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,559
i got two blueberry muffin females

1329
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,838
going in that pot and then

1330
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,078
i found the

1331
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,960
blueberry train mack mill that i wanted

1332
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,359
and i put it in that same pot

1333
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,720
and they weren't all real big but it was

1334
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,239
just something i was doing it's

1335
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,358
something i was messing with and just

1336
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,159
having fun

1337
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,679
and so they all got about

1338
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,118
i don't know

1339
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,919
two feet tall in this big pot

1340
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,400
but

1341
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,318
what i learned was this i rushed it i

1342
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,880
didn't let the i didn't let those plants

1343
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,000
veg i didn't let my females veg long

1344
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,880
enough

1345
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,400
i let them go i let them get kind of big

1346
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,920
and i was like man i want to flower them

1347
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,838
because i want to get these seeds going

1348
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,280
you know and all this and so i

1349
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,039
intentionally rushed it but i didn't

1350
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,440
realize that there's a detriment to it

1351
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:00,000
by not letting your females veg out and

1352
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,599
kind of mature a little bit you know in

1353
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,119
veg even and then let them flower for a

1354
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,400
week or two before you hit them with the

1355
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,640
pollen you know

1356
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,160
mine didn't veg real long and they got

1357
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,920
hit with pollen on day one they put out

1358
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:15,279
a pistol because that male already had

1359
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,800
pollen just flying from it right and so

1360
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,519
that small kind of or that i guess

1361
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,318
maybe not totally mature veg plant and

1362
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,079
then real early pollination

1363
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:29,358
reading the books that i've been reading

1364
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,119
now those are two things that that i i

1365
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,119
saw in books that they'll say yeah this

1366
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,720
might cause you a problem you got to let

1367
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,800
these plants mature a little bit more in

1368
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,919
veg and in flower before you know

1369
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,119
anything happens if you're going to

1370
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,159
breed

1371
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,920
so

1372
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,519
don't rush it you got to let them grow a

1373
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,440
little bit let them get in the flower

1374
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,719
let the let more than one pistol show

1375
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,480
you know what i'm saying let a good

1376
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,799
three week flower get on it before you

1377
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,039
put pollen on it so that's something i

1378
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,359
would agree with that yes

1379
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,759
this isn't my job right i have other

1380
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:00,719
businesses that i do as my income this

1381
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,880
is passion and fun my cannabis life is

1382
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,358
passion and fun that's the best way for

1383
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,119
it to be that's why i do it so

1384
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,239
that's right and so i'm just learning

1385
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,760
i'm learning still i don't know

1386
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,078
everything you don't need to know

1387
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,079
everything but it's just like growing

1388
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,480
you do not know unless you do it

1389
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,839
somebody can tell you this way this way

1390
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,000
this way all day but until you try it in

1391
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,239
your own environment you will not know

1392
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,679
for sure

1393
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,439
exactly

1394
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,679
that's right and it goes the same with

1395
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,119
breeders and stuff like i don't know

1396
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,799
every breeder but i do know the ones

1397
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,720
that i'm working their stuff with that i

1398
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,640
really want to know more the more i work

1399
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,558
with their stuff you know it's like

1400
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,558
and those are the only breeders i know

1401
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,400
but there's so many more out there so

1402
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,519
yeah i don't act you know and you don't

1403
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,280
either we don't act like we know

1404
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,639
everything no and that's a good way to

1405
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,519
be in this world because there's too

1406
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,358
much

1407
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,358
you need to specialize a little bit you

1408
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,279
know what i'm saying you need to shrink

1409
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,679
your focus down some and

1410
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,760
and not try to think you can do

1411
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,358
everything because you can't focus on a

1412
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,359
few things to be great at them that's

1413
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,519
what you want to do you never stop

1414
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,960
learning and then get other people's

1415
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,719
straight stuff

1416
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,358
yes never stop learning get great at

1417
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,118
what you do so you crossed it with a

1418
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,199
blueberry muffin that's why i'm really

1419
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,440
really interested in that blueberry bed

1420
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,159
that sounds amazing

1421
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,318
oh yeah yeah so i took the tk took the

1422
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,799
tk lb crosstalk with the blueberry

1423
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,800
muffin and that's called blueberry brass

1424
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,160
of course because the ladybug

1425
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,400
and because i can't think of any

1426
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,118
original names very well i never know

1427
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,559
but there's lots of those growing right

1428
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,280
now and

1429
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,319
i hope we get a blueberry cushy thing

1430
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,200
happening you know what i'm saying

1431
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:40,199
that's what i was hoping for

1432
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,759
blueberry that'd be cool crossed it with

1433
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:45,519
the neg champ but that sounds really

1434
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,000
good because i've been wanting to grow

1435
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,838

1436

that grim glue was one of the most

1491
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,680
beautiful plants that i had grown i had

1492
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,759
i took a picture of it on okay calyx

1493
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,639
page and it's a beautiful dark red color

1494
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,720
but

1495
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:11,759
the thing about the grim glues that i

1496
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:13,118
grew the the buds are just too small you

1497
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,880
know what i'm saying there are lots of

1498
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,318
them but they you know if you got a kind

1499
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,358
of a small boat on the planet it's going

1500
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:21,838
to dry up to a real small bud so

1501
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,000
when i was you know doing the com a lot

1502
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:27,679
of the commercial growing that just went

1503
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
to a fly so it got cut right oh man that

1504
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,480
was a great flavored one and the the

1505
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,199
consistency of that rosin too that was

1506
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,280
like butter butter it was straight

1507
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,679
butter and it came off it came out of

1508
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,280
the rosin bag and just when it hit

1509
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,000
cooler air it immediately went to that

1510
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,960
buttery look oh it was good stuff

1511
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,960

1570
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,318
nice dude yeah i've seen a lot of people

1571
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,000
growing out your genetics and you've

1572
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,318
been sharing it on your story and those

1573
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,159
plants look amazing so

1574
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,119
would it be fair to say

1575
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,039
that

1576
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,920
from your standpoint one of the things

1577
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,039
that you're breeding for is bag appeal

1578
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,920
and color

1579
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:21,039
well you know that yes now here let me

1580
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,920
say let me pre let me qualify all this

1581
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,440
as i've done breeding projects it's been

1582
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,920
for different reasons if you know what

1583
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,200
i'm saying and that g that that gdp was

1584
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,039
definitely because i was like i want

1585
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,239
that purple i just i don't care how i

1586
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,440
don't even know how good it tastes or

1587
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:35,519
not i just want to see if i can get

1588
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
color in another flower you know in its

1589
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,880
progeny

1590
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,919
and then with lady breath yes it was

1591
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,400
pretty but it was the triangle kush and

1592
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,039
it was the lineage of lady breath with

1593
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,960
that pan one citrus farmer

1594
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,639
that was definitely the draw that sealed

1595
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,039
it but yeah

1596
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,199
i'm a what a beauty [ __ ] like i said if

1597

1601
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,079

1602
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,160

1607
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,760
which one of your creations do you think

1608
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:21,598
represents okay calyx genetics the best

1609
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,200
like if there's one that somebody's

1610
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,920
gonna pick out

1611
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,558
and you're like this is the one that i

1612
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,318
want to represent what i'm doing here

1613
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,240

1614
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,000
i have to pick one

1615
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,078
you can pick three

1616
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,039
that's an e3

1617
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,280
max

1618
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:42,400

1620
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,838
isn't that an interesting question and i

1621
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,519
don't know if i've ever bred with that

1622
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,358
mentality in mind you know what i'm

1623
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,960
saying like i don't know if i ever said

1624
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:51,759
i want something to represent what i

1625
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,358
like

1626
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,520

cross like i'm really meaning to try to

1649
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,960
get this flavor out that made me send

1650
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:43,279
you some you know it was that dang good

1651
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,440
yeah appreciate it brother

1652
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,000
so you're really into blueberry not long

1653
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,280
ago you played a do or dab

1654
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,079
yes

1655
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,480
on our show on calyx and crew tv

1656
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,920
and you won some of those seeds from

1657
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,440
romneyland jake

1658
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,519
yes

1659
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,358
at romulan genetics

1660
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,679
did you have plans with those

1661
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:06,400
oh man did i

1662
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,159
the plans are going right now i have

1663
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,760
so i popped

1664
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,798
two seeds

1665
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,079
about

1666
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,400
two months ago both of them male

1667
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,240
i grew them out a little bit and i'm

1668
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,440
start and they look totally different

1669
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:21,279
and actually i was taught i've been

1670
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,480
talking with jake i had i was saying

1671
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:28,240
pictures of the two different looks

1672
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,480
one look had a thick inside you know

1673
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,558
big fat thick families kind of staying

1674
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,960
close to the branch

1675
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,160
and packing in nodes and then the the

1676
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,119
other male

1677
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:41,519
the families the stem was noticeably

1678
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,838
longer so much so that it seemed to open

1679
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,199
up the middle you know it seemed to be

1680
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:47,358
thin in the middle

1681
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:50,318
and so anyhow i threw it i cut i called

1682
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:52,000
the thin looking one and i kept that fat

1683
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:54,558
mean looking sucker

1684
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,559
and so i've got one romulan male that i

1685
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,359
know for sure is a male right now and i

1686
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,440
also have two new ramen blueberries that

1687
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,598
i popped about two weeks ago and they're

1688
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,798
about an inch tall right now and they're

1689
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,400
putting off

1690
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,759
i think they've gone through they're

1691
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,160
they're probably on third set of leaves

1692
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,200
cotyledon leaf and leaf right now

1693
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,719
nice

1694
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,519
i think that's going to be an excellent

1695
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:15,039
one

1696
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,358
so yes

1697
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:20,079
what i want i oh my lord have you seen

1698
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:22,798
it he put you know what was cool about

1699
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,960
it if people don't know is his pictures

1700
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,599
are amazing yeah yeah what people don't

1701
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,440
know is i got these and i had the mail

1702
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,519
already picked out that i wanted before

1703
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,000
he either released him to the public

1704
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,599
that's because uh the man doc calyx and

1705
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,280
romney and genetics giving them to me

1706
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,599
man that was cool feeling

1707
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,200
when he when he released him and romulan

1708
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,798
released it that day i took that

1709
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,239
snapshot and put my

1710
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:46,719
male picture right there with it and i

1711
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:50,159
was like here it is it's already growing

1712
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,318
so yes i have high hopes for

1713
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,558
romulan blueberry

1714
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:55,599
and i can't wait to to just get it in

1715
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,160
the mix

1716
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,680
and i here's my goal here's here's the

1717
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:02,399
goal that i've told a couple of testers

1718
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:05,039
that i work with is i want to get

1719
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,519
i want to get one blueberry strain that

1720
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,480
has you know four blueberry crosses in

1721
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,239
it

1722
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,960
and that's probably going to be

1723
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,558
blueberry muffin blueberry train mac raw

1724
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,000
meal and blueberry

1725
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,400
and um

1726
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,838
possibly blueberry cupcake from humboldt

1727
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,760
that i've got going

1728
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:23,679
and then i i've got another blueberry

1729
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,079
cumin and it's it's called african

1730
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:28,159
blueberry phenol number three and it's

1731
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,400
from black box genetics you told me

1732
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,920
about that black box genetics and so

1733
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,000
it's a it's a blueberry that has a

1734
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,639
sativa land raised cross in it

1735
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,960
so it's just a different maybe high or a

1736
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,598
feel you know blueberry is kind of on

1737
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,760
the indica side often so this is just a

1738
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,640
little different thing

1739
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,319
but again four blueberry crosses is my

1740
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:49,759
own personal thing that i just kind of

1741
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,599
want to have a blueberry strain that

1742
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,760
i've made that you know from four

1743
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,440
different blueberry crosses and if that

1744
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,480
don't have a blueberry turf to it i

1745
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,720
don't know what

1746
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,719
you know

1747
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,239
yeah so to answer your question

1748
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,759
blueberry squealer that one's going to

1749
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,279
define me right now

1750
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,160
oh man nice i appreciate that i haven't

1751
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,160
uh

1752
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,318
blueberry was never one of my biggest

1753
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,239
ones i do like the flavor but the high

1754
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:16,000
didn't typically work for me

1755
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,078
you've got to try out those blueberry

1756
