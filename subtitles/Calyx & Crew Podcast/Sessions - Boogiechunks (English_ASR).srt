17
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,459
I'm stoked to get into this because

18
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,560
there's so much that you touch on uh for

19
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,759
everybody that has no idea who you are

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,560
yet

21
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,060
um why don't we touch on what got you

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,700
into cannabis to begin with what was

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,739
your first experience

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,739
uh very unconventional Road uh uh so I

25
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,120
did not ever touch cannabis or anything

26
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:24,300
like that until about 18

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,219
uh prior to that all my friends would do

28
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,840
it and stuff like that I was always in

29
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,840
sports and [ __ ] and

30
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,738
it's never quite got into it all my

31
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,560
buddies were just really down for it

32
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,900
constantly and

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,340
over the course of time like

34
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,439
I started getting a little more

35
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,300
interested and just like they made it

36
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,400
seem so [ __ ] fun and everybody's

37
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,379
partying all the time

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,379
well then one day my buddy's going and

39
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:54,000
[ __ ] smoking a bowl and I see some

40
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,518
seeds they pulled out of the bud and I

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,739
was like so those things they just grow

42
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,180
like you just plant those he's like oh

43
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,980
yeah I did I [ __ ] do it all the time

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,319
it's wild it's like you just put them in

45
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,679
and then they just die and I'm like oh

46
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,079
all right oh cool man so I just went and

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,480
[ __ ] asked him for some he gave me

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,260
probably like 15 or so

49
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,939
I uh went home to my parents Garden made

50
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,579
this [ __ ] nice

51
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,800
railroad type box and did all this [ __ ]

52
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,120
like that and

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,939
[ __ ]

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,439
all this compost my parents grew up like

55
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,719
gardening and all that [ __ ] so they know

56
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,039
everything there is like it's kind of

57
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,919
origin for me

58
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,560
but I go and plant these [ __ ] seeds I

59
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,958
get a bunch of them to come up I think

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,539
ended up being six or so

61
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,239
I ended up going and growing them out

62
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:49,400
every day I'd go back there I'm like oh

63
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,400
very cool still a plant

64
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,760
you know over the course of time I don't

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,560
know anything about flowering it's I'm

66
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,179
just like okay well this does not look

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,479
like

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,500
like maybe it'll turn brown eventually

69
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,818
and uh I just [ __ ] eventually just

70
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,039
decided in the fall I'm like all right

71
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,438
well time to go pull these out chopped

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,378

73
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,479
all in this giant [ __ ] Hefty bag and

74
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,039
then threw them in my trunk and went to

75
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,620

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,560

97
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,460
situation so we called some buddies over

98
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:14,100
we're trimming it

99
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:16,258
I still have not smoked and we're

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,120
sitting there and dudes like

101
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,759
so like have you tried it yet I'm like

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,620
no I've never tried weed and he's like

103
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,460
oh

104
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,319
well do you do you want to

105
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,138
um from then on like

106
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,819
just grab some weed we threw it in a

107
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,519
[ __ ] Bowl wet as [ __ ] it was

108
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,978
disgusting [ __ ] burn like [ __ ] oh

109
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,500
[ __ ] and then

110
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,199
got high right away

111
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,879
felt awesome loved it and then we just

112
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,560
started doing it like every day since

113
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,060
and

114
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
I don't know I feel like there's

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,360
something to come from that of going and

116
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
like

117
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,560
growing for my buddies that were just

118
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,939
spending twenty dollars constantly on

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,120
like weed

120
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,879
and just growing it for them just

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,519
I don't know I feel like it set me on a

122
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,800
different track than some other people I

123
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,779
guess that sometimes get into weed

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,720
originally so

125
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,339
I don't know absolutely definitely a

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,020
different story than most people that's

127
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,179
pretty cool though that your very first

128
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,279
experience smoking cannabis was your own

129
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,160
[ __ ] you know even if it was wet and

130
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,379
green and stuff that's cool man I

131
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,000
remember like at the same time like this

132
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,918
dude just brought over this bag of just

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,839
this nasty brown stuff and he was like

134
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,299
whoa like

135
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,560
where did that come from I'm like oh I

136
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,860
mean like

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,079
me I guess and he's like could I have

138
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,000
some and then we just started like

139
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,758
giving it away to everybody we never

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,620
[ __ ] we never sold a bit of it I

141
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,660
that's not what I was in for from the

142
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,699
start so it's just like right away it

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,080
was just like all our buddies there we

144
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,960
got four buddies and they're calling

145
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,300
their friends they're like hey man

146
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:59,399
there's a garbage bag of pot that is

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,900
just open to the masses and everything

148
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:06,299
oh all right cool so animals

149
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:09,000
yeah it was it was fun and I don't know

150
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,300
I I think I was fortunate to go and have

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,500
that be my like first experience because

152
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,319
it just immediately took off into like a

153
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,000
oh like chasing that feeling of making

154
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,340
that many people happy with something

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,439
like that you know like I don't know

156
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,119
it's

157
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,399
it's a cool lesson to learn like really

158
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,860
early on that's pretty damn cool really

159
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,560
and yeah you know when we were talking

160
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,538
earlier you definitely made a point

161
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,000
kind of what you were just saying about

162
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,699
the difference between people that grow

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,259
cannabis for money and people that are

164
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,939
also putting their time into growing

165
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,220
other plants and learning how to grow

166
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:50,459
other plants not just cannabis that

167
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,160
that's gonna really

168
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,500
bring up your status as a grower and how

169
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,840
you understand plants dealing with more

170
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,519
than just cannabis you know

171
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,560
um definitely not in it for the money

172
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,939
and in it for the love of cultivation I

173
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,240
think that's pretty awesome that you do

174
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,339
that man oh yeah dude it's it's a sad

175
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,038

176
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,679
like process you know like

177

178
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,519

179
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,439

I'm there for it it seems like there's a

215
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,159
ton of other people there are there for

216
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,720
it too rather than just like going and

217
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,719
snapping at each other and just making

218
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,540
[ __ ] shitty jokes like

219
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,300
it's it's a very cool thing that you

220
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,278
started here it's uh it's fun to be part

221
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,799
of it and it's it's cool that people

222
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,720
actually want to learn it's like I don't

223
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,120
come across too much of that talking to

224
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,778
like all the commercial dudes I hang out

225
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,179
with and like it's just uh just a nine

226
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,559
to five for them and it's just they at

227
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,479
the end of the day they don't want to

228
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,579
talk about it and if they do want to

229
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,560
talk about it's boring as [ __ ] where

230
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,200
it's like you guys you're open to like

231
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,059
well what part of Africa and why would

232
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,480
that part of Africa have a different

233
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:30,239
leaf type than Northern Africa and it

234
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,700
that's cool like questions are fun and

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,339
it's cool that you guys asked Dominic

236
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,200
[ __ ] yeah dude that's my [ __ ] I mean

237
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,540
that's something that I really liked

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,459
about you Dave obviously he does a lot

239
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,899
of really cool old lines like that that

240
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,518
I'm into

241
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,620
um I appreciate the [ __ ] that you not

242
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,200
only do those old lines but you're also

243
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,879
working with other heirlooms from

244
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,160
different varieties such as like peppers

245
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,259
and things like this oh yeah um so it's

246
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,059
you're a wealth of knowledge even for

247
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,399
people like me that have got into land

248
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,659
races but may have not touched this

249
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,879
different region or this different

250
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,439
region we're looking for something you

251
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,299
have that experience where you can speak

252
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,820
on that and that's that's a wealth of

253
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,439
information for somebody like me uh even

254
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,500
some of the new growers in our chat I'm

255
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,820
sure that's just like you know if I had

256
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
that to begin with that would have been

257
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,959
awesome but like you were saying you

258
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,379
know some of those early form days

259
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,139
I I'm specifically thinking of icmeg

260
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,320
right now and how hostile it was all the

261
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,319
time

262
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,539
man I'm trying to learn [ __ ] over here

263
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,039
yeah that's terrifying I mean it was a

264
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,799
different it was a different day and

265
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,419
time you know yeah so it's really cool

266
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,639
that we have something like that now and

267
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,039
that's what I was trying to create is an

268
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,958
environment that was everything the old

269
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,360
form should have been

270
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,458
um that I was hoping Instagram would

271
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,560
have been when I got on it and it turned

272
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:57,539
into more you know the commercial and

273
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,338
the bickering and arguing I just I don't

274
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,019
have time for that I'm here to learn I'm

275
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,839
here to Steward the plant and I want to

276
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,240
help people you know yeah I'm really

277
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,180
glad you're over there yeah Instagram's

278
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,539
done it started off pretty cool but man

279
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:15,539
it has turned into a disservice almost I

280
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:18,659
feel like yeah fast it's it's a target

281
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:21,000
for especially cannabis Growers

282
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:23,399
well it's like a petri dish it's [ __ ]

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,100
nuts man like you go and have like

284
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,980
one little [ __ ] go and make a comment

285
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,860
and then it just spawns out like a

286
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,778
[ __ ] Colony it's that's insane and

287
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,879
then like these people just get drunk

288
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,439
who just make a joke or do something

289
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,899
they just [ __ ] get drugged through

290
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,139
the mud and then they like [ __ ]

291
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:45,600
people going and throwing [ __ ] like

292
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,399
people's information out there and all

293
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,459
this kind of stuff it just gets wild

294
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,278
real quick and it's just like that's

295
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,679
I don't want to be part of that exactly

296
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,019
yeah it's not only that but Jesus Christ

297
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,078
talk about a [ __ ] like one-sided

298
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,459
platform of just like a cookies

299
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,819
dispensary it's just like everybody

300
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:09,539
that's all anybody [ __ ] does and it's

301
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:12,480
just this gelato and this cookie but

302
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,679
it's basically all cookies so speaking

303
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,060
of which how's your cookies project

304
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,620
turned out oh God I got two in this

305
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:22,199
miserable they're in the corner they're

306
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,440
probably gonna be gorgeous and

307
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,639
smell like pie dough and

308
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,260
get thrown in a compost pile

309
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,419
Oh come on there's got to be something

310
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,559
good out there yeah the chickens will

311
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,778
like it it'll be

312
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,299
fine I'll say I'll say I've had uh

313
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:42,600
actually went and picked up some cookies

314
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,699
earlier today believe it or not I found

315
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,100
one that I'm

316
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,800
okay with I'm pretty decent with this by

317
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,220
Gary Payton okay that one's okay that

318
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,219
one's been

319
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,360
it's not a long lasting high it's

320
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,278
definitely not up to par with something

321
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,959
special you find out of a land race like

322
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,360
hazy that's going to blow you out for a

323
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,458
couple hours yeah yeah um but it's

324
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,200
decent out of everything that's coming

325
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,000
out cookies it's one of the decent ones

326
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,000
I would say and I've grown a few of them

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,078
and about the same results as you just

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,299
meh

329
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,099
you know not not super stoked about it

330
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:20,578
but that one's all right it's got a

331
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,019
purpose man like and like I I say this

332
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:23,338
concept and it's like just because it's

333
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,440
not for me doesn't mean it's not for

334
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,700
everybody else exactly that is totally

335
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,300
cool and

336
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,700
I have a cookie cut like not it's not

337
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:36,240
like a cookie cut it's a or it's called

338
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,240
orange freeze it's a [ __ ] orange

339
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,639
cookie crossed with sour alien sour

340
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,519
apple IBL and it was just a selected

341
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,980
Fino from the local area

342
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,799
the [ __ ] plant rips if you go and

343
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,800
smoke it like a month after it's [ __ ]

344
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,778
harvested it doesn't do a [ __ ] dick

345
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,838
to you like

346
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:59,278
no hide I remember like giving it to my

347
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,440
buddy we both finished at the same time

348
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,600
we both hadn't just like it tastes

349
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,180
awesome and he's like wow it tastes so

350
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,940
good and then [ __ ] in unison we're

351
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:11,879
like doesn't do a [ __ ] drop of

352
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,639
anything and

353
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,620
it was just so disappointing so we both

354
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,659
just like shelf the thing and just sat

355
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,679
it there for like probably another month

356
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,480
or so

357
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,278
and then we go and like crack it and

358
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,079
it's like opening a [ __ ] jar of

359
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,600
chlorine for your pool and it's just

360
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,239
like this [ __ ] like whoa like this

361
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,699
just like it's like somebody dumped a

362
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,339
bag of oranges and just like a high

363
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:38,159
chlorinated water it's just this weird

364
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:41,540
[ __ ] like orange it just sounds good

365
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,338
though oh it's [ __ ] fantastic

366
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,778
I'll talk so much [ __ ] on cookies but I

367
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:49,560
have one and it's like my favorite thing

368
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,939
yeah is that the one that was showing

369
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,518
the gestation

370
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,300
no no so that was another one from

371
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,600
another uh local buddy uh it was a

372
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,919
gelato the gelato cut that they call

373
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,620
jello

374
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,019
costs with the creamsicle four and then

375
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,519
I hit it with pollen from a Fruity

376
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,000
Pebbles OG

377
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,360
so my pollen onto his

378
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,100
clone and I just wanted to

379
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,560
if somebody gives me a cut it's fun to

380
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,000
go and like make something with it and

381
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,859
then grow it out and then give them

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,539
seeds and be like this is what you can

383
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,899
expect with that thing that you gave me

384
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:29,879
that I made stuff with it's just uh

385
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,339
so I was just kind of like doing a

386
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,360
little side project for him and it's

387
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,620
just like

388
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,620
it's just miserable

389
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,019
can't all be winners I mean oh God like

390
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,659
most people ever expect any breeder any

391
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,100
preservation Niche to make fire every

392
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,719
single time that's part of it we're

393
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,820
playing around trying to see what works

394
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
you know but Jesus man like [ __ ]

395
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,759
Instagram will go and make you think

396
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,500
everybody's just [ __ ] nailing oh yeah

397
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,500
everything's a trophy wife picture up

398
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,099
there yeah

399
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,380
no wrong show me your mids I want to see

400
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,480
them

401
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,459
so we talked about your early days in

402
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,980
the Cannabis and what got you into

403
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,179
smoking cannabis when did it change when

404
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,860
were you like

405
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm gonna start breeding this I'm gonna

406
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:22,458
start trying to make some types that are

407
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,459
unique to Boogie jumps

408
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,539
and after like the original Like Me

409
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,179
growing stuff

410
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,759
it took off pretty quick after that and

411
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,580
it was just one of those things that I

412
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,220
was I slowly like met a whole new group

413
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:43,500
of friends they were all into Punk

414
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,798
we started going to just punk shows

415
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,940
constantly all these like folk shows

416
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:53,879
like just weird when I say [ __ ] I'd

417
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,700
yes lots of banjos and other odd

418
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,500
instruments made in the 1600s but also

419
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,000
these dudes would like just [ __ ] rip

420
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,460
and they'd always play with like these

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,599
crazy like house punk bands

422
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,640
it's cool [ __ ] I I have not seen much of

423
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,439
that outside of the Midwest but it was

424
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,600
just like these boys that would get down

425
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,038
but everybody will always smoke pot and

426
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,019
everybody was always like bringing

427
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,819
different cuts like not Cuts but like

428
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,558
different nugs of different cuts around

429
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:21,359
and that's when I just started getting

430
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,298
interested I was like

431
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,339
if I remember like 11g the first time

432
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:27,900
and just like somebody like I'm like

433
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,178
what the [ __ ] is it because like prior

434
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,519
to that it's just like it just smelled

435
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:35,700
like pot to me like

436
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,619
just just nothing like oh that's dang

437
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,200
but it's also because I was just

438
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:43,079
constantly smoking like un-dried [ __ ]

439
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,620
just shitty weed or brick so then I

440
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,960
smell lemon G I was like whoa

441
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,459
weed does that and he's like yeah and

442
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,679
he's like here's this other stuff and he

443
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,519
starts like showing us some I remember

444
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,798
like there was a G13 at one point that

445
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:03,480
was just like [ __ ]

446
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:06,058
in just Pine bomb just weird

447
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,400
Midwest G13 thing that would go around

448
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:11,819
it's like kind of like Pine Piney

449
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,160
cleaner almost not like OG but

450
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:16,379
and that's where hanging around these

451
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,660
bands going and smoking all these

452
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,880
different types of [ __ ] weed and just

453
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,558
seeing people being like Oh yeah here's

454
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,419
like some fresh Buds and stuff like that

455
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,740
everything at the time was coming out of

456
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,559
like

457
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,880
probably Columbus area we'd see them

458
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,500
like

459
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,480
everything that was all around the

460
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,700
Midwest like that was really good just

461
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,620
seemed like it came out of Columbus

462
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,600
but that's where it just took off and

463
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:41,459
then after that I just started

464
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,918
collecting seeds constantly and that's

465
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,120
where I got into names because otherwise

466
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,100
I was just like for the longest time

467
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,678
just throwing seeds in a [ __ ] bag and

468
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,939
like oh yeah here's my bag of weed seeds

469
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,880
there's no difference and then I start

470
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,298
hearing names I was like oh

471
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,100
so this is four-way and they're like

472
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,298
yeah but it's like Ohio far away I'm

473
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,178
like yeah but this one's four-way

474
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:05,279
they're like no that's a different

475
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,919
four-way so it's just like a huge

476
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,019
learning process and

477
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
the more I got into it I'm like oh this

478
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,519
is actually just like flowers oh this is

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,558
just like Peppers oh this is like

480
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,418
I grew up like gardening and doing all

481
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,819
these things with my parents and [ __ ] so

482
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:23,220
like for some reason I thought that like

483
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,839
weed was this Enigma especially because

484
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,120
like when I first grew it I was like

485
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,000
there's a boy and a girl like everything

486
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,058
else is just oh yeah let's [ __ ]

487
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,740
so I think that was probably some of the

488
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:35,940
best points of growing when you don't

489
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,160
know anything

490
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,200
and there's so much to learn that the

491
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,759
world was exciting you know and then it

492
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,038
it gets to a point where you're like

493
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,538
where do I go from here what's the next

494
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:47,038
rabbit hole and it's cool when you find

495
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,839
that rabbit hole but you gotta start

496
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,000
like searching out for it instead of

497
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,399
everything being new you know well you

498
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,259

499
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,120
people tell you you're [ __ ] like if

500

503
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,319
like somebody has to come up and be like

504

505

00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,700
like get your feelings hurt man

507
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,440

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,538
and have people tell you you're [ __ ]

509
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,058
like if you're surrounded by yes dudes

510
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,759

511
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:26,099

512
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,900
anything like somebody has to come up

513
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,779
and be like dude this weed sucks and

514
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,419
this is why and it's like exactly

515
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,700
like get your feelings hurt man they

516
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,020
can't all be winners I was taught I was

517
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,759
actually talking to the guys in the

518
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,759
Discord about that the other day I was

519
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,839
saying it's not that hard to find a good

520
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,119
female

521
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:49,918
it's hard much harder to take good ones

522
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,139
and be able to say okay I'm gonna [ __ ]

523
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,960
off with those ones because this one is

524
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,400
actually a step above that exactly

525
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,319
there's good and then there's

526
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,820
exceptional you know

527
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,500
yeah it's a narrow line too yeah you

528
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,720
can't keep it

529
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,480
that's a and yeah it's sometimes the

530
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,240
best ones are the ugliest ones yeah I'll

531
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,279
have ones that I'll just have for like

532
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,779
a couple years and I never flower I'm

533
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:21,240
like but maybe like

534
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,240
the entire time I have like hundreds of

535
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,159
seeds of that exact thing that there's

536
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,159
probably a way better one in but I'm

537
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,820
like this one was cool that one time

538
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:35,159
it was good I tried it before yeah so

539
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,879
it's just a magician says I knew Hagrid

540
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,880
grew weed

541
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,000
that's better so

542
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,960
um this isn't the first time I've heard

543
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,640
you throw out that lemon G would it be

544
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,240
accurate to say that's one of your

545
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,240
favorite types

546
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,599
um but man people either love it or hate

547
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,520
it and it was wild because I remember

548
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,099
for the longest time

549
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:18,000
if you've never smelled or tried lemon G

550
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:21,359
like and you smell it and it's like what

551
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,099
in the [ __ ] is this pot like it's just

552
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,779
this gnarly pungent [ __ ] like

553
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:30,119
it's

554
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:32,339
lemony but it has that almost like that

555
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,259
burn off of feels like skunk does but

556
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:37,079
it's not skunky like that it's like

557
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:39,779
skunk one e kinda like and that's not

558
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:42,658
doing it justice like it's a really hard

559
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:44,158
lemon profile to go and explain but it

560
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,860
is just like

561
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,600
Nostalgia wise that was like for me the

562
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,099
reason why it's one of my favorites is

563
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,839
just because it's the one weed that

564
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:53,939
could just like

565
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,879
it's the beginning

566
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,220
was that one from like exclusive to your

567
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,140
area because like I was talking to you

568
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,819
about earlier we saw it quite a bit up

569
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,880
here that lemon G was actually pretty

570
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:08,879
popular in Washington yeah as soon as

571
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,860
things took off over in California and

572
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,260
well there was a lot of people that went

573
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,639
and migrated over to Colorado for a

574
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,519
minute from

575
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,320
the Midwest and then lemon G just

576
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,759
circulate around same with like Indiana

577
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,158
bubble gum

578
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,619
[ __ ] it if you lived anywhere in the

579
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,679
midwest the you could find probably

580
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:31,139
lemon G the Indiana bubble gum there

581
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,780
were several different G13 Cuts Death

582
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,460
Star went around some of the states

583
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,500
you could just

584
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,100
there was a handful that were just

585
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,700
always around Michigan like [ __ ]

586
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,918
dumpster was around pretty often but

587
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,620
over the course of time as these states

588
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,620
opened up and people got less and less

589
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,940
popular around here

590
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,859
they kind of shot over to the West

591
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,480
slowly there was a bunch of people that

592
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,740
landed over in Colorado there were a

593
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,140
bunch of people that landed over in

594
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,200
Oregon Washington

595
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,659
different parts of California that took

596
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,640
these Cuts so lemon G definitely made it

597
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,960
over there at some point

598
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,780
um

599
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,340
I I heard from like the forums I

600
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:19,918
remember like specifically like I see

601
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:22,259
mag like because I would just go through

602
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,120
there because like at the time I just

603
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,319
I could never find a cut or anything

604
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,719
like that

605
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,639
and I just didn't know that many girl

606
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,259
everybody was so quiet that nobody

607
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,940
[ __ ] talked to each other so nobody

608
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,919
knew each other grew and then it's like

609
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,778
slowly you find out it's like I've known

610
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,059
you for like eight years and like we

611
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:41,099
both have the same [ __ ] Hobby and

612
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:43,399
they're like oh yeah but like don't tell

613
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,399
anyone

614
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,640
so

615
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:50,939
finally get a hold of like a cut but

616
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,580
yeah Washington they got it pretty

617
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,019
intense man I didn't realize that I had

618
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:58,619
talked to you back

619
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:01,558
couple years ago I I was pretty sure I

620
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:03,778
just met you right through AK oh yeah it

621
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,019
was like I remember because it was right

622
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,019
as

623
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,860
so I took a long break like

624
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,960
a few years and uh

625
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:19,079
just

626
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,179
I don't know I got into Instagram for a

627
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,099
minute I used to do like tons of Art and

628
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,440
like I do cooking and all this other

629
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:27,058
[ __ ] so it was like this thing and then

630
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,278
one day like a weed plant popped up and

631
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:31,859
I was like whoa like Instagram does weed

632
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,599

633
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,298
yeah and

634
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,699
I I just found a couple different

635
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:41,220
[ __ ] pages and somehow I came across

636
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,440

637
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,960

yeah so so at the time it was like over

723
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,820
the course of the years I found out that

724
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,919
around that same time

725
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:31,259
[ __ ] uh Bodhi around 2007 2009 or

00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,700
something like that did his deep chunk

727
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,640
pollination of all these different

728
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,100
things and he made a line called Gunk

729
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,460
with an exclamation point specifically

730
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:44,219
and it was an afghoo deep chunk

731
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:48,298
the people around that I've heard have

732
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,740
grown it say that it was a G13 deep

733
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,339
chunk

734
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,339

881
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:53,039
type of search on my own like rather

882
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:54,358
than just going through all these

883
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,480
different people that live in these

884
00:36:54,358 --> 00:37:00,239
areas like I want to go so

885
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,400
he ended up going and taking off over to

886
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,598
Africa

887
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,519
and he sent me

888
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,920
a lot of his [ __ ] Library as far as

889
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,539
like land race seed stock he took a ton

890
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,079
with him out there to go and do rape

891
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:19,199
repopulations and his own expansions on

892
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,820
the lines and stuff like that which

893
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,439
[ __ ] yeah

894
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,539
and uh

895
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,659
yeah I'm just gonna do some of the same

896
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:30,719
here if anything for myself and just to

897
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:32,759
go and experience these things that

898
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,500
some of the highs that I just haven't

899
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,880
been able to go and experience and I

900
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,960
don't think many other like I don't know

901
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,780
what the [ __ ] a Peruvian weed is like

902
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,720
exactly about to find out that's the

903
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,839
most uh exciting part for me and why I

904
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,299
like doing land races so much in uh in a

905
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,420
world where we bald neck so much stuff

906
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,420
and even if it's not the same thing a

907
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,960
lot of things are very very similar like

908
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:03,420
they're not all lemon is lemon but a

909
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,820
lemon G is a lemon this is a lemon this

910
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,338
you know Lemon Haze is a lemon skunk is

911
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,099
a you know they're very similar in

912
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:14,578
finding uh different effects and

913
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:17,460
different flavor profiles especially

914
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,980
um that have like that no ceiling or you

915
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,960
can pick your CBD cultivar out of it or

916
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,240
you know you can go so many different

917
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,280
directions with land races it's

918
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,959
constantly exciting for me you know it

919
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,660
keeps you on your toes too as a grower

920
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,500
oh dude it she keeps hearing your toe

921
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:37,139
opposed to the entire [ __ ] time

922
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:40,380
like they do I got add man I can't slow

923
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,960
down I need that [ __ ] it makes no sense

924
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,300
like they'll do things never seen before

925
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,159
against like they'll just shoot it's

926
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,619
like it'll be like a regular plant and

927
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,299
then it's like I'm a Vine now and then

928
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,000
it just calls it quits on like having

929
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,160
stability they'll grow like these crazy

930
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,619
wispy little [ __ ] branches all over

931
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,559
the place they'll throw [ __ ] like

932
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:04,019
exterior roots that go and [ __ ] tap

933
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:06,779
down in the dirt they [ __ ] go and

934
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:09,599
grow like almost like

935
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,720
like uh

936
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,300
these Leaf surface Thorn sections that

937
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,559
go and [ __ ] like it's weird man it's

938
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,140
always around the petiole but they'll

939
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,880
throw these little like horns on them

940
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:24,239
there's so many different [ __ ] things

941
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,280
about wheat that we have no [ __ ] clue

942
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,559
about and that are just hiding all over

943
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,720
the [ __ ] world it's like as soon as

944
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,639
like the internet took off

945
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,379
like as far as like weed things and

946
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,838
people start posting their own

947
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,599
experiences for [ __ ] Jamaica or like

948
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,219
some dudes over in the Middle East and

949
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,780
[ __ ] and you're seeing like what's going

950
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,219
on it's just like your eyes just start

951
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,320
opening and opening and then once you

952
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,358
start actually like putting your hands

953
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,880
in the dirt with these plants from these

954
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,920
places it's just like oh this is nothing

955
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,720
what I expected they'll go and surprise

956
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,639
you every [ __ ] time with the

957
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,358
exception of Africans interpineling for

958
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,358
some [ __ ] reason

959
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:03,960
but yeah

960
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,320
yeah we okay so we gotta talk about that

961
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,599
the turbina lane in the Congo because

962
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,579
and the reason I ask is because I've got

963
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,180
a friend over in Lesotho

964
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:17,700
and uh he sent me a bunch of crosses he

965
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:20,879
was working with the Congo uh he made a

966
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:23,098
few hybrids with it even sent me uh an

967
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,619
isolation he did of the broad leaf

968
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,180
phenotype that he found in it and a

969
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,920
narrow Leaf phenotype so he kind of

970
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:30,719
separated those out I love to get you

971
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,240
over some too

972
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,039
um but I don't know if you'd enjoy them

973
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,719
because you said everything that you

974
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:41,279
were fighting that had the Congo cross

975
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,419
and it was heavy terpenoling and yeah so

976
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,880
and

977
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,680
if not any smack Hunter penaltying there

978
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,079
there's tons of people that love it it

979
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,279
does great things it's a great precursor

980
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,440
and [ __ ] but it's just like I'm

981
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,380
interested in here is it can express

982
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,179
itself in so many different ways

983
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,180
depending on what that cannabinoid

984
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:01,919
profile is so when you say terpenolene

985
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:05,039
what which one are you pulling out of

986
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,519
that is it like that if there is so

987
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,619
there is this base undertone that just

988
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,838
goes in like hovers throughout all of

989
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:15,780
them for me like I could just pick it

990
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:17,940
out it's dominant it's just there and

991
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,220
that's all I can taste and I it's

992
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,679
definitely probably just my own mental

993
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:24,179
perception of the thing is just like I

994
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,239
had to find something I didn't like you

995
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:29,279
know and for whatever reason it ended up

996
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,959
being that ter profile I'm just not a

997
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,820
huge fan of it like

998
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,940
and

999
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,700
don't get me wrong the the Congo

1000
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:42,599
it was Congo kendalla Kim

1001
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:45,239
and bag appeal [ __ ]

1002
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,059
beautiful like incredible

1003
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:51,118
great resin coverage the inside of it

1004
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,799
does this like in it seemed to be pretty

1005
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,019
common throughout like a bunch of The

1006
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,839
Congos it's like

1007
00:41:55,019 --> 00:42:00,300
close to the actual stem it'll have like

1008
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,940
a much tackier like

1009
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,000
resin content it's like it'll have like

1010
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,460
this great surface coverage of trichomes

1011
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,260
and you know like they go through the

1012
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,880
leaves and all that [ __ ] but like for

1013
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,800
some reason like right at the actual

1014
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,680
like stem base it you would break it it

1015
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,440
just like it would just [ __ ] tack

1016
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,858
it'd probably be awesome and [ __ ]

1017
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,820
extraction and all that kind of [ __ ] but

1018
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:25,819
not for me

1019
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,460
well Lesotho though that you said like

1020
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:35,099
Lesotho is [ __ ] Wicked that [ __ ] is

1021
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:37,139
some good stuff I've grown quite a few

1022
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,820
Africans but I have not touched that

1023
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:40,799
Lesotho yet

1024
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,940
what'd you like about that one

1025
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,500
dude

1026
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,599
a profile

1027
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,039
just straight like

1028
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,320
shitty

1029
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:52,858
restaurant fried rice

1030
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,599
it was just oh [ __ ] nice yeah it did it

1031
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:58,619
was weird man like there's like the

1032
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,079
sesame oil like so I cook like a lot uh

1033
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:03,180
I used to be restaurants and all that

1034
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,000
[ __ ] yeah then it's just like

1035
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,440
we translate so easily with the smell

1036
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,760
and The Taste and stuff like that so

1037
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,500
it's like a lot of the [ __ ] that I talk

1038
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,960
about is just gonna be mostly like

1039
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,780
culinary like bass so it's like that's

1040
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,079
just my best association so fried rice

1041
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,079
man

1042
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,219
straight out the park

1043
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,960
and that's probably a flavor profile

1044
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:28,259
most people know too

1045
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,019
oh yeah it was like

1046
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,859
it didn't necess it was as far as like

1047
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:37,940
Flavor like it had like uh some

1048
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:40,799
herbaceous notes some uh almost like

1049
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,139
eucalyptusy thing which was kind of not

1050
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,180
expected but like more so like a peanut

1051
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,159
butter thing like if you were to go and

1052
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,078
make like a paint like a sesame paste

1053
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,299
kinda but like really light on that

1054
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:53,818
everything else was like kind of like uh

1055
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:57,960
like I find I keep finding like a lot of

1056
00:43:53,818 --> 00:44:00,659
like these eucalyptusy like minty like I

1057
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,000
just refer to them as teal profiles so

1058
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:06,000
it's just like it

1059
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,219
yeah and with that in the peanut buttery

1060
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,559
thing The Taste was cool still really

1061
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:12,358
subtle it wasn't like a terp bomb but

1062
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,460
like the smell you would crack it and

1063
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,259
it's like you just brought in a bag of

1064
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,440
[ __ ] fried rice

1065
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,619
it's great that's pretty cool man I like

1066
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,619
that

1067
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,039
so you said you're gonna kind of venture

1068
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,339
away from some of that stuff and you're

1069
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:33,239
gonna start doing more affys and Pakis

1070
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:35,338
yeah that's the whole hopes I'm gonna

1071
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:39,118
I've always really liked the indicas the

1072
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:41,759
land race is uh uh that's kind of like

1073
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,358
so the out of the Peru seeds I have I

1074
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,660
have these Peru cross with mazara Sharif

1075
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:51,838
and those ones seem really interesting

1076
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:53,940
to me I'm gonna probably end up doing I

1077
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,279
think I got like

1078
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,800
around 20 of them so I'll do an open

1079
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,980
pollination of them and then just do a

1080
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:06,180
segregation of that population

1081
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,000
keep a couple cuts and then just try to

1082
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:10,919
see what can come out of like that kind

1083
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,559
of hybrid once again I know nothing

1084
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,838
about Peruvian stuff but like I know

1085
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,519
Casey brains was Finding like a ton of

1086
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,799
really awesome [ __ ] down in South

1087
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,900
America like in the 90s and all that

1088
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,019
kind of stuff so and then with White

1089
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,960
Widow being partial Brazilian like

1090
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:31,880
there's a lot of cool [ __ ] hiding in

1091
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,880
South America that I know nothing about

1092
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,358
so yeah I'm glad you pointed out Casey

1093
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,159
brains the other day because [ __ ] I

1094
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,960
hadn't even looked at those seats for a

1095
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,519
while I hadn't even heard his name in a

1096
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,920
while I didn't there's not much doing

1097
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,960
anything anymore man

1098
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,639
yeah dude he basically does the same

1099
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,380
thing Modi does he just goes around and

1100
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:51,118
[ __ ] collects seeds from around the

1101
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,559
world and it's just like

1102
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,300
I don't know we were talking about this

1103
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,219
the other day it's like that dude should

1104
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,339
get a lot more [ __ ]

1105
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:02,519
well you made a good point too like he

1106
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:04,139
was the guy that wasn't like naming most

1107
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:07,380
of his stuff he was kind of doing like

1108
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:10,500
the number uh nomenclature if you will

1109
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,760
and I I guess those names just didn't

1110
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,460
stick like

1111
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,300
an actual like you know the candy treat

1112
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,720
names [ __ ] sure like

1113
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,720
I heard

1114
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,019
[ __ ] like it was like initials and

1115
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,000
then like the number it wasn't even like

1116
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,559
relative to like a [ __ ] phenotype I

1117
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,300
guess it was just his age when he made

1118
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,179
the line

1119
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,619
so it's like Casey oh [ __ ] yeah that's

1120
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:41,338
what I've heard I don't know if that's

1121
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:43,619
[ __ ] true so nah that can't be

1122
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:47,159
I don't feel like they're

1123
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,720
what was it a 36 and a 45 yeah

1124
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,618
yeah I feel like those were pretty close

1125
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,618
to when they came out

1126
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,399
I don't know that I mean that he was

1127
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,619
already out by the time I really got

1128
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,720
into cannabis so it's hard to say we'd

1129
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,760
need it

1130
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:04,379
like already set aside at the time I

1131
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,660
don't know much about the guy personally

1132
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,160
like this is just you know like I said

1133
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:09,960
hearsay

1134
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,358
but uh

1135
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,699
yeah he made some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] his

1136
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:17,159
you could still find like really like

1137
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:21,358
the 36 was

1138
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,920
super fruity like crazy Turfs almost all

1139
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,440
of them there was there was a couple

1140
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,740
swaggy ones for sure but like

1141
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,900
growing his stuff in like 2000

1142
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:35,098
was that

1143
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:37,260
like 10 something like that it was

1144
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:41,039
[ __ ] cool [ __ ] and then there's a guy

1145
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,200
like Santa Rosa terp Farm or Urban

1146
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,838
Turf Farm or something like that he's

1147
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,519
using all these Casey brain stuff with

1148
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,078
the sour diesels and making these new

1149
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,940
washer strains

1150
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,859
so I don't know

1151
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,480
it's cool that people are coming across

1152
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:56,460
him again and

1153
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,559
he seems to be going out and doing new

1154
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,659
collections so it'd be cool if something

1155
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,219
neat came out

1156
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:04,019
hell yeah dude

1157
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:05,818
so you

1158
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:07,920
were very [ __ ] generous and you

1159
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:09,619
blessed me with this gigantic bag of

1160
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,200
[ __ ] fire

1161
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:16,500
and I see a few crosses in there with

1162
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:18,719
one that you made me drool about in the

1163
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,239
Discord and that was that dumpster hash

1164
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,098
plant that we I don't know much about

1165
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,618
that in the Pacific Northwest I haven't

1166
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:27,660
heard much about it can you Enlighten us

1167
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,960
as to what the dumpster hash plan is

1168
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:32,219
yeah it's not so it's my favorite

1169
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,639
where's

1170
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:39,358
it is my favorite it is the one thing

1171
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:41,940
that I always have it's a

1172
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,619
it's just a [ __ ] clone I found in a

1173
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,139
bag of uh

1174
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:48,059
Bodhi seeds that I pop for fun it was

1175
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:50,699
just like this [ __ ] one that just

1176
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:52,440
stuck out and

1177
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:54,719
at the same time I was doing like a

1178
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,818
bunch of panamas and Bubbas and like

1179
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,500
different things like that and then I

1180
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:59,460
just had these like [ __ ] shitty

1181
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,099
little

1182
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,619
dumpster hash plants going and they just

1183
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,900
would not grow for the life of them and

1184
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,300
I just kind of wrote them off and

1185
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,160
I took clones of everything and just

1186
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,079
back up or whatever

1187
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,480
and

1188
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:18,420
at the end of it it's just like there's

1189
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:22,619
one [ __ ] just caked little [ __ ]

1190
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:28,019
plant and it had this crazy like dryer

1191
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:30,599
sheet and Curry [ __ ] profile it like

1192
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:31,800
like cleaning products but like also

1193
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:35,880
just like

1194
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:38,220
a nasty yellow curry and uh

1195
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,380
start going I scope it and [ __ ] the

1196
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:43,919
heads look [ __ ] awesome big bulbous

1197
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,559
things no [ __ ] stock really and

1198
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,200
the lowers they [ __ ] stocked out like

1199
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,400
crazy so it's it was like a neat little

1200
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,960
[ __ ]

1201
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,700
neat little plant I've never seen

1202
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,619
anything quite like it there were a

1203
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:58,679
couple like similar in the batch but

1204
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:00,539
like this Curry thing was just

1205
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,879
not only that but like with all these

1206
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:06,300
[ __ ] land races I get paranoia like a

1207
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,519
[ __ ] and Jesus Christ like

1208
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,560
testing these things is just like a

1209
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:12,420
[ __ ] holding a gun to my head every

1210
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,119
night it's just like

1211
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:17,280
and then I find this thing and now like

1212
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,220
it it [ __ ]

1213
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,380
it kicks me off just right I feel great

1214
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:25,078
every time I'll get like that nice

1215
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,480
daytime Stone like that thing where when

1216
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,818
you're [ __ ] just like

1217
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,500
hanging out you just go into your own

1218
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,460
world for a little while and then

1219
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,579
something you're just like secure

1220
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,880
something and they're like

1221
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:39,960
yeah yeah so we're all good

1222
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,980

1223
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,380
door

1224
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,380
there's like a squirrel outside just

1225
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,119
minding its own business and you're just

1226
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,640
embracing

1227
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,920
nice yeah no I definitely get that and

1228
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,558
I've been telling my guys that too I've

1229
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,318
you know for years I've been the I love

1230
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:59,519
ties I love sativas I'm all about that

1231
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:00,358
stuff

1232
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,358
um

1233
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:05,098
the last few years you know as I'm aging

1234
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,739
and [ __ ] I'm starting to get more into

1235
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:11,579
the into the Downs into the relaxing

1236
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:13,379
ones yeah I think that I think the Sanai

1237
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:15,119
ruined it for me because we found a

1238
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:19,318
really [ __ ] hazy one out of that

1239
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:22,680
Egyptian land race and oh my God it blew

1240
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,358
it Swami uh gas from Swami organic seeds

1241
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:26,338
he actually selected towards that

1242
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:28,679
phenotype but it was one of the last

1243
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:30,838
ones I had had where it makes everything

1244
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:32,519
brighter it makes everything louder the

1245
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:34,980
ground kind of starts doing the wave

1246
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,739
thing and you're just getting along and

1247
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,960
I was like man I just this stuff's not

1248
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:42,959
for me like it was when I was a teenager

1249
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,639
you know yeah I'm not the I'm Not The

1250
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,179
Party Guy anymore I don't need the party

1251
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,179
weed

1252
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,599
some people that have never had it

1253
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,079
before and I was just like everybody's

1254
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,599
crawling out of their skin like

1255
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,940
it's a it's a fun uh it's a fun game to

1256
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,059
go and play but man I cannot do it every

1257
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,980
day anymore so these like these more

1258
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,319
Indigo base are kind of what I'm going

1259
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,500
for anymore right now

1260
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:19,019
hell yeah man I I just thought we need

1261
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:22,639
to probably meet up dumpster Donna with

1262
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:25,559
your dumpster hash plant yeah

1263
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,019
dumpster Donna was one that I found out

1264
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,960
of some salami organic seeds it was a

1265
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:33,960
Packy chocolate tie hybrid across back

1266
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,940
to the chocolate tie and

1267
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,440
I mean they were there was phenotypes

1268
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,079
all over the board but the one that I

1269
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,838
selected for it looked like a Packy

1270
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,660
plant with Thai leaves on it

1271
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:48,960
and it had the Packy yield the Packy bud

1272
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:51,719
structure but the effect was like a

1273
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,059
calmer tie and it was just beautiful but

1274
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,858
it wasn't it wasn't the flavor profile

1275
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:57,599
you'd expect for it when that pack he

1276
00:52:55,858 --> 00:53:00,779
got involved with the chocolate tie it

1277
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,300
just made this funky wet garbage thing

1278
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,460
and every time I explained it to

1279
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,059
somebody they'd be like oh my God you

1280
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,338
like that and I'm like [ __ ] yeah

1281
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:12,359
favorite profiles

1282
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:14,039
[ __ ] like that and if you're saying

1283
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:16,019
you're getting nasty all kinds of stuff

1284
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,779
out of this dumpster hash plant the

1285
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:21,119
curry that sounds really intriguing it

1286
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,920
was the first thing I found with that I

1287
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,880
like odd [ __ ] like that like that's

1288
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,619
that's

1289
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,240
what's special to me that's what's

1290
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,559
unique and that's the kind of stuff that

1291
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,479
I like to smoke

1292
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,040
that's why those lesothos are so [ __ ]

1293
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,679
cool I never [ __ ] smelled anything

1294
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:39,000
like that going Chinese food restaurant

1295
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:41,759
like yeah all day long please and with a

1296
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,400
peanut butter taste like yes like let's

1297
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,400
go are you going into these Chinese

1298
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,660
restaurants dressed like that though

1299
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,480
absolutely

1300
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:54,500
me

1301
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,500
you're a goddamn hero

1302
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,539
Senegal stuff too like you've got

1303
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:04,259
you've got a reason this

1304
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:08,159
an area right here like uh there's like

1305
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:10,740
these [ __ ] burnt Tire like sour

1306
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,899
Skittle things that are all over that

1307
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:15,659
area and it's

1308
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,160
as much as I hate sifting through a

1309
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,719
bunch of

1310
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,879
that

1311
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,139
it's worth it because these some of the

1312
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,900
profiles that come out of it are just

1313
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:27,838
gnarly just like hot rubber sour Skittle

1314
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:31,019
like those Senegalese those things were

1315
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,539
[ __ ] awesome man so that mixed with

1316
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:36,179
like a [ __ ] Packy tie or something

1317
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:39,480
like that that would be a [ __ ]

1318
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:43,259
that'd be a fun combination did you ever

1319
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:46,440
get a chance to touch or smoke or do

1320
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:49,160
anything with the Moroccan

1321
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,159
no

1322
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:52,639
destroyed away

1323
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:56,519
wings

1324
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:59,818
um I have

1325
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:03,239
I have a pack of them I think somewhere

1326
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:05,039
but they might be like a Moroccan Congo

1327
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:07,979
Cross or something like that

1328
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:12,380
okay I don't know I've never grown

1329
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:14,159
Moroccan but I imagine it's probably

1330
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,039
I don't know

1331
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:21,659
I could see it being like

1332
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:23,699
a weird variation on like

1333
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:26,338
what I'm not saying this is the

1334
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:30,179
combination like but it would be like a

1335
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:32,338
mix of like Afghani and like Congolese I

1336
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:34,440
could see Moroccan being like

1337
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:36,179
I don't know there's like certain ways

1338
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,338
you can kind of like

1339
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:40,739
pick out what certain region stuff is

1340
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:43,139
going to be like for some reason and

1341
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:45,479
Africa there's like a lot of like really

1342
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:48,719
similar like bass lines that run through

1343
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,539
these things like veins and then like

1344
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,459
as soon as

1345
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:55,858
like there's just

1346
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,039
like these base flavors that just hang

1347
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:00,779
out and face scent profiles but they

1348
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,699
just develop in different ways in these

1349
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,859
different regions and

1350
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:07,139
I don't know for how much like

1351
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:09,480
hashmaking Morocco does and stuff like

1352
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:11,639
that I could see them going and focusing

1353
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,440
all towards like these hashy varieties

1354
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:15,598
but I don't think flavor is too big of a

1355
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,280
concern because kind of hash especially

1356
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,700
when you're doing that just kind of goes

1357
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,440
into the same like muddled flavor so I

1358
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:25,318
don't think they would Express too hard

1359
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,059
for like flavor profiles but I don't

1360
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:30,420
know I [ __ ] I don't know I never grew

1361
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:32,760
them we had a couple that were uh

1362
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,380
crossed to

1363
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,020
I'm trying to remember what it was back

1364
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,240
then it was some kind of purple strain

1365
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:41,880
um but they came through like a really

1366
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:44,519
really almost like a potpourri type

1367
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,099
thing going on it wasn't bad

1368
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:51,780
I wasn't crazy about the high super

1369
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:54,180
lethargic yeah like

1370
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:56,180
if you would have let blonde hash go bad

1371
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:59,519
you know

1372
00:56:56,179 --> 00:57:01,259
I just aged for like like my uncle had

1373
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,838
this [ __ ] in his closet for like the

1374
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:06,980
last 10 years you know yeah it just

1375
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,980
knocks me out kind of like that

1376
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:12,539
so do you think it was

1377
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:15,598
it pro like term profile

1378
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,940
from the actual Planet itself

1379
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,838
or do you think it was it was a it was

1380
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,000
like

1381
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,759
it was a purple type that I was used to

1382
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,159
smoking and I don't remember okay if

1383
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,280
that would have been like a purple girl

1384
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:31,379
scout cookies or it was from a

1385
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,000
California breeder so that Bay Area you

1386
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,920
know one of those typical like grape

1387
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,920
Apes something like that

1388
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,920
um

1389
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:43,019
he had crossed it into what was then

1390
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:46,379
called uh katama

1391
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:49,139
from katama Morocco and it wasn't until

1392
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,000
like a few years later that I heard it

1393
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:53,578
not called katama that I heard it called

1394
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,500
the the beldier is that right beldia

1395
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:56,460
Moroccan beldia I believe that's what's

1396
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,838
called

1397
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,838
um but I had never heard that name we

1398
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,519
just called it katama and uh so I kind

1399
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:04,739
of knew the purple strain that was in

1400
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:06,719
there so you notice when there's

1401
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:09,299
something different you know brought

1402
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,879
into it so that potpourri type of thing

1403
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,160
it wasn't strictly purple it it

1404
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,619
definitely was influenced somehow by

1405
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:20,039
that Moroccan

1406
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:22,039
interesting that would be a cool

1407
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:25,980
you got me who knows

1408
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:28,199
it's a spicy thing I just [ __ ]

1409
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,000
[ __ ] mind shot into like actually

1410
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:31,919
that that wouldn't make sense you could

1411
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,780
find these cool potpourri things like

1412
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,240
what do I have that I could go and find

1413
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,220
it's like all right now I hadn't had it

1414
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,318
Pier though so I don't know maybe you

1415
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:42,259
know there's a lot of land races just

1416
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:46,880
pure feral stock that can be pretty

1417
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,880
lacklusters though oh dude

1418
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:52,219
yeah exactly

1419
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:55,920
um yeah

1420
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:57,539
exactly yeah like you gotta I don't know

1421
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,059
so like I do I like doing the

1422
00:58:57,539 --> 00:59:03,058
preservation stuff but then going in

1423
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:06,059
doing like a uh

1424
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:07,920
like the this guy that hooked me up with

1425
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:11,640
all these [ __ ] his own preservation

1426
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,980
[ __ ] from the start he uh

1427
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:16,679
he crossed a lot of his [ __ ] with this

1428
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,599
kendalla Kem which is a chemd cross with

1429
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:21,000
I-95

1430
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:24,298
and uh

1431
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,239
it's I've grown out a ton of them of

1432
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:30,179
just like that Senegalese hit with it

1433
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:32,899
the uh I did

1434
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:37,639
that's a beautiful plant man

1435
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,639
every time you say it did

1436
00:59:41,338 --> 00:59:47,279
across with uh kendalla cam like

1437
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:49,199
it added so much [ __ ] resin to it but

1438
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,140
like with the Senegalese it was like

1439
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:55,439
that's crazy it's really [ __ ] long

1440
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:58,379
stocks but really good tackiness you're

1441
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,420
like pretty small not even pretty really

1442
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,099
small [ __ ] resin heads but they're

1443
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,200
like

1444
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:06,480
it's just a different texture than you

1445
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:08,460
see in a lot of different [ __ ] stuff

1446
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,960
that's going around now it's like these

1447
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,699
little [ __ ] pinheads they're just

1448
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,940
like

1449
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:17,759
but uh with the candle look hem it just

1450
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,740
added a million more of those and you

1451
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,559
it's hard to bully those [ __ ] land

1452
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:25,558
races around so like it held pretty

1453
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:28,200
strong to its [ __ ] sativa

1454
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:30,119
like base but

1455
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:33,598
definitely cut the time down it went

1456
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,858
down from like a 12 to 14 down to like

1457
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,838
uh

1458
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:40,019
a solid

1459
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:41,578
11 12. so that was nice

1460
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:44,099
but uh

1461
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:46,019
yeah I like doing the [ __ ] mixing up

1462
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,838
one out Crossing from a feral stock

1463
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:51,000
that's not that bad man yeah who's to

1464
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:53,699
say how feral it is because it's coming

1465
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,539
from a dude who's trait

1466
01:00:53,699 --> 01:01:00,000
like this dude is out in Africa

1467
01:00:57,539 --> 01:01:02,099
he's going and collecting stuff he's

1468
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,380
probably growing his own stuff he's also

1469
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:06,298
has the wherewithal to be able to go and

1470
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,298
use the internet to go and send things

1471
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:13,380
back and forth so he has some interest

1472
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:15,420
so as far as the term feral stock I I

1473
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:18,539
sometimes have a problem with that

1474
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:21,240
because I can't claim that you know like

1475
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:22,500
I can only go as far as I could as far

1476
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:24,419
as I could say

1477
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,818
but it's like uh

1478
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,519
who's to say whoever told me that isn't

1479
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:31,318
lying so I know it came from the where

1480
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,000
they came from and stuff like that as

1481
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:34,980
soon as it gets there that [ __ ] line

1482
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,659
dies so did this guy go out there and

1483
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,880
collect them himself

1484
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:42,000
I don't know did he go from a guy that's

1485
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,380
been growing and selecting for years

1486
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,298
I don't know

1487
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:48,240
and uh

1488
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:51,380
yeah and I feel like that's any more

1489
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:54,719
like the term feral stock

1490
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:57,240
it's it's a hard term to go and run with

1491
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,858
because it's just if they're coming from

1492
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,199
someone they're coming from somewhere

1493
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:04,558
like

1494
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,118
there's not a ton of ferals that people

1495
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,640
are sending on the internet anymore

1496
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,660
there's a lot of people that say they do

1497
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,659
right yeah

1498
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,679
yeah or what was that uh Indian Land

1499
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:18,719
race exchange I mean it's a selection in

1500
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:21,779
a field of plants that have been being

1501
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:25,139
grown over the course of a very long

1502
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:26,640
time for select plants I mean they

1503
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:28,078
collect seeds for the ones they like

1504
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,358
they're not gonna [ __ ]

1505
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:34,700
you know so

1506
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:34,699
there it is the awesome stuff

1507
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:40,920
yeah we uh we got the Indian tour book

1508
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,539
because I didn't have a big collection

1509
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,099
of Indians so I was like oh I'm gonna

1510
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:45,960
get in on this one

1511
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:48,000
first time I've bought seeds in a long

1512
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,500
day which ones did you get from Indian

1513
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,179
Land race

1514
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:57,239
oh we got the the Indian tour book

1515
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:59,699
so it had like a pack from every region

1516
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:02,578
that they went to and collected and uh

1517
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:03,899
it came with a book that had pictures of

1518
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:06,420
the plants that they were selecting

1519
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,160
seeds from and explaining the latitude

1520
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,900
the longitude what they thought of these

1521
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,298
plants the smells and the flavors they

1522
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:16,680
were getting off of it it's pretty cool

1523
01:03:12,298 --> 01:03:19,920
yeah so do you consider that so what in

1524
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:22,858
your heirlooms

1525
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,639
I would say that's heirloom

1526
01:03:22,858 --> 01:03:28,199
when I think of barrel seed I think uh

1527
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:30,659
the seeds that are falling in the field

1528
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:33,118
you know that would be land or feral

1529
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:34,920
land race and then anything grown

1530
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,900
outside of that condition would then be

1531
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,599
considered an heirloom

1532
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,680
yeah what do you think

1533
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,680
I would agree with

1534
01:03:46,338 --> 01:03:51,358
heirloom and all that stuff yeah that's

1535
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:56,099
I mean heirloom is just work Generations

1536
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:58,019
off of one original stock so

1537
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:01,019
yeah you're you're right with all that

1538
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:02,519
man like uh I I just wanna I'm curious

1539
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:03,719
because no I'm double checking I'm not

1540
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:07,259
working from somebody that's been doing

1541
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:09,539
it longer than me yeah yeah no I

1542
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,460
know uh what other people's thoughts are

1543
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:14,159
on these things you know so it's like

1544
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:18,000
what I could consider feral is very

1545
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:20,759
easily different to you so

1546
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,838
yeah no I would I would consider the

1547
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:27,420
same thing but to be fair if it's

1548
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:30,298
I don't know if I would still consider

1549
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:33,420
I consider Pharaoh more so like

1550
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:35,639
seeds falling off of a plant in a wild

1551
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:36,480
situation rather like whether that's

1552
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:38,519
like

1553
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,440
right in the field just falling straight

1554
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:42,298
back on the ground yeah but if it's like

1555
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,400
a feel that you're doing selection on

1556
01:04:42,298 --> 01:04:45,480
and stuff like that and then I don't

1557
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,880
know there's so many different things

1558
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,619
that could come out of it because like

1559
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,298
all these fields are getting retailed

1560
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:53,460
and stuff like that so you are throwing

1561
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:55,739
all these so you have feral seeds that

1562
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:59,760
go and fall I would say that would be a

1563
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:02,159
cultivated land race yeah okay cool yeah

1564
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,780
I don't these are just things that like

1565
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,940
spin off in my head and it's like how

1566
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,798
can this term be

1567
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,420
thought of differently

1568
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:11,699
so

1569
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,579
I don't know it's cool I like these

1570
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:16,618
conversations [ __ ] yeah dude and you're

1571
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:19,740
not only breeding cannabis you're

1572
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:21,180
breeding you did what zinnias all kinds

1573
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:24,298
of different flowers all kinds of

1574
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:27,500
different peppers squashes holy [ __ ] man

1575
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:27,500
where do you find the time

1576
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:43,139
don't have kids yet and there it's uh

1577
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:45,380
you know so save some time with that and

1578
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,379
uh

1579
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:52,740
I don't know man it's it's something I

1580
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:54,000
care a lot about I got a full-time job I

1581
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:57,239
got

1582
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,099
a [ __ ] small farm that we run I help

1583
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:01,318
with

1584
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:03,660
a few other people's things around here

1585
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,599
we grew up in a farming Community still

1586
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:08,578
a farming Community like

1587
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,838
I don't know man it's it's just

1588
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:11,700
something I love so it never really

1589
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,798
feels like work unless I'm at work you

1590
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,179
know so

1591
01:06:13,798 --> 01:06:17,099
I don't know

1592
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:20,039
it takes a lot of time but it's time

1593
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:22,559
that I don't mind losing right now

1594
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,538
we were talking about a lot of the

1595
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,579
different clones that you had

1596
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:28,740
um in your area

1597
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:30,660
and the stuff that was popular around

1598
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:33,779
you and you'd mentioned the Death Star

1599
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,818
obviously uh the dumpster hash plant the

1600
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,880
lemon G there was one that you said that

1601
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:44,239
I had no idea what it was the lithium

1602
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:47,358
ah the eludium q36 exploding reactor

1603
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,358
thank you

1604
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:55,380
that's awesome yeah

1605
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,900
yeah old Marvin the Martian reference uh

1606
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:02,039
from Looney Tunes back in the day the

1607
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:04,139
eludium q36 is a

1608
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:07,200
oh let me

1609
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:09,358
so it is

1610
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:12,078
there's a group that was growing a whole

1611
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:16,078
bunch of really nice

1612
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,480
lavenders Indiana bubble gums Bubbas

1613
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,900
things like that

1614
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,900
also this may be a precursor as to like

1615
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:27,660
why I like linole and [ __ ] so much

1616
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:30,298
but uh

1617
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:31,980
they were going and started making their

1618
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:36,798
own lines and [ __ ] like that and made

1619
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:36,798
this one called the eludium which

1620
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:42,838
actually they might have made one before

1621
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:44,400
that so there's another line that was

1622
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:48,420
called its sister line it's called the

1623
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:50,760
new and it was a Bubba Kush lavender

1624
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:54,480
put back onto

1625
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:58,740
a lavender clone and then there was the

1626
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:02,699
ludium q36 which is the

1627
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:05,699
Bubba Kush lavender put onto a Hawaiian

1628
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:08,879
or Bubba Kush lavender

1629
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:12,480
onto Bubba I think

1630
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:15,900
and then on to Hawaiian indica

1631
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:19,859
and that's what made the alludium

1632
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:21,480
but it's just like a Bubba on steroids

1633
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:25,440
with

1634
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:28,979
just way slower veg like it's miserable

1635
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:30,838
plant to grow like it is a beautiful

1636
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,759
little golf ball

1637
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:38,399
like

1638
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:40,560
resonance as [ __ ] like great smells like

1639
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:44,219
it was

1640
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:47,160
if people had eludium next to like a

1641
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:49,439
[ __ ] bag of cookies no one's picking

1642
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:51,000
cookies like it's

1643
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,798
and it's something that's been around

1644
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,600
for a little while now

1645
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,479
um those dudes

1646
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,219
and I to be honest like that lineage I

1647
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:01,738
know it's the Bubba the lavender and the

1648
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:04,980
Hawaiian Indica if it's back crossed on

1649
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:08,278
the Bubba I don't remember exactly

1650
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:13,619
um those guys disappeared pretty quickly

1651
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:15,239
after uh I first saw it and I just the

1652
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:16,439
only thing that I still see is the

1653
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:19,759
eludium

1654
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:22,919
the nuke was just a

1655
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:25,380
lavender potpourri bomb like just

1656
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,298
beautiful pinky light Violet purple

1657
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,440
[ __ ] buds

1658
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:30,600
um

1659
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:33,659
beautiful [ __ ] weed but yeah dude

1660
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,739
those those two were

1661
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:36,738
chef's kiss

1662
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,179
plus that bubble gum the lavender like

1663
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:45,119
all the [ __ ] those guys were [ __ ]

1664
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:47,579
pumping out was incredible

1665
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,140
and uh yeah we're fortunate though

1666
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:51,298
ludium's still around

1667
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:55,199
I had it

1668
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:57,840
for a while I gotta get it back again

1669
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,759
but we still have like uh Island sweet

1670
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,600
skunk around

1671
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,159
um

1672
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,539
that's been around for a long time

1673
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:06,119
around here

1674
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:09,079
yeah that was popular here too

1675
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:13,099
yeah and vicinity with Canada

1676
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:17,100
yeah it's great yeah a border towns yeah

1677
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:18,660
but uh yeah there's a there's a lot of

1678
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,640
cool [ __ ] that went around for a long

1679
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:23,158
time the g13s that went around here were

1680
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,380
[ __ ] nuts dude there were several of

1681
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:26,759
them there's there's this one with a

1682
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:30,000
variegation

1683
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:33,539
that I've been looking for for a long

1684
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,140
time there's another one that went out

1685
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:39,479
to Colorado and was never seen again

1686
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,820
and uh

1687
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:44,218
me and the guy that took it out to

1688
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:47,880
Colorado are still looking for it it was

1689
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:51,779
a super squatty little [ __ ] like

1690
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:55,079
it almost looked like uh

1691
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:57,960
it wasn't like a pine tree it like it's

1692
01:10:55,079 --> 01:11:00,600
it's side branching would almost like

1693
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,760
Sprague itself it was just like this

1694
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,280
little [ __ ] like hedge that would

1695
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,980
just Stout as [ __ ] and just throw these

1696
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:10,979
[ __ ] potent ass buds but then yeah

1697
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:13,500
dumpster the Woody Hayes

1698
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:16,099
um Woody Hayes yeah

1699
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,100
Woody Hayes

1700
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,140
resistor

1701
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,140
Super Silver

1702
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,100
just

1703
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:28,158
look beautiful

1704
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,159
um

1705
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,600
yeah we I mean there's

1706
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,880
a four-way cut that went around here

1707
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,640
that one was really [ __ ] great just

1708
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,859
like this raunchy [ __ ] like

1709
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,659
burning tire

1710
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:45,539
there's a ton of people that say it was

1711
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:48,259
the same as the Fairfax I don't think so

1712
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:50,460
I think it was a different one there's

1713
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:52,020
tons of people that were popping seeds

1714
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,198
man it doesn't always have to be the

1715
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:57,420
same cut and most likely

1716
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:59,279
and uh yeah I don't know we were

1717
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,039
fortunate where it's like a lot of these

1718
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,899
older lines They still hang out around

1719
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:06,600
the area and

1720
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:08,099
are back and forth you'll see them for a

1721
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,039
little wave and then they disappear

1722
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:13,219
there's this mango Afghan

1723
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,600
uh

1724
01:12:13,219 --> 01:12:18,119
what do we got here girl green daddy

1725
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,280
says does Boogie have any tips or advice

1726
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,859
for growing the more unique land races

1727
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:25,039
in smaller areas not quite limited

1728
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:25,039
though

1729
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:31,319
uh yeah so I personally like going and

1730
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,819
like if it's a new one that I'm just

1731
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:35,880
getting into

1732
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:37,979
have no idea about it aside from the

1733
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,079
assumption that okay because it's from

1734
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:42,419
this area it probably has a

1735
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,579
closer you already equator

1736
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:47,039
the [ __ ] leggier they're gonna get

1737
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:49,140
like then it goes north and south and

1738
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:51,979
then as you go [ __ ] I feel like a

1739
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,980
weatherman right now

1740
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,960
weatherman I've ever seen

1741
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,219
um hey we might listen to this dude

1742
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:06,738
but uh yeah I mean if you're in this

1743
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:06,738
area

1744
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:13,079
so you're just gonna [ __ ] explode

1745
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:15,900
um you can kind so I like to go and kind

1746
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:18,119
of just like navigate what my expected

1747
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:19,799
flowering time if you're getting seeds

1748
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:22,500
from somebody and they could give you a

1749
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,739
really good [ __ ] information about

1750
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,119
like what to expect awesome also buy

1751
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:28,738
seats from people that test their

1752
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:30,719
[ __ ] gear because if they can't tell

1753
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,459
you how to grow it

1754
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,359
[ __ ] them can you say that one more time

1755
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,359
I didn't hear it

1756
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:48,000
for the people in the back yeah [ __ ]

1757
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:50,039
wild that people are just like take my

1758
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,140
money it's just yeah

1759
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:55,519
what I made this

1760
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:59,520
yeah so hey

1761
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,560
I don't have the fortune of knowing

1762
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,600
what these things grow like so I can

1763
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,100
only go off of self-assumption for a lot

1764
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,900
of them like on the map and [ __ ] like oh

1765
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,880
Lesotho pretty South so there could have

1766
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:14,219
the potential of being like some pretty

1767
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,560
[ __ ] like squatty little guys and

1768
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:18,960
stuff but also that [ __ ]

1769
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,460
equatorial thing is still in there so

1770
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,560
it's just like it has the potential to

1771
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:24,420
blow up so

1772
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,760
south of the equator is a little

1773
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:31,520
different than North but also India

1774
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,520
weird thing just read please

1775
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,520
do do your due diligence when you're

1776
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:38,460
going and popping seeds if you want to

1777
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,620
like fully understand what's going on

1778
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:42,719
ask as many questions as possible okay

1779
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:44,760
let me expand on it because I have a

1780
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,439
question for you personally

1781
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,860
um with

1782
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:52,339
have you've done a few equatorials right

1783
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:54,960
oh yeah

1784
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:57,600
What flowering time are you using with

1785
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:01,980
them usually and uh how quick are you

1786
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:05,460
flowering okay so most the time if I'm

1787
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:08,639
doing a test run of them in a isolated

1788
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,980
room they'll go on to like a ten and a

1789
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,440
half hour light

1790
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:15,419
oh nothing too crazy light on 10 and a

1791
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:18,779
half hours

1792
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:20,279
and I don't want to go too crazy with it

1793
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:22,079
and just like go and cut up because you

1794
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:24,300
could speed the [ __ ] up but like 10 and

1795
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:26,760
a half hours kind of sits pretty still

1796
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:29,579
with them I'll I'll go and Sprout them

1797
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,739
veg them for about two weeks and then

1798
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:34,260
throw out I'm just looking for like

1799
01:15:31,738 --> 01:15:37,259
basically what the expected stretch is

1800
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:39,960
and then understanding what the Baseline

1801
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:43,199
terpene profile is so I'll grow them in

1802
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:45,300
something like uh one gallon pot go and

1803
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:48,779
put

1804
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:50,760
10 to 20 of them together that just go

1805
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:53,099
and flower them real close together

1806
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,260
uh

1807
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:57,780
yeah I mean

1808
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:59,820
a lot of the stuff that I do

1809
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:02,340
I just kind of stress test a lot of

1810
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:04,439
things see how it goes if it does really

1811
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:06,779
well in one area I'm gonna go and

1812
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:07,859
probably continue it like if it's grown

1813
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:10,439
in

1814
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:12,359
a stress-induced environment like these

1815
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:14,279
small pots for these equatorial sativas

1816
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:16,439
and [ __ ] like that you're gonna very

1817
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:18,059
quickly see your [ __ ] Herm

1818
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:20,339
Expressions you're gonna go and very

1819
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:22,020
quickly see how fast things go and try

1820
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,100
to reach up to the light ahead of other

1821
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,800
things

1822
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:28,260
you're going to see a base glance as to

1823
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,300
what you're going and and this is like

1824
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,579
I'm not saying you got to have some

1825
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,960
seeds to go and do this like this isn't

1826
01:16:32,579 --> 01:16:35,399
something like you have a 10 pack and

1827
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,500
you want to do a preservation if that's

1828
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:40,859
the case [ __ ] open pollinate that

1829
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:43,079
[ __ ] and do that really nicely but for

1830
01:16:40,859 --> 01:16:45,000
like testing these like equatorial

1831
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:48,079
things and just getting a base reference

1832
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,079
is see how these are

1833
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:51,779
I like kind of stress and them see what

1834
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,940
they do and then

1835
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:55,859
if it's something that we can work with

1836
01:16:53,939 --> 01:16:58,678
and there's some nice smells that come

1837
01:16:55,859 --> 01:17:00,359
off of it let's continue with it but if

1838
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:03,960
not like

1839
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:07,698
I have the seeds then at least but

1840
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,698
probably not going to continue with it

1841
01:17:08,939 --> 01:17:13,979
hell yeah man tons of good information

1842
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:16,800
there uh that's pretty much what I'm

1843
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:20,698
doing as well I do one gallon pots

1844
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,440
um I do 12 or 12 12 from seed i flour

1845
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:25,619
them right away from seed uh but I've

1846
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:28,319
been using 11 13 that more Hawaiian type

1847
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:30,300
deal but ten and a half that's cool you

1848
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,639
bringing it down your

1849
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,739
you know you're not going for yield when

1850
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,780
you're looking through land races for

1851
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:38,639
the first time oh no

1852
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:40,319
means so everything's just get it done

1853
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,119
fast and that's cool that you brought

1854
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:45,139
down to 10 and a half I don't think I

1855
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:48,179
you know I going from

1856
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:51,239
hybrids and starting with uh some some

1857
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:54,179
of those uh doing 12 12 on practically

1858
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:56,519
everything and then realizing not all

1859
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:58,619
land races were like that you know you

1860
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:01,440
had to bring down that light quite a bit

1861
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:04,260
so uh I went to the 11 13 I haven't

1862
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:09,238
grown anything outside of that yet

1863
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:13,500
I like the 11 13 for everything else

1864
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:15,178
um even my like just regular lines I do

1865
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,960
and [ __ ] like it's

1866
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:21,840
I like the 11 13. I think them having a

1867
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,819
little longer sleep is nice

1868
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,460
I think a lot takes off in the night in

1869
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:28,619
the dark and uh

1870
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,760
yeah I just I just really love that

1871
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:31,859
light cycle

1872
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,260
seems that like during winter too you

1873
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:36,960
get like really nice colors coming out

1874
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:39,659
when you go and do that 11 13. the 10

1875
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,698
and a half I

1876
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:44,279
honestly I was doing

1877
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:48,238
a lot of things just 12 12 for a long

1878
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:51,000
time I got into doing 11 and a half for

1879
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,319
yeah 11 for a long time just because I

1880
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,760
was doing everything together just

1881
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:54,960
testing and because it's sativas

1882
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,179
together

1883
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:00,480
and then uh

1884
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:03,119
over the course of time I just [ __ ]

1885
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,738
graduated into doing this land race

1886
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,819
thing they just seem to respond better

1887
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:07,819
and they have like

1888
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:13,439
a better flower cluster sometimes I it

1889
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:15,059
doesn't make sense to me but it's just

1890
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:18,719
like things that have happened for me

1891
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:21,360
using that it they just seem to kind of

1892
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,460
build a little squatter in comparison

1893
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:25,319
but granted that's like a clone off the

1894
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,840
mother so I can't really use that as a

1895
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:29,698
solid reference so your your clone's

1896
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,980
always going to be like if you have a

1897
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:34,319
seed mother and go and take a [ __ ]

1898
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:36,299
clone off of that seed mother your clone

1899
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,319
is always going to be slightly different

1900
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:43,039
than the seed mother so I can't really

1901
01:19:39,319 --> 01:19:43,039
contribute that

1902
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:48,899
to The Strain itself or whatever but

1903
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:50,639
I don't know you just got to play around

1904
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:54,000
with it test things

1905
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,679
experiment see what works

1906
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,158
that one works for me

1907
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:02,219
good voice man all good information I

1908
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:04,079
uh really really appreciate all that man

1909
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:06,119
[ __ ] I'm learning a little bit here too

1910
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:09,600
I like that

1911
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:11,340
um can I ask why you said that you use

1912
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,000
the seed mother

1913
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,980
um

1914
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,979
is DNA not DNA

1915
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,020
so I think there is a significant

1916
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:24,000
difference when you go and take a

1917
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:26,460
plant's Tap Root away

1918
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,319
yeah and I just don't think you're able

1919
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,779
to have the same metabolism and then

1920
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:33,359
your plant itself is just going to go

1921
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:35,099
and result in a [ __ ]

1922
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:37,079
because it has a different nutrient

1923
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,179
uptake system it has a different

1924
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,500
expression that's tied to that and

1925
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:42,359
that's all I don't think there's

1926
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,100
anything it's still the same thing

1927
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:47,158
you'll still have the same profiles and

1928
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:50,219
stuff I've just noticed a change in the

1929
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:52,379
way the actual like bud structure looks

1930
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:55,380
to a point and granted that could be

1931
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,480
also environmental but I probably a

1932
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:59,219
little bit easier to take care of over a

1933
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:01,979
long period of time

1934
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:04,619
yeah and I love seed mothers and [ __ ]

1935
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:06,899
but they gotta go eventually

1936
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:10,158
and uh

1937
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:10,158
I don't know it's a

1938
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:14,159
it's just my experience and once again

1939
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:17,279
like everything that I'm saying this is

1940
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:20,879
just my experience I I implore everybody

1941
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:22,619
to please go out and if you're wanting

1942
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,539

01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:58,379
it's not hard anymore like just go buy a

1981
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,899
pack you find some cool [ __ ] like

1982
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:03,319
get into it it's much harder to clean up

1983
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:06,539
a gene pool than it is to muddy it up

1984
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:08,698
yeah you want to have fun like if you

1985

01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:14,460
grow peppers it's the easiest [ __ ]

1987
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:16,920
thing it is such a simple step like you

1988
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:21,179
have a very simple understanding as to

1989
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:23,399
like oh male flower goes on the stamen

1990
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:26,760
pie

1991
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:28,799
you pollinate it right there like you

1992
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:31,800
get to see the actual fruit development

1993
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,659
you get to see the seeds see how they

1994
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,179
develop you grow the seeds out you see

1995
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:38,339
how the generation looks if it's like

1996
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:39,960
two different varieties if you're just

1997
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:41,520
self-pollinating the pepper you're not

1998
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,500
really I mean

1999
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,679
it's cool but like you're not making

2000
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:48,658
anything you're just continuing but uh

2001
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:51,119
yeah dude just if you want to learn

2002
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:53,460
about pot and

2003
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,899
plant numbers are something that weird

2004
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:57,359
you out and

2005
01:23:54,899 --> 01:24:01,859

01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:02,639
wild uh it's crazy

2007
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:05,279
um

2008
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:07,199
just grow [ __ ] vegetables man you can

2009
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,658
teach yourself everything you need to

2010
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:12,359
know it opens up your mind it goes and

2011
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:15,599
teaches you new ways of doing things new

2012
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:19,198
ways of looking at things it's

2013
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,000
it's the closest you can get to having

2014
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:22,799
a

2015
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,319
thousand [ __ ] pot plants is by having

2016
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:28,380
a thousand pepper plants and just teach

2017
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:30,599

01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:41,460
another one of these if you're down for

2022
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,840
one in the future Boogie yes I had it I

2023
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:45,980
had a great time and I learned so much

2024
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,980
from you on this [ __ ] episode

2025
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,840
super fun

2026
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:57,719
that was pretty cool happy I was you

2027
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,158
first yeah I look like [ __ ]

2028
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,880
Lieutenant Dan

2029
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:03,259
um

2030
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:07,020
up uh

2031
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:10,079
it's awesome though and it says but it

2032
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:12,600
speaks Boogie chunks it says

2033
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,219
um I really wanted to get into a lot

2034
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,539
more stuff with you and that's what I'm

2035
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:18,239
saying we need to get you on again

2036
01:25:15,539 --> 01:25:20,939
because you also pair terpenes with food

2037
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,259
and I feel like that could be an episode

2038
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:24,599
in itself

2039
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,100
so uh definitely looking forward to

2040
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:28,679
seeing some of the stuff that you've

2041
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:32,520
done up there uh people can find you on

2042
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:36,899
Instagram at Boogie chunks where else

2043
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:41,400
that's it that's it yeah I'm not a huge

2044
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:44,039
Tech Guy like uh it's cool but uh yeah

2045
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:46,079
it's a toxic Place sometimes man hell

2046
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:48,000
yeah but uh that's why we made our

2047
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:50,460
little Community there so maybe uh go

2048
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,039

2049
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:57,179
Boogie chunks one of these times yeah

2050

2053
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:07,980
um and yeah I would love this car like

2054
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:10,559
this if you guys want I could just start

2055
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:13,500
sending like stuff out like

2056
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,080
regularly I

2057
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,760
so lots of giveaways I'm not really

2058
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:19,738
asking for anything or we could set up

2059
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,199
stuff for a charity that would be

2060
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:24,299
[ __ ] tight and like go and have it go

2061
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:26,759
towards the foundation

2062
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:30,679
um that would be ultimately the cool

2063
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:33,060
thing uh so any of that that's awesome

2064
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:35,279
so we could try to like set up something

2065
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:39,000
where like once a month I just send the

2066
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:40,439
uh a bundle and uh we could just go and

2067
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,100
set it up for like a charity or

2068
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:44,460
something

2069
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:47,280
just sad [ __ ] generous as hell man I

2070
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:49,619

2071
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:52,139
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude thank you

2072
01:26:49,619 --> 01:26:54,000
man that was good before you said that I

2073
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:56,760
was gonna say you sent me all these

2074
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,219
seeds and you know yeah your big

2075
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:01,320
problems as a grower is we keep way more

2076
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:03,600
than we could ever [ __ ] grow

2077
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:05,819
so I was going to give out a couple

2078
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,460
packs we have a game Day Giveaway

2079
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:09,960
tomorrow uh we have a game show that we

2080
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,880
play over there

2081
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,158
um on the same program

2082
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,840
called do or dab maybe you've heard of

2083
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:18,000
it

2084
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,920
but we have two guys that go head to

2085
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,319
head and it's basically like Truth or

2086
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,619
Dare but everything's a dare

2087
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:27,299
sometimes the Dare is doing a dab and if

2088
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:29,579
you don't do the dare you have to take a

2089
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,730
dab so sometimes it's just taking a dab

2090
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:33,359
or doing a dab

2091
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:35,039
[Laughter]

2092
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,439
it

2093
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,600
it's an hour of heavy smoking you know

2094
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,039
just breaking the [ __ ] stigma you

2095
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,900
know you're not gonna overdose on

2096
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:45,119
cannabis we're just gonna leave having a

2097
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:47,579
good time and the prize that we usually

2098
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:48,899
give away is like seeds from one of our

2099
01:27:47,579 --> 01:27:51,300
guests or something like that so I was

2100
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:52,920
gonna pick a few packs out of that uh so

2101
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:55,079
you guys will be able to get some seeds

2102
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,000
