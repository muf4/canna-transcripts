25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
familiar with red scar Seed Company uh

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,798
what you're about and what you're trying

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,640
to achieve with your company yeah um you

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:28,479
know I'm just a small dude um organic

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,759
grower uh like a lot of dudes you know I

30
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,759
do a lot I have a lot of uh use a lot of

31
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,799
Korean natural farming inputs uh I don't

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,399
stand on my soap box and preach about it

33
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,720
a lot but um it's just kind of the way

34
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,280
I've been doing things for a lot of

35
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,599
years you know probably the last decade

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,960
or

37
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,959
so um yeah so I I kind of started off

38
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,879
just to preserve um and to create seeds

39
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,879
for myself and my friends uh it never

40
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:58,599
really was supposed to be a business um

41
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,118
initially it was just um making seeds

42
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,359
because we didn't have access to the

43
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,438
seeds and that that's pretty much how I

44
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:09,959
started off and uh just kind of Grew

45
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:11,759
From there um organically so to speak um

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,598
some years past you know I was kind of

47
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,878
in and out uh of the scene for a while

48
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,959
um being from Kentucky we didn't when I

49
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,919
started growing you know there was

50
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,598
circle of Growers didn't exist there

51
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,000
were no other people that I knew that

52
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,919
cultivated I didn't know uh really any

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,519
other grower in the state besides at the

54
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,719
time I think um I don't want to call him

55
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,719
out he's he's a Senator Senator now in

56
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,400
the state of Kentucky Dan [ __ ] who is

57
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:41,158
running uh do we have to noral no you

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,519
don't have to believe that you know he's

59
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,399
he's good uh he I'll just say he knew

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
some people uh up in the Louisville area

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,680
but for me and my buddies we didn't know

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,598
anybody so I was pretty much kind of on

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
an island by myself so getting seeds was

64
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:55,878
hard it took a long time you didn't know

65
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,799
if they were going to show or not back

66
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:01,399
then so it just the natural thing to do

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
is just create your own seeds and and go

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,519
from there

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,479
um some of those first types that you

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,640
started

71
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:14,719
preserving let's see you know it's just

72
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,679
I'm gonna be real bag seed we would um

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,158
if I'm going to go way back it was like

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,680
the we would collect the best back seed

75
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,439
you know all all off season and then in

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,319
the springtime we would just randomly

77
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,000
pop everything we had and there were

78
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:31,238
times that we found things that were

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,158
just absolutely abolutely remarkable

80
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,719
grew with the resin of the old school

81
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:39,798
White Widow but just absolutely rre of

82
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,560
garlic um way back before anybody had

83
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,080
garlic butt or anything like that and

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,158
these things I suppose were just mashups

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,480
of who knows heirlooms from Mexico maybe

86
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,919
some California genetics tossed in of a

87
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,840
true grab

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,639
bag exactly any brick if it was light

89
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,920
green you better believe we were keeping

90
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,318
seeds out of it that was the the

91
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,359
criteria back then is it light green if

92
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,759
so the seeds are probably worth keeping

93
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,599
yeah did it smell of anything other than

94
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,039
mold if so then we might have kept it

95
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:14,000
and grown it you know oh yeah man so how

96
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,759
did you originally get into cannabis

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,759
what was your first

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,519
experience uh just smoking with buddies

99
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,040
um then I I guess uh few years past you

100
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:29,319
know started smoking in high school

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,360
nothing serious just you know smoking on

102
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:37,478
a oion then um I saw my first plants I

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,080
guess like up close when I was about 17

104
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,478
and that kind of stuck with me a little

105
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,399
bit uh it's a little bit older than most

106
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:47,399
people but again coming from

107
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:50,198
Kentucky um it's like to see anybody's

108
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,679
plants at all was pretty pretty

109
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,360
miraculous so um an old buddy Roger

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,360
cotton rest in peace this old dude would

111
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,280
grow 10- foot plants back behind his

112
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,199
trailer in Kentucky

113
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,879
and um his sons would always take me

114
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,639
back there and be like hey man check

115
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,600
these out and we'd go sniff these plants

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,079
and it was just like that's when I knew

117
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,479
that's what I wanted you know I needed

118
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,599
more of that in my life um and I wanted

119
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:20,318
to explore the Aromas and the Aesthetics

120
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,800
were just too much to pass up so um from

121
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,720
that point on I think I started trying

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,038
to find we found a some old magazines of

123
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,759
his and there were all these old Afghan

124
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,318
pictures and [ __ ] like that and so

125
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,038
that's kind of when I initially fell in

126
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,479
love with the Afghans is is seeing those

127
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:39,279
old fat wide leaves on the Christmas

128
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,199
tree shaped plants and big chunky buds

129
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,519
that that's really what got you know

130
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,520
drew me in then a few years later um I

131
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,599
lost my financial aid and scholarships

132
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,439
for a half a gram of weed so from that

133
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,319
point on I was like well they took away

134
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,639
my education I can't get a bik it's too

135
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,280
expensive for me to go to school now

136
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,960
because I have nothing so I'm I'm going

137
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,959
to grow and that around 2002 is when I

138
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,918
decided I'm going to grow and that's

139
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,279
what you know that's the direction I

140
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,079
went in at all at all cost I was going

141
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,758
to

142
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,639
grow between the time when you first

143
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,680
started growing cannabis uh to breeding

144
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,439
it what was the change what made you

145
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
decide that you wanted to breed and how

146
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,598
long did it take after you saw your saw

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,759
your first plants come out of the ground

148
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,439
till you were like I'm going to start

149
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,280
making some of these myself it was a few

150
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:38,120
years you know we made some mistakes

151
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:41,559
along the way um trusting people was

152
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,319
number one I got robbed a few times by

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,120
roommates or friend of a friend you know

154
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,439
you slip up and tell you know your best

155
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,160
buddy he tells his friend all of a

156
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,319
sudden those guys don't like you so much

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,960
they come take your [ __ ] things like

158
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,520
that um I guess for me sometime around

159
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,878
like 07 I started messing around with

160
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,318
like some reefer man genetics uh gypsy's

161
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,439
kiss and and things like that Big

162
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,639
Thunder I think was one of them and um

163
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,598
petrolea a lot of petrolea head stash

164
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,400
crosses and um I guess losing those

165
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:19,000
plants and then looking back six months

166
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,839
later and being like oh I wish we had

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,240
you know some of those Gypsy kiss seeds

168
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,918
but we have none that's when it clicked

169
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
like you've got to preserve this [ __ ]

170
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,560
you have to start creating and you know

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,360
you're going to lose your favorite play

172
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,720
forever if you don't yeah

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,960
absolutely so what was the first plant

174
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,479
that you worked

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,519
with um it was the big it was a big

176
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,158
Thunder plant it was the M Madusa

177
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:48,240
[ __ ] cross um and that was one of

178
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,399
the first ones it was some random pollen

179
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,918
off a mail that I didn't know what it

180
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,918
was and I think I ended up with about 15

181
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,439
ripe seeds and that's about it um but

182
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,839
from that I took those with me down to

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,038
Tennessee and and ran a bunch of them

184
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,198
ran 15 and then ran those for a while

185
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,399
and then made some more off of that and

186
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,478
then took a took a small break and went

187
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:12,959
out west for a while and um tried naive

188
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:14,839
I was naive and thought I could just

189
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,158
like oh I'm gonna go out west I'm gonna

190
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,878
get a job on some mountain and that's

191
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:23,000
gonna be it and um that's the dream yeah

192
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,400
that's the dream and it's just that most

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,120
of the time it's just a dream so when I

194
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,959
came back I came back with the wealth of

195
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,360
knowledge and um new genetics

196
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,319
and and that's kind of when I just stuck

197
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,038
with it and kept making seeds and

198
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,839
breeding hell yeah I know the one that

199
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,240
I've seen you work probably the most on

200
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,719
I don't know if this is the one that

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,959
you've worked the most on but I've seen

202
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,680
you do a lot of work uh with that GMO

203
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:54,239
fuel even be even have problems with

204
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:57,439
other people using the GMO

205
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,320
F yeah she's she's popular uh with with

206
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,360
the boys in the yard um

207
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,278
it's nice um I liked the GMO I didn't

208
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,440
like how it extracted I thought that the

209
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:11,679
turps didn't really carry over in the

210
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,560
flavor um that a lot of times it might

211
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:18,359
smell really rancid like garlic or onion

212
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:21,119
and just skunk ass or death but then

213
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,879
this the flavor is going to come across

214
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,200
as I don't know sometimes it depending

215
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,559
on how late you took GMO it would the

216
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,959
extracts would almost come out like an

217
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:34,919
attic or Grandma's perfume and no matter

218
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,000
what extractor I got it from that seemed

219
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:42,559
to be the like like I don't want I don't

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,240
want that on my mouth so me being the OG

221
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,639
head I'm like well let's smack it with

222
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,039
with a nice OG and at the time I had a

223
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,600
really nice Rocket Fuel mail from

224
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:57,639
archive and always been a big fan of

225
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,440
their gear um politics aside or you know

226
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,240
can can of poit TI aside I've been you

227
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,600
know always been a fan of their gear and

228
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,079
always found good stuff so I just

229
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,600
smacked them up and the first the f1s

230
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,359
came out terrible I couldn't release

231
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,360
them the seeds were mainly pale and

232
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,680
immature um a lot of them cracked I

233
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,440
would say 95% fail rate on that first

234
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:24,519
project um so I didn't release a single

235
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
pack of the

236
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,639
f1s and then made then grew those out

237
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,200
and made some f2s

238
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,720
and it was growing those out that I

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,560
realized this is really special and so I

240
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,519
released a small amount of the f2s and

241
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:42,359
that's kind of when it took off okay so

242
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:46,320
was it just a uh a low bearing seed

243
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,680
plant no um it it produced a lot of

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
seeds um and I still have this problem

245
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,399
even with the

246
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,399
F6 um it's just a really finicky seed

247
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,679
producer it reminds me of some like ogs

248
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,799
that just don't really produce a ton of

249
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,759
viable seeds it have produced thousands

250
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,240
of white immature seeds and maybe a

251
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,519
couple couple hundred or so like really

252
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,879
mature

253
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,839
seeds and I've seen a few strains kind

254
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,320
of do that throughout the years and I me

255
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,959
being a perfectionist I'm like well my

256
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,120
room is [ __ ] right now it's not dialed

257
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:24,119
in like it should be I Mish hit the

258
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,320
timing but then I've got another strain

259
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,600
that's just crushing it you know

260
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
producing these big black vible seeds

261
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,040
with the tiger

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,480
stripes so you know some genetics just

263
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,919
don't you know want to produce seeds for

264
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,759
you like others and that's just the way

265
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,039
it

266
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:45,799
goes right and you actually I told you

267
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,838
earlier we got uh those packs from you

268
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,359
uh so Red Scare seed company has donated

269
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,959
three packs of seeds uh to our patreon

270
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,360
members here a GMO fuel F6 like he was

271
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,199
just talking about uh I've heard you

272
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,839
work with this one quite a bit too and

273
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,320
it's been interesting I want to know

274
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,279
more about is the luden's cough drop

275
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,680
F2 let's touch on that for a sec and

276
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:12,480
then he sent a pack of curvature uh 2.0

277
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,958
we want to hear about both those as well

278
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,759
that luden's cough drop uh is this like

279
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:21,559
a cherry like the classic it is

280
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,639
everybody knows that or what yeah so

281
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,039
back in Michigan I had a pack of cherry

282
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,600
Tahoe from

283
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,879
inhouse um and I'm never really ran a

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,800
bunch of In-House stuff a lot of their

285
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,198
profiles don't really suit my needs you

286
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,479
know the slur cane and all of that but

287
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,159
the Cherry Taho was one of their earlier

288
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,480
packes I

289
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,519
presume um so I popped it and the it was

290
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,440
amazing the Taho really came out with

291
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:53,078
some like bright uh Cherry

292
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,240
undertones uh sweet almond cherry with

293
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:58,359
just that earthy forest

294
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,600
floor and the resin stocks on it were

295
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,039
amazing it was just so coat it just

296
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,720
dumped with sugar you know so you guys

297
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,559
hearing this yeah so I had to take um at

298
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,079
the time I was running a bunch of coffee

299
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:17,399
F3 from uh Pacific Northwest roots and

300
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,759
picked the the what I thought was the

301
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,879
nicest representation of that out of

302
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:26,559
like 20 or 30 seeds I forget how however

303
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:29,278
many I kept um and then yeah and then

304
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,799
cross those up and I I kind set him on

305
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,159
the back burner for a long time and

306
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,439
never really messed with them they just

307
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,240
kind of sat there for a few years um and

308
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,160
that happens a lot as a breeder you kind

309
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,919
of you work a bunch of stuff and some

310
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,919
things you don't get to right away well

311
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,360
I handed them off to my buddy uh city of

312
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,679
homes horiculture up in uh Massachusetts

313
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,000
and about a year later he hits me up

314
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,799
with some pcks and he's like hey I

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,559
finally pop these I'm like oh [ __ ] you

316
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,120
know good luck man and as the pick start

317
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,559
coming in I'm like oh this is this is

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,519
incredible I got to work with this and

319
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:08,439
then he sends me um some samples

320
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,519
and that's when I was like this is it

321
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,199
medicinal uh effects were on point Aroma

322
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,600
flavor everything was just really on

323
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:21,000
point um that

324
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,959
earthy it's like the coffee intertwined

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,198
with the uh Sweet Cherry and forest

326
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,399

pretty hardcore flat earthers um so it's

405
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:55,759
mle breath across to GMO fuel F3 so the

406
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,159
2.0 is pugs breath F2 which is

407

technically AO breath F3 I believe

408
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,640

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,679
Indian Land race exchange drop uh I

455
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,520

456
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,480
a little hazy they've had some fire

457

the ones that I wanted was their black

460
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,519
tiger but then again it's like money

461
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,480
versus how many seeds I have you know

462
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,879
I'm already at the point where it's I

463
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,919
can't grow all these I have to give them

464
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,840
away and I do all the time or we do

465
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,320
auctions cating my number of years left

466
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,798
to strains to grow you know it's like

right I'm sure you you're really OG and

468
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,119

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,120
in a while it's like I need a break I

470
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,918

00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,879
the scheme of things it's not it's not

488
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,399
the worst people get you know kind of uh

489
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,440
emphatic

490
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,080
about uh preserving things and and then

491
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,519
you get into your purist and they're

492
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:28,480
like you know [ __ ] all the hype hybrids

493
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:30,200
you know but I I like them all guy

494
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,120
there's there's I used to be that guy I

495
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,440
used to be that guy hardcore and and now

496
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,239
it's like no there's room for everything

497
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,200
there's room for everybody abely

498
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,480
something I've realized as I got older

499
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,919
even if it's a a type that bag appeal is

500
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,319
off the chain resin producing is off the

501
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,679
chain but it doesn't have a lot of

502
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:54,399
flavor it's not that strong you can take

503
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,559
plants like that and mix the traits in

504
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,480
that you're looking for uh if you do

505
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,839
enough work you know try right with a

506
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,319
few different things that you like that

507
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:06,639
are heavy resin producers great highs um

508
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:09,319
and work it in see what you find exactly

509
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,480
and on the adverse of that you can take

510
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:14,759
something that um like isn't a heavy

511
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,000
resin producer and then cross it with

512
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,038
something that is and then like for

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,720
example the Maru fored we were talking

514
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,480
about the you know the preservation and

515
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,000
whatnot so so that's another uh

516
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,159
Pakistani

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,919
selection um and that asbach region and

518
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,080
one thing that they all carried was this

519
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,000
rotten flesh Aroma a lot of them had

520
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:44,439
this nasty foot

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,278
odor um moldy cheese dead body

522
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,200
smell then when you cross them with

523
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:54,480
something I ended up

524
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,319
multi yeah dead body corpse yeah yeah

525
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,240
and we've found this in a few times

526
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,278
swamp boys had layer cake c and a lot of

527
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,200
the layer cake fenos that people choose

528
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:07,640
are kind of cakey layer cake we found a

529
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,000
corpse feno and then we crossed that

530
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,960
with our GMO fuel F3 back in the day and

531
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,640
that was crude cake that [ __ ] was like

532
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,840
digging up a corpse it was nasty not

533
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,278
that I know what that smells like that's

534
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,399
some weird [ __ ] it's what I would

535
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:23,400
imagine it smells

536
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:32,599
like so oh my God back to the red

537
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:35,599
back to the red Maru no matter how gassy

538
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:38,798
or nasty The Strain you hit to that

539
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:42,480
marof is it turns it

540
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:45,000
tropical it's goes directly 180 away

541
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,480
from the dead corpse and all of a sudden

542
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,599
you're talking guava passion fruit

543
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,038
pineapple like star fruit the most

544
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,558
tropical [ __ ] you can think of all of a

545
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,798
sudden that's that's all you're getting

546
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,639
anymore more it's it's

547
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:05,400
Wild Desert Island

548
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,400
question if you could only take one

549
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,080
strain with you out of anything that

550
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,919
you've made that other people have made

551
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,918
what would you take with

552
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:22,679
you man I'm I'm gonna go with the GMO

553
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:26,879
fuel you know yeah I think I think a Zod

554
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:29,880
cashmere would be a close second so if I

555
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,399
could take two that be my two I haven't

556
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,399
crossed those yet either I don't know

557
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:36,918
why I haven't done that yet timing is OG

558
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,639
lover it's it's surprising you to hear

559
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,240
you say

560
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,200
cashmere it's only because maybe it's my

561
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,960
selections that I was lucky enough to

562
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,880
find but we we um I got mine from bear

563
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,919
frog and I think that's the same person

564
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,600
that bod got his from and a few others I

565
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,320
think he gave them to three or four

566
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,519
people um and shout out to bef frog you

567
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:03,480
know that was an amazing gift

568
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:06,359
we got rid of every feno that smelled

569
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,399
like candy or Jack wiped it out we

570
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,199
didn't want that um we found fenos that

571
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:17,398
smelled like grilled

572
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:21,399
chicken um and had that like salty

573
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:24,599
grilled chicken burnt uh

574
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:29,000
Aromas and the flavor was woodsy and

575
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:31,278
earthy like an OG it it's like um

576
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,599
finding an heirloom peanut butter breath

577
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:37,558
or something it's just like smaller buds

578
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:41,119
that are just caked and resin and the

579
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:44,319
most unique Tarpin you could think of uh

580
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,879
so that's that's it double serrated

581
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,278
leaves real sharp saw blades just

582
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,000
beautiful plants I heard you say salty I

583
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,919
didn't hear you say chicken chicken

584
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,679
saying it reminds you of chicken yes and

585
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,840
multiple people have found this and

586
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,320
worked with it yeah it's the chicken cut

587
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,639
um we selected we selected three of them

588
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,119
that had different variations of grilled

589
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,000
chicken

590
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:14,439
smells and pass them and on the f3s and

591
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,599
on they they've seemed to carry that

592
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,360
that same trait as a as a dominant

593
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,199
trait unbelievable to me this is

594
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,079
mindblowing right now we do another

595
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,919
podcast called the Washington weed

596
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,038
review and they had like the new style

597
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,080
of moon rocks uh that was like a bud

598
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,480
rolled in

599
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:37,720
thca as opposed to like how we used to

600
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,079
make them and it was called chicken and

601
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,519
waffles and when I passed it to my wife

602
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:46,119
she hit it first and she goes it tastes

603
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,639
like chicken I said there's no [ __ ]

604
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:51,359
way you're going to tell me that but

605
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,559
tastes like chicken and it didn't to me

606
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,079
but if you're if you're dead set that

607
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,599
this thing tastes like chicken I got to

608
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:01,000
try that one out too now the flavor the

609
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:04,678
the flavor comes across more of like

610
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,319
uh Earth truffle you know it's really

611
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,679
earthy and buttery but the aroma is

612
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,519
chicken all

613
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,440
day Dad Inky grower says what strain is

614
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,440
on the top for your head stash this

615
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:24,278
season that's that's tough that's tough

616
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:28,240
um really looking forward to this

617
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:31,200
wedding fuel I've I've got going um

618
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,919
and then a banana OG back cross is just

619
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,080
really standing out in the greenhouse

620
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,200
I'll have to post it up uh later on it's

621
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,960
just it was a replacement plant I had a

622
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,360
plant on the back end of my greenhouse

623
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,120
and left the door open uh you know to

624
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,319
vent things out deer walks in about

625
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,398
twice a year and most of the time he

626
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,879
just eats my kale and I'm cool with that

627
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:53,479
this time of year he comes in and wipes

628
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,278
my plan out and just leaves It On The

629
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,839
Ground like thanks fellas so I put this

630
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:00,480
banana OG back there there um just as a

631
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,000
replacement it was kind of spinley at

632
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,240
the time I was like [ __ ] I hate putting

633
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,079
Replacements out you know um it beefed

634
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:13,399
up fast and it's it's it's nice so I'm

635
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm really looking forward to it mus

636
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:16,639
thing that we've been chasing is like

637
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,120
the banana

638
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,919
turp I believe the one that I tried was

639
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:29,079
a was flow from a cut of the banana OG

640
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:31,880
from uh Oregon kid mhm think it was is

641
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,639
that the same one that you worked with I

642
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,440
believe so and I didn't get a lot of

643
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,919
banana per se okay I was gonna say

644
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,120
that's the same with me I didn't get a

645
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,799
lot of banana out of that but have you

646
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:47,199
created something with that that you

647
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:50,759
find to be very banana yeah um we

648
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,038
crossed it to Hannibal OG from Dr

649
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,640
candyman's Candyland seeds I think he's

650
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,000
just Dr Candyman now or Candyman seeds I

651
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,600
think he came back so that's cool

652
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,038
um at the time he was retired I think

653
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,519
like around 2015 he had made a release

654
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,919
and then just dropped off and I was

655
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,319
lucky enough to get a few of his packs

656
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,360
around like 2018 2019 and we ran the

657
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,480
banana milkshake OG and it was really

658
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,038
good and I was sitting on this pack of

659
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,919
Hannibal OG and c and popped it it was

660
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:24,798
it was nice uh purple buds smelled like

661
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,759
paint thinner and um like aerosol spray

662
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,000
um spray paint or something like that

663
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:32,440
old school

664
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,880
hairspray um it was it was really nice

665
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,558
we crossed it to the banana OG which is

666
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,240
also pretty musky um at least on my end

667
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:46,119
when I had it it seemed pretty musky um

668
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,720
leather kind of but earthy OG for the

669
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,439
most part um but when we cross the two

670
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,600
together you know you're thinking

671
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,360
muskiness a little bit of leather mixed

672
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,558
with some paint thinner you're thinking

673
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:02,119
more along the gas line but a lot of the

674
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,798
fenos came out like green bananas um you

675
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:07,639
know underwrite bananas so that was

676
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:10,278
pretty cool how many preservation jobs

677
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,038
have you done now at least half a dozen

678
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,440
probably a dozen I've probably failed

679
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,000
triple that that

680
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,798
amount you know land race preservation

681
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,119
is is tricky work sometimes the seeds

682
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,679
are olded sometimes they you know get

683
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,398
[ __ ] up

684
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,919
through sometimes you don't know the

685
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:30,759
proper at the time technique to pop

686
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,360
those

687
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:35,440
seeds like code stratification or

688
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,879
something find

689
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,480
something sometimes you just find [ __ ]

690
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,760
that's not worth sometimes you just get

691
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,360
wiped the [ __ ] out sometimes you find

692
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,000
plants that just don't flower and all of

693
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,558
a sudden you're like six months in and

694
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
this plant hasn't stopped vegging it's

695
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,480
like this isn't it something goes from

696
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,599
no balls to trying to bust balls in

697
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,720
couple days pretty early on you have to

698
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,719
find you have to like draw the line for

699
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,679
yourself and tell yourself that you know

700
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,360
I'm going to be selective I'm I'm not

701
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,559
going to like keep a plant just because

702
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:09,959
it's cool or because it holds

703
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,918
sentimental value or because it's from

704
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,840
this region or that region and you just

705
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,559
have to make your Cuts pretty early on

706
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,879
and and stick stick by that so what's

707
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:23,440
been some of your favorite runs to do

708
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,278
with uh the land race

709
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,639
preservation

710
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,159
um a lot of the Afghan and have

711
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,119
been that's it's tough and and then you

712
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:37,200
have the Maru line pretty recently that

713
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:40,439
was really fun uh the Maru red like I

714
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:45,440
talked about uh the females kind of had

715
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:47,679
that rotten body sulfur smell but then

716
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,798
the you know the mes passed on tropical

717
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,240
fruit turps so that that's been really

718
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:57,319
fun and those lwn are really fun to

719
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:01,798
hunt um the Zod cashmere going by back

720
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:04,558
to it um that's that's always fun and

721
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,798
probably um has made for the best

722
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,638
outcrosses as

723
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,558
well patreon member Big Bad John wants

724
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,519
to know what's some of your best tech

725
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:18,398
for popping old

726
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,880
seeds um it depends I I like to do about

727
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,678
a week in the

728
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,440
fridge uh at least a week sometimes a

729
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,240
month it depends depends on the seeds

730
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,240
what they are how they what do they look

731
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,839
like are the seeds really thick like

732
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,880
some hardcore Afghans get really thick

733
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,398
you know they're like Stone Pebbles if

734
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,559
that's the case I'm going to take them

735
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:44,918
and I'm going to scuff them really good

736
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:47,839
do a hydrogen peroxide uh solution mix

737
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,880
you know probably 50/50 with water

738
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,720
nothing

739
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,840
fancy um and then after that I'll pull

740
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,120
them out and I'm a firm believer in

741
00:32:53,839 --> 00:33:00,319
microbes um so I would probably just

742
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,638
inoculate and plant um and then Dome

743
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,918
them if you need

744
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:06,918
to and again a lot of that depends oning

745
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,360
at

746
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:13,399
all I don't um and you know that could

747
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,278
just be me sucking my ways I've probably

748
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:17,278
lost out on some genetics not seed

749
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,880
cracking because I know people that have

750
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:25,200
had good results I've done it manually

751
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,240
before but um for me if if the seeds

752
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,798
don't want to be viable I'll just let

753
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,960
that go I don't really see crack too

754
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:34,000
much I figure yeah like you if it's not

755
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,960
going to pop open let nature take its

756
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,398
course if I do a week solution I'll let

757
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,159
them sit for two or three days that's

758
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:41,079
about the longest I'll let them sit and

759
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,159
then I'll pull out if they don't pop in

760
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:45,960
there then they're gone yeah for the

761
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,960
most part I've pulled them out before

762
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,679
sometimes you can hit them with some

763
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,120
microbes and toss them you know on a

764
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,759
heating pad and a few might pop but gen

765
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,038
generally speaking they're going to be

766
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,759
weaker you know I've I've yet to do that

767
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:02,038
and have a seed just like bust out of

768
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:04,079
the soil and be really vigorous and be

769
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,638
blown away by it and I've been doing

770
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,240
this for a long time it doesn't mean I

771
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,598
couldn't be taught new ways you know

772
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,838
that's that's obviously not the case but

773
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,159
I get it

774
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:16,358
man it took me so long to finally go all

775
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,838
right I'm gonna use an LED like I was

776
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,918
just I love the HIDs man and it is

777
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,480
different like I now that I've been

778
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,918
growing with the LEDs I'm a little bit

779
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,639
more comfortable with them I do

780
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,559
appreciate them for what they are uh I

781
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,320
think with following a proper VPD

782
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,918
knowing your plants knowing how to read

783
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,440
them I've got a little bit better yield

784
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,118
uh now with the LEDs now that they're

785
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,000
dialed in I definitely get better colors

786
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,119
without having to do too much switching

787
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,599
or dimming or dropping temps or anything

788
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,399
like that um but there's something about

789
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,679
those HIDs even though they're a pain in

790
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:53,878
the ass sometimes fighting heat or doing

791
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,440
whatever you know all the duct work you

792
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,319
had to do with them um they threw off

793
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,358
their own style of buds like you could

794
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,559
really get some Hefty Sour Diesel buds

795
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,880
with HIDs you know you really could most

796
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,000
most things they're just not as tight as

797
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,599
a lot of these LEDs are right it's just

798
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
different slightly different structure

799
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,280
and and appearance and all of that D I

800
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,280
tell people all the time one of my

801
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:23,000
favorite grows was interchanging uh HIDs

802
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:27,960
with CM between them I would do like a

803
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:32,519
315 CMH between two 600 watt HIDs and or

804
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:35,400
HPS I guess we should say HS I [ __ ]

805
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:36,719
love that Spectrum you did that too we

806
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,639
were doing the same thing and the

807
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,879
Spectrum was amazing I didn't think it

808
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,799
could be beat and I still I'm not

809
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,119

one one of my favorite lights is

826
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:27,599

827
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:30,239
me to say one of my favorite lights

828
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,519
right now is a just a Mars bar light I I

829
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,919
don't know if it's a 2000 or 3000 what

it came in a box I put it together and

832
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,079
it's killing it it's but I'm just

833
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,519
waiting until you know it glitches out

834
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,440

because I've a ball of I've had those

836

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,400
before and I'll go into my bedroom in

838
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,118
the middle of the night and the light

839

really love the Mars Hydro the only

854
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,599
thing about them is they do produce a

855
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:32,959
lot of heat just because of how they're

856
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,480
built but they're great lights otherwise

857
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,039
it's the company that I'm like H yeah

858

Hop par yet um I know that what I've

875
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,319
seen from farmer McFly looked amazing

876
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:24,399
and um I think he's got a back cross

877
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:27,318
going right now of it so that's really

878
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,440
cool I saw him working with that with a

879
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:31,119
hop par and I just kind of got rid of

880
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,720
mine and moved a different direction you

881
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,519
know uh personally don't want to step on

882
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,838
toes if I see a homie working a

883
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,559
line especially using a mail of

884
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,599
something I'm going to stray a different

885
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,440
direction and then just wait until he's

886
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,838
done and I'm just gonna snag some of his

887
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,280
crosses and run that and just get to the

888
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:52,719
point you know yeah so I I'm at the

889
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,760
point now where um I just kind of want

890
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,199
to run the homies crosses I want to I

891
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,920
want to run some uh some people's work

892
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,559
that have you know worked some of my

893
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,760
gear I'm constantly getting seeds from

894
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,719
people who are using my lines and stuff

895
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,200
and you know at some point it'd be cool

896
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:11,239
to just take a break uh and just kind of

897
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:12,480
grow just not even my stuff grow stuff

898
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:15,598
that they've

899
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,240
produced see what they're doing who

900
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,559
would you say were some of your

901
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:22,799
Inspirations when it came to cannabis

902
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,719
breeding I've been asked this before and

903
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,240
this is one of the trickiest questions

904
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:32,039
for me to answer because um um we really

905
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:35,039
didn't have any um and so for

906
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,920
us I really I really didn't have one and

907
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:41,159
so it wasn't until I started breeding um

908
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,720
later on you know I went a a good decade

909
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,559
without really looking up to anybody

910
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,759
maybe I guess you could say like maybe

911
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,039
Mel Frank or Ed Rosenthal back in the

912
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,680
day um a lot has changed since then I

913
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:56,639
wouldn't say I look up to him now um you

914
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:59,078
kind of get to the point where you see

915
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:03,118
how the sausage is made and you stop

916
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,640
eating sausage at that point um but once

917
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,480
I started breeding it was kind of like

918
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:10,239
bod seeds bod was really cool to me um

919
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,880
coming in you know encouraged me to work

920
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:16,639
with a lot of his stuff gifted me a lot

921
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:20,880
of uh a lot of things and so that was

922
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:23,000
that was cool um and then watching you

923
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,838
know just watching my buddies kind of

924
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,719
kind of work alongside you know back in

925
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:32,039
the old fa group uh book days at Delta 9

926
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,078
THC days that was pretty cool um there

927
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,800
were a lot of people kind of starting

928
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,599
off and then you had like Professor p

929
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,880
and uh dudes like that that were in the

930
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,480
group um everybody was pretty open there

931
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,760
was a lot of open communication and

932
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,960
transparency that you don't get now um

933
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,960
feel like Facebook kind of censored us

934
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,800
out of that everybody shifted to

935
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,480
Instagram now Instagram is Shifting you

936
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:02,519
know and censoring out of Instagram

937
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:06,480
so yeah I've been telling every breeder

938
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:08,719
that I know move to Discord like just

939
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,838
like a website you know that's basically

940
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,838
how you can run it and you just gather

941
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,719
your people there do your thing on

942
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,400
Facebook do your thing on Instagram

943
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,639
everything else is word of mouth but I

944
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,960
think it's way easier for everybody and

945
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,879
everybody that I've made one for really

946
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,240
uh that becomes their spot you know just

947
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,039
like ours is or even like I said I'll

948
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:32,838
send you a link after the show you can

949
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,960
check ours out but you you can you

950
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,199
moderate yourselves you know you decide

951
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,358
what your server is like what you're

952
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,639
going to handle in there and it's just

953
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,838
so much better having that [ __ ] without

954
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,519
the worry of being flagged or taking

955
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:47,880
down or losing your people over [ __ ]

956
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,559
night you know ridiculous you know I was

957
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,440
I was at like 12,000 plus followers and

958
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,519
had years worth of you know pictures

959
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,079
archived and and things like that and

960
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:01,318
then and then lost it all

961
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:04,680
overnight yeah and then and then lost it

962
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:06,159
all overnight you know and it was like

963
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:07,919
getting the followers losing the

964
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,960
followers wasn't a big deal I think most

965
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,760
people can tell you that losing track of

966
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,720
the people you followed is a bigger deal

967
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,119
because even though you're gonna get

968
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,239
something back you're you're gonna lose

969
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,760
touch with a few business yeah and

970
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:22,279

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,559
now um I'm kind of digging into some

989
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,079
like I've I've strayed away from Citrus

990
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:13,880
for so long and because it's just to me

991
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,318
it's vile you know some people like

992
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,760
grapefruit and they like to smoke the

993
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,800
grapefruit for me it's like repulsive

994
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,520
but recently I've been I've been finding

995

mov yeah if it's a second cousin twice

999
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,118

everybody um some people like tested

1142
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:08,079
gear some people don't I get a lot of

1143
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,480
requests for untested gear so um you'll

1144
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:14,039
see me oftentimes release packs

1145
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,400
temporarily for like $20 a pack um if

1146
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,759
people want to buy them and stash them

1147
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,480
and not test them right away they can

1148
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,960
but they're untested and um are

1149
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,559
typically so as

1150
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:31,440
such um for me I like untested gear I I

1151
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,760
almost grow exclusively untested gear um

1152
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,679
probably because I'm getting so many

1153
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,760
seeds sent to me from so many of my

1154
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:41,279

1156
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,480
