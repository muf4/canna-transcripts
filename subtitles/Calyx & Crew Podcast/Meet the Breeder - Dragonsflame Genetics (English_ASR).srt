genetics in here uh he's going to be

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,799
talking about his new lines that he's

15
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,238
coming out with some of the past stuff

16
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,359
that he's done we're gonna have a smoke

17
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,280
session as well so let's introduce him

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,609
without further Ado what's up dragon

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,859
slam how you doing man

20
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,680
[Music]

21
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,079
hey pretty good man thanks for having me

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,180
so let's talk you said you were working

23
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,340
with smaller canopies now you made the

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,600
big move from Hawaii to Oregon so you're

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,118
a little bit closer to us you're in the

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,618
Pacific Northwest now obviously the

27
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,200
climate's got to be a lot better to deal

28
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,420
with especially when you're doing indoor

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,859
um Oregon can be tricky still Oregon can

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,320
still be tricky

31
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,239
yeah especially where we're at

32
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,978
um we kind of went back to where we were

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,978
before we moved to Hawaii so we're back

34
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,319
in the Willamette Valley which does have

35
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,259
a you know fairly

36
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,758
it's nicer than Hawaii's growing season

37
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,978
um but it's still I mean it's certainly

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,319
not the Emerald Triangle we still get

39
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,118
you know some months or some years I

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,459
should say this season will be you know

41
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,219
October 1st and that's all you get and

42
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,078
some years you know you get lucky and

43
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,298
um usually a lot of rain and a lot of

44
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,399
fog and a lot of gray days

45
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,960
um whereas Hawaii was the endless

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,759
humidity that's all you get is the

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,218
humidity

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,840
um so it definitely were

49
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,419
we're kind of just in a rental right now

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,098
but uh we'll be getting a farm again at

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,259
some point but in the meantime we're

52
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,000
we're just doing some indoor

53
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,399
um you know kind of micro I guess you

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,500
could say we've got two five by five

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,080
flower tents and a two by four flower

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,699
tent so it's considerably smaller than

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,319
what I would usually be running but

58
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,659
that's just the sacrifice we had to do

59
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,878
to move

60
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,500
yeah yeah you gotta sacrifice some

61
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,959
things just to keep growing the plants

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,598
sometimes life changes and the plant

63
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,159
just keeps going

64
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,019
yeah what are you working on in those

65
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,939
rooms man what's new with dragonflame

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,879
genetics what's to come

67
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:48,000
so the big projects that I'm focusing in

68
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,159
on for probably the next year or two

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,479
um is going to be my mackberry moonshine

70
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,280
lines I have one tent that I just

71
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,259
um reversed the modified McBerry

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,560
moonshine so that's the GMO to the

73
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:03,239
macberry Moonshine was that original

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,459
um cross and so I have a keeper out of

75
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,099
that that was found by can Essentials

76
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,098
here in Oregon they're a wreck farm and

77
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:16,139
on their first run it was at like 4.6

78
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:18,238
Terps and like 26 THC and then in their

79
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,059
second run it uh went over six percent

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,580
Terps and almost 30 percent THC

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,280
garlic skunk notes

82
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,780
um crushes here in Oregon they uh they

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,180
Run Greenhouse

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,060
um like light supplementation

85
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,560
greenhouses all dialed in but still you

86
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,420
know still an organ Greenhouse you still

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,000
have the humidity um and it's a cut

88
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,559
that's been proven out for them and it's

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,180
uh it's everywhere right now in Oregon

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,439
pretty much uh they're hitting every

91
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,480
dispensary

92
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,219
um here and people are loving it so it's

93
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,318
one

94
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,959
um this reversal didn't make as much

95
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,119
pollen as I was hoping I will make some

96
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,319
seed but I am going to have to reverse

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,239
it again

98
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,399
um to really make the commercial size to

99
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,039
be able to release anyone

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,500
um so that'll that'll happen again

101
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,318
um and then the next my next reversal

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,098
which that cycle is vegging right now is

103
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,298
the blackberry moonshine bx1 reversal so

104
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:15,658
I'm gonna make

105
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,780
um s1s and then I'm also going to make a

106
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:21,000
feminized version of the Holly moonshine

107
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,739
line as I call it which is the

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,800
blackberry moonshine to the modified

109
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,500
macberry moonshine so it has the Mac

110
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,259
Berry on both sides just you know

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,860
different moms but the same dad on both

112
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:37,319
crosses so it should be

113
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,419
more consistent than like a normal F1

114
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,699
you know it'll have more of the same

115
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:44,099
traits from having the same lineages but

116
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,319
it'll still it should still have that

117
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,460
that Vigor that we all you know that we

118
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,019
all want

119
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,459
those are the

120
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,319
yeah those are the big ones for the for

121
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,839
the next year anyway

122
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,899
that aioli looked really good

123
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,359
and I'm definitely expecting to to get

124
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,799
some concentrate off that that last one

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,720
that you were talking about

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,060
the Mac Berry moonshine that sounds

127
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
delicious

128
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,879
yeah it is it um generally comes out

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,639
with like a tangerine candy or like a

130
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,819
tangerine kind of uh

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,079
sweet Funk kind of going on

132
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,680
um it's generally how the macberry

133
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,959
Moonshine that itself is

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,519
um and then the blackberry moonshine bx1

135
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:32,219
has more of the fuel sour

136
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,639
um raunch kind of to it and then the

137
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,840
modified has that garlic from the GMO

138
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:42,300
and like some skunky you know Sour Notes

139
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,659
it doesn't have like the Thai food side

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,939
of the GMO which you know some people

141
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,919
love GMO some people hate it

142
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,379
um it makes it great crosses and get

143
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,240
people love it for concentrates

144
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,639
um but you know not everyone loves the

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,879
terp

146
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,319
yeah absolutely speaking of nasty stuff

147
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,819
I've got to bring it up because there's

148
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,740
so many of my followers that have been

149
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,560
growing it we've talked about it before

150
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,720
and how much I love it uh the garlic

151
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,918
stash man is there any new plans working

152
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,919
with the garlic stash

153
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:20,220
um I it won't be this year but I do what

154
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,400
I want to do with that line is I want to

155
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,720
find a male out of that garlic stash and

156
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,779
I want to hit it to the modified

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,940
macberry that's that's my short-term

158
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,978
plan and at the same time I probably

159
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,139
will when I hunt through the line

160
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,318
looking for the mail I'll probably look

161
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,780
through females as well and you'll see

162
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,759
see if I can find a good uh breeder mom

163
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,000
that I could keep to you know maybe

164
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,060
reverse someday but I love the garlic

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Terps I find them so

166
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,839
anti-stress you know that's a big thing

167
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,660
with the I find with the garlic is it's

168
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,038
really good powerful smoke that you can

169
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,380
function and you can get through your

170
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,000
day and you know there's a lot of crazy

171
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,500
[ __ ] going on in the world so there's a

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,720
lot to get stressed out about and it's

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,199
just one that it just kind of helps melt

174
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,000
that away so I definitely you know I'm

175
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm going to be putting more garlic into

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,418
more of my lines especially for the next

177
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,418
year

178
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:18,599
that that's a good news man because

179
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:20,519
back when you first made that one uh are

180
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,400
you familiar with okay calyx at all

181
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,698
we've had him on the show before

182
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,698
um somewhat

183
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,080
somewhat personally but I've you know

184
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,839
through social media and such

185
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,240
he he grew that uh garlic stash for

186
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,339
quite a while and the constant trade-off

187
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,079
that was so freaking beautiful man

188
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,538
there's

189
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,359
quite a few cultivars out there nowadays

190
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,098
that have or they claim to have a garlic

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,439
chirp but I have not come across

192
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:52,379
anything quite like the garlic stash

193
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,879
where it was like that even GMO where it

194
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:59,038
was that overwhelming [ __ ] garlicky

195
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,079
oniony nastiness and I love it I love

196
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,659
that yeah

197
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,139
yeah I'm a big fan and I think like the

198
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,120
GMO I I like it by itself but I actually

199
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,139
prefer it in crosses I like to get away

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,139
from kind of that that that cookie side

201
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,840
of it and get more into just a straight

202
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,639
sour the straight raunch

203
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,918
um because with a GMO you still have

204
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,220
that under bite of

205
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,560
Thai food and kind of cookie-esque

206
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,240
um note to it it's one that is

207
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,299
especially depending on how far into

208
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,700
flower you take a GMO can be a pretty

209
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,439
you know GMO to eight weeks and GMO at

210
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,120
13 weeks you wouldn't even believe it's

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,620
the same damn plant

212
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,658
um so I mean it could be pretty

213
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,519
different

214
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:48,299
where do you like to take it down

215
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,278
where's your Harvest frame on the GMO

216
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,679
um pretty much as a blanket statement

217
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:54,838
I'll say I take everything way further

218
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,579
than most people do

219
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,160
um I smoke pretty much from the time I

220
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,740
get up to the time I go to bed I have a

221
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,559
[ __ ] up tolerance

222
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,019
um so I mean I'm I'm an all-day heavy

223
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,759
smoker and so the the early Harvest just

224
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,179
doesn't have enough potency for me I

225
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:15,059
like the I like to I like it really ripe

226
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,399
uh generally like I hear people say

227
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,979
eight weeks and 10 weeks and I'm like

228
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,958
I'm not really even looking at shopping

229
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,700
at eight weeks unless I'm outdoor in the

230
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,599
you know the weather is forcing me to

231
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,640
but

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,560
indoors I don't pull anything usually

233
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,159
under 10 or 11 if it's something for me

234
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,958
to smoke and usually more like 12 13 is

235
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,139
usually where I take things to you

236
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,458
really get the the full term profile and

237
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,740
the full potency that you're going to

238
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,659
get out of the line going deep

239
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,360
that takes a lot of patience going that

240
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,399
long man congrats on that one uh are you

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,659
seeing any different in the outcrossings

242
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,820
that you're making with like the

243
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:54,559
mackberry Moonshine is that Harvest Time

244
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,560
a little bit sooner is it about the same

245
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,600
um most of my selections have been done

246
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,699
in tough climates so generally just by

247
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,080
that fact I'm usually taking the faster

248
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,459
phenos

249
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,200
um that's just you know that's part of

250
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,639
how I have to select when I've been in

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,560
tough climates

252
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,480
so generally the longer I work something

253
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,419
the faster it's going to flower just

254
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,879
based on how I select plants

255
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,679
um and especially in Hawaii because the

256
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,620
days are so consistent and because it's

257
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,838
tropical and so close to the equator

258
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,639
especially in Hawaii things just flower

259
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,680
so much faster

260
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,500
that's for sure

261
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,419
um you had a ton of challenges going

262
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,639
over there in Hawaii you told me about

263
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,860
that last time would you like to tell

264
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,000
our followers a little bit about what

265
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,159
makes growing in Hawaii so [ __ ] hard

266
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,458
yeah I mean if you take just a simple

267
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,039
fact that it's 3 000 miles away from a

268
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,899
land mass and everything is shipped in

269
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,539
um so across the board everything is

270
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,278
three times more expensive

271
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,819
um you know like a bag of soil here on

272
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:03,838
the mainland you know 15 bucks for a bag

273
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,180
of box Farms on in Hawaii is 35 to 50 if

274
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,980
they even have it and then the actual

275
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,059
climate itself fights you at every step

276
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,980
of the way

277
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,679
um like at our spot we were at 900 foot

278
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,039
elevation uh we were about six miles

279
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:21,359
away as the crow flies to the ocean and

280
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:24,120
at our spot 300 to 500 inches of rain a

281
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,220
year is pretty average and normal for

282
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,480
that climate zone

283
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:33,120
um daily the humidity would usually be

284
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,039
no lower than 80 percent most days it'd

285
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
be you know closer to 90 percent in the

286
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,578
day time

287
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:44,759
and and then at night 99 humidity every

288
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:48,359
single night there's no Frost so there's

289
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,278
nothing no snow nothing ever resets your

290
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,240
pest pressures and your fungus pressures

291
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:58,200
so everything can breed year-round

292
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:01,799
fungus uh you know from mites to

293
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,560
I mean every every pest basically can

294
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,019
grow unchecked and also because it's so

295
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,699
isolated most of the things that we

296
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,419
would consider to be beneficial that

297
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,879
would

298
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:16,019
somewhat put a pressure back onto the

299
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:19,259
pet doesn't exist so it's a it's a real

300
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,879
recipe for a petri dish effect where

301
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,759
um you know you're in the jungle and

302
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,958
every single if it if it lives in the

303
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,819
jungle it's going to be in your garden

304
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,879
then there's no preventing it you can

305
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,700
deal with it as best you can

306
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:37,078
um but I mean I would find I'd have to

307
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,940
run you know 300 seeds Hawaii itself

308
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,239
would kill the first

309
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,639
[ __ ] 200 Fino is just from mold from

310
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,919
septoria from stem rot

311
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,839
um you know with in that kind of in that

312
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,059
kind of Zone it's it's

313
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,880
it's really tough really tough to grow

314
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,338
and then on top of that even if you you

315
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,039
know the stars align you how you you're

316
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,380
on your game you know you get stuff to

317
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,019
the Finish Well you're in a zone that

318
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,059
the humidity is never less than 85 so

319
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,940
then you go okay well how do you dry and

320
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:11,819
cure flour off grid

321
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,160
when it's 85 humidity and there's no

322
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,560
easy answer to that except for you know

323
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,778
boatloads of infrastructure and money in

324
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,578
order to overcome the climate and then

325
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,200
like even let's say you're with your

326
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:25,859
buddies and you got some fire and you

327
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,959
roll a joint and you roll it too slow or

328
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,220
someone starts talking you know and then

329
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,599
you go to light it well it's picked up

330
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,800
all the humidity and now it's not gonna

331
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,778
you're not gonna be able to smoke it

332
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,159
because it's too damn wet

333
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:37,860
um so I mean it's

334
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,740
as a grower and as a smoker it's a it's

335
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,079
a really goddamn challenging place

336
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,940
yeah that's I mean a lot of people don't

337
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,559
even consider things like that with that

338
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,959
kind of humidity it's going to be hard

339
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,719
to spray anything keep anything you know

340
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,759
uh pest resistant at all or you know

341
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,579
kill off the bugs that you already have

342
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,338
that's pretty [ __ ] intense man

343
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:02,299
yeah it's a tough place and then on top

344
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:06,300
of that you add a culture that

345
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:08,159
I'm an outsider I mean I'm I'm according

346
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:09,838
to them I'm the epitome of what they

347
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,059
don't like they don't like

348
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,700
people that come from the mainland buy a

349
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:17,518
piece of property you know it's

350
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,920
according to them it's their it's their

351
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,720
Island it's their you know it's their

352
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,338
spot they don't want people there

353
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,240
and when you're on a and when you're on

354
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,920
a rock in the middle of the ocean

355
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,539
there's no hiding

356
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,099
um you know everyone knows your business

357
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,039
everyone knows who you are everyone

358
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,040
knows if you're not a local everyone

359
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,958
knows and that makes you a Target

360
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,519
um so I mean from security Community

361
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,419
Vibes yep

362
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,299
yep you uh you know it's a

363
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:47,639
you have to absolutely love it it's it's

364
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,740
the most expensive state to live so you

365
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,180
have to [ __ ] love it and we didn't I

366
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,399
mean that's what it came down to for us

367
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,979
is we didn't love it enough to

368
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,559
to deal with it and we are so much

369
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,480
happier to be back here with family and

370
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,458
you know you don't know what you have

371
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,680
until it's gone type of thing and we

372
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,479
didn't realize how how big it would be

373
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,698
and then the pandemic hit so we weren't

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,860
even able to travel off the island for

375
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:13,679
[ __ ] 18 months

376
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,860
um so I mean it was it was a it was a

377
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,599
cauldron of of of stress and you know

378
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,300
trying to figure it out and trying to

379
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,620
overcome these obstacles and

380
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,659
um you know we're happy we did it we

381
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,698
learned a lot I [ __ ] especially about

382
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:29,159
cannabis and

383
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:31,458
um and my genetics in particular

384
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,559
um I learned a lot I learned the

385
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:36,599
exactly like exactly the threshold of

386
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,119
what cannabis can take and what each

387
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,040
line itself can take

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,959
that's awesome man yeah there's no way

389
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,819
to really learn that unless you're

390
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,419
thrown into it right

391
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,980
oh yeah I mean I I was humbled really

392
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,319
quick I thought you know I've been

393
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,180
growing a long time I was like oh figure

394
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,879
it out you know how hard could it be we

395
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,979
got this yeah I got this little you know

396
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,139
I'll have a rough Runner too is what I

397
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,839
figured and

398
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,799
you know and I get there and you know

399
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,320
it's it's constant pain there yeah being

400
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,139
over in that environment that obviously

401
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,778
had some Play Into You breeding towards

402
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,600
you know uh moisture resistance and the

403
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:20,220
high humidity and rot uh botrytis and

404
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,778
things like this

405
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,339
um is that something that you think

406
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:26,000
you're going to continue breeding for

407
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,000
being an organ

408
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:33,659
um yes in the long term yes

409
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,899
um at this exact this year of my life no

410
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:39,659
just because I'm indoor only

411
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,860
um you know indoor I can't like if you

412
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,500
don't have the pressure you can't select

413
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,800
for it so for the next year I'm going to

414
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,778
be focusing more on feminized lines and

415
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,319
lines that are

416
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:54,720
um I hate to use the word hype or you

417
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,820
know exotic or whatever you want to call

418
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
it but more

419
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,920
um show body type lines you know more

420
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:05,599
indoor type stuff is going to be what's

421
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,599
coming out for at least the next year

422
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,559
nothing wrong with that man nothing

423
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,780
wrong with that at all

424
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,899
um we have a question from a follower I

425
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:18,058
think it's one of yours uh course says

426
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,798
any chance you ever plan on doing a

427
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,439
one-to-one

428
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:25,679
yeah I actually have

429
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,660
um two or three that I've made

430
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,460
um the big one that you know I pretty

431
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,660
much pass it to anyone that wants it I

432
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,200
don't charge for it I call it the

433
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:37,558
dragons remedy it's the uh sour tsunami

434
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,080
cut to the dragon stash and it's pretty

435
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,019
easy to find the one-to-one stuff and

436
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:48,119
then you can also find

437
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:51,720
some some more like 15 to 17 CBD and

438
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:54,779
like three to five percent THC Pinos as

439
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,380
well and that one it has a nice chirp it

440
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:00,720
kind of has that Sour Diesel

441
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,240
esque with some berries or some Citrus

442
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,100
coming from the dragon stack side

443
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,140
um and that one you know I've got a lot

444
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,819
of C that I made a lot of them and you

445
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,919
know anyone can DM me and I'll send them

446
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,779
a pack of the dragon's remedy

447
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,880
that sounds awesome man that's something

448
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,460
I definitely need to get into he's been

449
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,160
pushing me to to smoke more of the CBD

450
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,660
Heavies to get off cigarette smoke

451
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,360
so that might be something I'll be

452
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,580
hitting you up about pretty here

453
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:31,038
um yeah pandas says which garlic stash

454
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,038
do you prefer the 13 or the 21.

455
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:41,519
um I personally prefer the 21 the 21 has

456
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:45,298
more of the GMOs garlic side more of the

457
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,279
skunk side more of the um

458
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:52,319
you know more of the parts of the GMO

459
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:56,038
that I like the 13 is more ogkb heavy

460
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:58,678
and comes out more garlic cookie forward

461
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:02,700
it definitely has more of that dough

462
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:05,640
side that you know cookies is known for

463
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,620
um the 13 flowers much faster like most

464
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,720
people are seeing you know most people

465
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,599
like people that like seven to nine

466
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,660
weeks and then the 21 is more in line

467
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:18,899
with the dragon stash GMO side which is

468
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,419
you know 9 to 11 is generally where I

469
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,059
see people pulling the 21 so it really

470
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,919
comes down to your preference

471
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:28,500
thank you

472
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,000
GGG wants to know will Jeff continue to

473
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,038
expand the land race heirloom

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,960
preservation in unique crosses he's done

475
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:37,140
in the past

476
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,940
yeah yeah I don't know which ones I'm

477
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,840
gonna do next

478
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,720
um

479
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,579
probably I think the next one I'm gonna

480
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,759
do is I think I'm going to continue my

481
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:50,819
panamanium line which is the Panama Red

482
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,099
to the bengi haze I took that

483
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,859
yeah it's a really fun one

484
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,899

492
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:24,720
like a faster flowering

493
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,240
subcompact Haze you know that one's like

494
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,880
you know made for made for the shorter

495
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,380
season is where that baby Haze went

496
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,780
um so it kind of has something that you

497
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,880
can do outdoors in the Panamanian like

498
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,538
most Growers would be able to finish it

499
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,900
and so it's not so exact or so thin leaf

500
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:45,058
that you know it takes a Madman to to

501
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,259
try to do it

502
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:47,940
um I'm probably going to take that one

503
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,339
to F3

504
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,679
um that'll probably be the next one and

505
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,839
then I also want to get

506
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,280
um I want to take the Vietnamese black

507
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,159
one more step

508
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,740
I feel like that one I it needs uh I did

509
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,200
I already did an open pollination on it

510
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,640
and now I want to do my next one I

511
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,500
actually want to select I want to go

512
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,720
through and I want to find a find the

513
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,019
best email that I can

514
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,240
um but that will probably be

515
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,558
now a while down the road at least a

516
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,660
year I'd say

517
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,058
I don't think I knew that you did an OP

518
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,558
of that uh Vietnamese black that's

519
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,058
pretty awesome man I've been wanting to

520
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,819
grow that one for a long time what'd you

521
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:29,220
find in that uh heritage

522
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:32,480
yeah we did a Vietnamese black and then

523
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,960
we also did a Vietnamese a lot in Hawaii

524
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,179
and so the black is more like swamp

525
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,519
Terps

526
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,059
um there was like some cedar wood

527
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:48,658
Sandalwood kind of Terps in there

528
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:51,359
um there was some like Pine Saul

529
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,059
um we had one that was like um kind of

530
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,339
like geraniums kind of like that herbal

531
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:59,700
tea almost

532
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:02,399
um and then the lot was more like sharp

533
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,860
Citrus and sharp lacquer like really

534
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,919
more nose assaulting

535
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:09,538
um whereas the black was more like

536
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,880
Pleasant it's kind of I don't know if

537
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:15,359
I'm conveying what I mean but

538
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,280
um they're both really racy uh really

539
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,719
long flower

540
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,519
um growing them next to each other you

541
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,140
would believe that that they are both

542
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,339
from Vietnam but they are a little

543
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,020
different

544
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:29,119
um that's a lot uh will go more colorful

545
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:32,400
especially towards the end of flower

546
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,699
whereas the Vietnamese black is more

547
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,519
like straight black

548
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,679
so is that something you said would say

549
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,538
it was true breeding for is that black

550
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,120
color yeah

551
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:46,919
that's impressive how about the high off

552
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,798
of it what was the high like

553
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,600
heard mixed reviews

554
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,918
um well I mean if it depends on if you

555
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,918
like thin leaves

556
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,120
um it's it's definitely [ __ ] potent

557
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,280
um if you don't like if you don't like

558
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,719
thin leaves it's gonna be uh really

559
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,298
overpowering

560
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,860
um it's pretty it's easy to overdo

561
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,740
there's no ceiling like the more you

562
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:10,699
smoke I mean it's pretty soaring

563
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,700
um I won't say it

564
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,240
um some people find it paranoid I

565
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:17,158
personally didn't and my wife didn't

566
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,319
um I know some people though some people

567
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,080
just get paranoid off of thin Leaf so I

568
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,399
can't really say on that I didn't get

569
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,178
paranoid

570
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,700
um but it definitely it's a racy you

571
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:33,240
know nothing like modern genetics

572
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,600
um there's absolutely no bag appeal no

573
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,940
you know it's really wispy

574
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,619
um long flower I mean it's

575
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,919
you're not gonna You're Not Gonna Fill

576
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:46,319
rooms with it I mean appeal means so

577
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,299
much to people these days it does some

578
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,359
of the best smokes I've had are from the

579
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:54,480
worst looking buds oh I almost guarantee

580
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,158
it you know 90 of the time the only time

581
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,900
I've ever found it not to be true was

582
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,020
the dragon stash

583
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,840
um and that's that was pure pure dumb

584
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,460
luck the the redfinos end up being the

585
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,500
terpiest

586
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,120
um every other line I've ever seen you

587
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,740
know usually the green Fino smells

588
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,178
better it's you know usually the way it

589
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,159
goes

590
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,059
tips straight from Dragon slime genetics

591
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,980
because hey it's big in the market

592
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:19,200
though right now I mean people want the

593
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,779
fast flowering and they want purple and

594
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,298
they want gas I mean that seems to be

595
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,980
and they want hype and they want Femmes

596
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,679
I mean that's that's what I hear anyway

597
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,500
from everyone that bends my seeds they

598
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,240
all ask us all ask the same questions

599
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,159
yeah and you've really been getting into

600
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,519
the Femmes I do want to talk about that

601
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,020
quite a bit what was it that calling for

602
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,418
people asking for your genetics

603
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,599
feminized that made you get into it

604
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:49,500
or were you [ __ ] around with it

605
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:51,538
um it actually was more so because I

606
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,319
wanted to preserve cuts

607
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:58,019
um Hawaii decimated my library nearly

608
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,178
every everything from the last six to

609
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,379
eight years that I've hunted Hawaii

610
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,298
killed it

611
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,220
um I have a few things that I put into

612
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:07,619
tissue culture with node Labs that I'll

613
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,319
be able to get back but

614
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,359
um I pretty much crop after crop watch

615
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,879
more of my mom's die off and so I that's

616
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,219
why I wanted to get into Femmes

617
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,860
um I reversed my orange dreams keeper

618
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,538
which I no longer have so I'm so so

619
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,000
thankful that I was able to reverse it

620
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:26,400
before Hawaii killed it

621
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,798
um so that's that's why I got into

622
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,640
Femmes is because of

623
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,798
the understanding and especially now

624
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,778
when I first started growing and when I

625
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,700
would be buying seeds I would never buy

626
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:40,380
them you know usually if I'm gonna buy a

627
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,940
seed line I'm looking for males as well

628
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,140
because I want to continue I want to

629
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,980
work the line

630
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,259
so and then on top of that most of the

631
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,980
Femmes that I had run that I had seen

632
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:55,500
run you know the early process that a

633
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,360
lot of people used through like

634
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,460
stressing or through root cutting

635
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,099
there's all kinds of crazy ways that

636
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,558
people have huge stress to make uh

637
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,959
feminized seeds it's only more recently

638
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,440
that people have been doing it more like

639
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,140
with you know sprays or STS or the elite

640
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,580
spray which I just I just think it's a

641
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,440
better process

642
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:19,079
um you know anything that's doing the

643
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,700
like the root manipulations to me that's

644
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,500
a stress that the plant should be able

645
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,298
to overcome like I'm trying to breed

646
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,700
stronger lines and so I've personally

647
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,859
always kind of

648
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,659
not been too impressed with Femmes just

649
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,038
because of the process of how to make

650
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,919
them

651
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,058
um so it's been more the longer I've you

652
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,038
know I've been in the game and the more

653
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:40,200
I've seen the more research I've done

654
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,599
and the more people I've seen doing

655
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,659
feminism doing them right especially you

656
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,639
know my mind just kind of opened to them

657
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:50,039
but I do know Market wise that's what

658
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,299
people want more than regulars so I mean

659
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,759
it's kind of

660
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:56,099
it's kind of both really it's you know

661
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,119
serving the need and you know doing what

662
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,119
made sense for me at the time

663
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,519
absolutely man

664
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,980
um you said you you make your own spray

665
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,619
right your own reversal spray

666
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,960
yeah these every time I've done it I

667
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:15,178
have I think I think I'm gonna try next

668
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,960
time I'm gonna use the pre-made Elite

669
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,220
spray this uh last one well actually all

670
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,259
three of them really like the orange

671
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,179
dreams didn't really want to reverse

672
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,960
either it did

673
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,179
um

674
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,759
and I you know I did get a good amount

675
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,740
of seeds of a few of the lines

676
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,798
um and then the Mac Dragon reversal that

677
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,679
one went really well but I also sprayed

678
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,079
12 huge plants so I had

679
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,419
you know back up the backups I had a

680
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,519
whole Army of plant matter that I was

681
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,620
that was being sprayed so just by the

682
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,200
sheer size of what I was able to do I

683
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:51,239
had enough to pollinate the greenhouse

684
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,519
and then I tried with the

685
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,460
um GMO cut and it wouldn't reverse for

686
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,519
me and then I just did the modified and

687
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,620
it did like it made male pollen sacks

688
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,158
and a few of them did have pollen but

689
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:06,538
for the 99 of them were totally pollen

690
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,980
free

691
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,538
um so I think the next time I'm going to

692
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,159
try the elite

693
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,140
um stuff and see if you know if I can

694
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,659
get a better reversal out of it

695
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,640
so do you think the amount of pollen

696
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,039
that comes off of these females is it

697
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,659
directly related to like the type of

698
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,339
reversal spray that you use or the

699
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,620
compounds that you use on it or do you

700
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:28,079
think there's some genetics that the

701
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,298
females just just like males there's

702
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,519
some that just naturally don't make very

703
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:33,900
much seed or drop very much pollen even

704
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,440
though they're great

705
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,440
yeah I

706
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,418
I it's both factors some females are

707
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,960
just really hard to reverse

708
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,778
um

709
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,000
you know and some like the orange dreams

710
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:50,038
the thing with that one is that one was

711
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,919
it was making a [ __ ] ton of pollen but

712
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,140
the problem was it was so dense and so

713
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,720
thick I mean that's what that line does

714
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,520
is it makes huge football colas and so

715
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,980
it was actually so dense that the pollen

716
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,658
sacks wouldn't open properly so all the

717
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,700
pollen that I was able to get and what

718
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,640
actually seeded was for me

719
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,740
literally manually opening pulling

720
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,720
everything apart because anywhere that

721
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,179
the pollen just would stick to the

722
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,278
cluster it would mold really fast like

723
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,080
within two days you'd go out and not be

724
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:20,640
moldy and you'd look and you'd

725
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:22,259
investigate and pull it apart and it's

726
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,600
like oh well there is a big old glob of

727
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,099
pollen that fell out that just stuck

728
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,719
right there on the plant matter and

729
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,819
molded

730
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,100
um and then some plants you know it's

731
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,558
just some are finicky

732
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:37,558
um you know as soon as just the nature

733
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,298
of farming it and it's

734
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,339
um you know it's how much effort you

735
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:43,079
want to put into it like the like the

736
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:44,939
modified I'm gonna get the damn thing to

737
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,220
reverse I'm gonna make seed off of it it

738
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,840
might take me a few tries but it's gonna

739
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,200
happen

740
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,298
um so I mean it's it's it's farming is

741
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,558
always it's always a pain in the ass I

742
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,940
mean there's always there's always

743
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:59,038
something it's still like always

744
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,019
something

745
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,240
I mean like the perfect example like the

746
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,220
and even males do this as I guess my

747
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,659
example like the last cycle in Hawaii

748
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,220
that we did

749
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,600
it was kind of funny we had already

750
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,298
decided that we were going to put the

751
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,240
farm up for sale we hadn't decided time

752
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:18,240
yet and I so I had a crumble cake mail

753
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,500
that when I stress tested it it was

754
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,079
[ __ ] phenomenal solid beautiful

755
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,058
took way more abuse than what I thought

756
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,639
it was going to be able to especially I

757
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,859
mean that's a cookie type line

758
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,159
um and so in the stress testing it was

759
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:37,740
solid and so I had a whole Greenhouse 12

760
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,760
by 30 foot Greenhouse I mean beautiful

761
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,519
plants huge mail I would have made

762
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:47,038
mountains of seed and um it through

763
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,418
female parts it didn't do it in stress

764
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,278
testing but it did

765
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,860
and what should have been the cake run

766
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:55,980
you know it was getting fed everything

767
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:58,619
was a quote unquote on track

768
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,319
um and so that's actually because for me

769
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,359
if if a male throws female parts it's a

770
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,639
wash like that's not worth breeding with

771
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,898
so it was like I chopped the garden down

772
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,980
and I went up and told my wife and I was

773
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,418
like well I think we just got the

774
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,880
[ __ ] sign that we're out of here

775
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:13,440
because that cycle that we were waiting

776
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,299
on just

777
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,798
maybe that was The Universe telling us

778
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:18,240
to get the [ __ ] off a rock I don't know

779
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,639
but

780
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,839
um anyway that I mean that and that's

781
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,460
with a male that already had gone

782
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,778
through stress testing so I mean it's

783
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,000
that's farming

784
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,579
so I have a huge question to ask you

785
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,619
here you mentioned males throwing off

786
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,058
female parts I've actually talked to a

787
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:34,199
couple breeders where they said they

788
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,778
prefer

789
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,700
males like that because they hold that

790
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:41,278
female genetic and The Offspring are

791
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,460
more likely to produce feminized uh

792
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,500
progeny what do you think about that

793
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,778
I think that's gross science I think

794
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,538
Herman's Herm that's all I think um

795
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:54,058
instability is instability no matter how

796
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:55,980
you slice it if a plant is willing to

797
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:58,558
harm and you use it you are passing

798
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,000
along genetics that have the propensity

799
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,000
to harm

800
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,798
um and for me this is uh This is my

801
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,599
legacy this is what I leave for the

802
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,759
[ __ ] world right so for me

803
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:11,699
you know I try to do the absolute best

804
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,259
work I can and I personally people don't

805
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,600
forget when you see that one of their

806
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:18,798
rooms they do not forget that it has

807
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:21,538
something that you know uh leaves a mark

808
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,839
it does it does

809
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:26,398
um you know [ __ ] up someone

810
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:29,759
yeah oh it's never their fault it's

811
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:32,579
always it's always the breeder

812
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,099
so just to play devil's advocate here

813
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:37,500
you're saying absolutely no instability

814
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:40,558
is instability how about

815
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,140
males that throw resin that are heavy on

816
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,558
resin that's usually typically a female

817
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,940
you know trait uh males always have a

818
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,500
certain amount of resin but the ones

819
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,500
that are overly coated with it

820
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,038
I love those males those are the ones

821
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,440
that I tend to look for

822
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,839
um if a male has grief then I usually

823
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,820
The Prodigy will have grease and I

824
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,199
shouldn't even say what people want to

825
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:07,200
do with what they're going to run for

826
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,419
themselves have a happy like some of the

827
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,600
greatest strains in cannabis history are

828
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:14,759
accidents I mean that's that's the way

829
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,798
you know what I mean so

830
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,480
it's more just

831
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,158
it's understanding that if you're

832
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,538
passing that along in your genetics and

833
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,860
then you're selling those genetics

834
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,740
that's

835
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,359
friends and even still if you have a

836
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,099
male that does that that does throw

837
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,959
let's say it throws a few hairs let's

838
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:33,298
say it throws a [ __ ] hundred hairs I

839
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,340
mean let's go to both extremes

840
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:37,740
if you run through the genetics yourself

841
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:39,480
you actually test those seeds and you

842
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,640
stress test those seeds and you see oh

843
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,880
well they're solid the male might have

844
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,038
had issues but if that didn't get passed

845
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,419
along but that's where stress testing

846
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,119
comes in and that's where you know

847
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,200
running those seeds and you know

848
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,018
everyone has their own different

849
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,940
standards you know this is every time I

850
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,319
open Instagram there's 100 new breeders

851
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,659
so I mean this is everyone's different

852
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,898
standards everyone has their own

853
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:05,820
paintbrush so to speak for me I don't

854
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,460
want to grow Herms I don't want to sell

855
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:11,338
Herm seed so for me from for my

856
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,260
collections a Herm is a kilt

857
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:15,838
that that's a solid Point that's

858
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,780
something that I get behind for sure I

859
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,338
find it very important to uh do stress

860
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,859
testing on any genetics that you're

861
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:24,898
providing there's a lot of people I mean

862
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:26,759
I'm not going to say names but there's

863
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,579
one guy in specific that drives me

864
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,280
insane and he always talks about how

865
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:35,219
cannabis naturally has that

866
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,379
hermaphrodite trait because of its uh

867
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,059
ability to reproduce itself even if it

868
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:40,319
doesn't get pollinated to carry on those

869
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:43,679
genetics

870
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,480
so his claim is that you don't have to

871
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,700
stress test any of these seeds there's

872
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,219
going to be Herms and everything how do

873
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,799
you feel about that

874
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,358
that's an interesting standard to have I

875
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,980
mean if we're going to go off of that I

876
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,179
mean think of all the plants that we

877
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,320
have made

878
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:03,779
off of so I mean that

879
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,960
that's our job as breeders in my opinion

880
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:11,040
is to push the line forward and to make

881
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,220
the line better for the for the next run

882
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,500
um and so for me yeah there are a lot of

883
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,299
lines that do that it is a

884
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,440
self-preservation tactic that is a

885
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,359
hundred percent true it is a

886
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,059
self-preservation tactic and it's our

887
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,039
job as at least for me anyway it's my

888
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:28,799
job as a breeder to minimize that to

889
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,960
remove it from as best I can from lines

890
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,000
and if it's present like perfect example

891
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,199
I made the peanut butter breath orange

892
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,800
dreams

893
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:41,699
about 30 of them harm that's like I've

894
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,560
you know 20 30 that's probably even

895
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,598
higher than what it really is it just

896
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,779
sticks out in my mind so I always over

897
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,000
exaggerate for in my mind

898
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,040
but the ones that don't harm are

899
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,199
phenomenal and so I've had people that

900
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,300
are like oh bro you know I got this from

901
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,460
this person or that person and it was

902
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,079
phenomenal I want to grow it and I tell

903
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,940
them well I don't sell those seeds

904
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,619
they're they harm this is their you know

905
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,000
their rate I've had people that are like

906
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,440
well I don't give a [ __ ] I want to run

907
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,119
them anyway

908
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,039
you know everyone can make their own

909
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,180
their own choice for their garden and

910
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,980
you know

911
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:16,019
some people a lot of people have

912
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,420
actually come out of that line which to

913
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:19,980
me was a wasted project like once I saw

914
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,358
that that rate was that high to me like

915
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,500
it just sits in the back of my fridge

916
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,480
and

917
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,940
C'est La Vie you know maybe I'll use it

918
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,219
for a seed Sprout tea someday but that's

919
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,320
you know that's about it but

920
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,019
yeah everyone that I saved mine for and

921
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,619
I didn't see a big uh I didn't see a big

922
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:39,380
jump over like a corn SST so yeah we end

923
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,640
up just being food

924
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,820
boil them shuck them put them on salad

925
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:48,900
we're good yeah so what would you say

926
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,900
was an acceptable hermery

927
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,899
um

928
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:57,118
that's a very varied question

929
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,460
um and something that I release I don't

930
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,800
want to see more than one or two hearing

931
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,900
reports and um for those Herm reports I

932
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,359
want them to have a reason and I want to

933
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,960
be able to find the reason

934
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:12,179
um but generally you know I my standard

935
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,980
is I expect that everyone that popped a

936
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:16,559
pack of my seat is going to find

937
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,240
something terpy something that they can

938
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,858
finish in their climate zone something

939
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,618
that has resistance

940
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:24,900
you know that's great smoke in every

941
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,000
pack that's basically where my standard

942
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,039
is and if they can't if that can't be

943
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,320
done then you know

944
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,300
like my fridge is full of lines it's

945
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,980
ridiculous it's easy to make seed let me

946
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,200
just say that it is really easy to make

947
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,320
seed but making sure that it's actually

948
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,358
worth something and you know worth

949
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,640
growing because I mean I know how it is

950
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,799
for me I only have so much space what I

951
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,559
put in that space matters and I know

952
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,619
that that's that's more of the norm than

953
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,420
oh well we go ham you can pop whatever

954
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,039
the hell you want so

955
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,480
you know that's what that's what I try

956
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:00,480
to aim for

957
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,699
absolutely I I appreciate you saying

958
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,519
that man definitely you can breed for

959
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:08,098
stability that's absolutely

960
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,539
um doable and these people that are

961
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,880
telling you you know it doesn't matter

962
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:14,880
it does they're just not willing to put

963
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,400
in the work as far as I'm concerned

964
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,519
so let me ask you the hard question now

965
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,920
out of everything that you've ever made

966
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:26,460
let's say top three what would be the

967
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:30,180
top three strengths so far that you go I

968
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,220
want this to represent what I've done

969
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:33,719
well the first one would be easy dragon

970
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,899
stash

971
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:37,559
um that is the sum of

972
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,720
um

973
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,400
you know all of my time growing and

974
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,959
breeding has gone into making that

975
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,579
strain

976
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,980
um and it's going to be one that I'm

977
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,380
going to continue working in fact I

978
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,740
actually just ran out of

979
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,200
um the F3 Green version so it's probably

980
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:57,959
going to move up the list because that

981
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,939
is our Flagship line

982
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,099
um you know the so I've got the red

983
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,579
version and I've got the Green version

984
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:10,740
F3 of the Dragon stash the red version

985
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:13,680
tends to go like blueberry fuel

986
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:16,679
um blueberry funk you know generally

987
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,379
those are the words that I hear

988
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:23,279
um when people describe the blue are the

989
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,800
the dragon stash red Fino the green is

990
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,560
more like a citrus Kush

991
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,740
um or like a sour Citrus

992
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:35,039
um and not like that Tangy type terp

993
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:38,879
like the actual true citrus peels like

994
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:41,880
actual fresh Citrus not that artificial

995
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,800
like candy Tangy turp

996
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,200
um

997
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,200
and so the number two would probably be

998
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,858
probably the modified mackberry

999
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,500
moonshine

1000
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:58,920
would probably be number two

1001
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,579
yeah it's one I'm I'm really happy with

1002
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,159
um

1003
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:04,079
you know it's a it's it's it's a damn

1004
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,480
good one and so far everyone that's

1005
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,700
tries that loves it

1006
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,300
um I'd say probably number three would

1007
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:14,279
probably be the Missy stash actually

1008
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,220
um which is so that's my wife's favorite

1009
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,019
Congolese Kush to my dragon stash so

1010
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,299
it's basically my wife's favorite strain

1011
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:25,019
to my favorite strain

1012
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,519
um combined into one and that last I

1013
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,380
heard anyway I don't know if it still is

1014
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,440
but it has set the terp record in

1015
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,740
Massachusetts and their legal system at

1016
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,838
like six point like 6.7 is what they had

1017
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,939
set it at

1018
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:40,320
um and it's you know it's one that's

1019
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,700
been really special because obviously

1020
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,019
it's you know one of my wife's favorites

1021
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,379
and one of my favorites so that's

1022
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:48,358
probably

1023
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,320
those those three

1024
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:53,219
um

1025
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,619
the blackberry moonshine probably would

1026
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,299
also like that's probably a close tie to

1027
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,420
Third

1028
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,420
um

1029
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,720
yeah I think I mean there's I've made a

1030
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,279
lot of I may have a lot of lines over

1031
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,019
the years

1032
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,460
um you know so it's really hard to

1033
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:10,380
narrow them down but I'd say those are

1034
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,619
probably the tops

1035
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,960
so let's hear a little bit about what

1036
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:18,119
made you decide to make your own strains

1037
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,519
what brought you in where you going I'm

1038
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,099
gonna try my hand up reading

1039
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,500
yeah so I grew up in California and

1040
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,960
that's where I learned to grow I was in

1041
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,820
like the amateur Calaveras County Line

1042
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,460
area

1043
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,220
um and in that area you could pretty

1044
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,900
much any string could go out in a 200

1045
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:37,980
gallon pot and if you could keep it

1046
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,820
watered

1047
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:44,280
you'd you'd see put the potential that

1048
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,019
plant was you could pretty much finish

1049
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,940
anything

1050
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:50,639
um and then I moved to Oregon after a

1051
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,559
divorce and I brought all of my

1052
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,559
California genetics with me

1053
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:58,799
and that first season in Oregon I got my

1054
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,960
ass handed to me with mold and

1055
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,940
at that time when I was looking around I

1056
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,519
could not find people in my area that

1057
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,519
were breeding that were making outdoor

1058
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:11,400
seeds and so for me I've always like I

1059
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,440
do indoor I love indoor but what I my

1060
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,280
passion is is the Outdoor the full term

1061
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,980
monsters so that's generally where my

1062
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,200
focus goes indoor you know just dial

1063
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,300
your rooms in but outdoor That's

1064
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,618
genetics that's what your plants can

1065
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,619
take

1066
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:30,059
so when I had that year when everything

1067
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,160
molded on me that I brought from

1068
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,199
California it was like okay well what am

1069
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,480
I going to run next year and then it was

1070
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:39,059
like well [ __ ] there's there's not much

1071
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,800
that I'm seeing so it was like research

1072
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:42,420
you know okay well this feed line has

1073
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,460
good you know if people have said okay

1074
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,800
well this does good in their climate in

1075
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,780
Canada or this you know oh they're this

1076
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,140
guy's breeding out in Maine or just you

1077
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,720
know it was like trying to find these

1078
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,819
these strains that I heard about that

1079
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,399
you know oh someone said it did good on

1080
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,500
mold resistance so I ran you know a [ __ ]

1081
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,619
ton of all these different lines trying

1082
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,300
to find okay well this one and this one

1083
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,300
okay and then it was okay well now I

1084
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,700
need to make seeds combine them

1085
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,980
and run them the next year and I mean

1086
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:16,500
that's pretty much how I started was was

1087
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,318
for myself like I

1088
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,460
I would have never predicted dragonflame

1089
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:23,818
genetics like I would have never

1090
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,639
predicted selling seeds or

1091
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:28,858
you know anyone even giving a [ __ ] about

1092
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,739
my seeds to be honest

1093
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:34,139
um so it was you know that's just where

1094
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:37,078
it developed and then you know word of

1095
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:39,779
mouth and you know people hear about it

1096
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,640
and you know I was at that time I was

1097
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,000
selling a lot of pounds that's pretty

1098
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:48,118
much what was paying for everything was

1099
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,760
um flour so it was

1100
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,599
you know just all of it combining really

1101
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,000
how DFG and breeding started

1102
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,800
oh yeah man what's been some of your

1103
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,800
favorite smokes that you didn't create

1104
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,618
oh

1105
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:10,200
um

1106
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:15,960
well I'm a sucker for a gray OG uh TK 92

1107
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:18,539
OG sfe the the the classics

1108
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,780
um death star is another one of you know

1109
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,779
one of my all-time favorites

1110
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,780
um

1111
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,220
the old Super Skunk cut I think that one

1112
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:34,078
comes to mind a lot but I think about

1113
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:36,480
um and then one of my buddies

1114
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,760
um Hemlock was what his handle was back

1115
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,679
in the old days on the forums

1116
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,839
um and he gave me a [ __ ] ton of seeds

1117
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:45,899
one of them was a dream Lotus Scentsy

1118
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:48,779
star and he called it Fubar and it's

1119
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,599
still to this day what in my mind what I

1120
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,480
compare everything potency wise to I

1121
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,160
mean True to this day still one of the

1122
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,900
most true one-hitter quitter I mean at

1123
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,940
that time I was moving pounds like crazy

1124
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,160
I was had a roommate we were both all we

1125
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,019
did was moved pounds and so we saw a

1126
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,539
[ __ ] ton of flower we were in Sacramento

1127
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,280
at that time so I saw a [ __ ] ton of

1128
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:10,800
California Flower really great flower

1129
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,900
and had access to it all the time and I

1130
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,359
remember rolling that joint and I I hit

1131
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,099
it and I handed it in to him and we were

1132
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,199
trying to play Call of Duty and we

1133
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,900
passed it back and forth and we both

1134
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,139
were both just going down into the

1135
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:29,519
[ __ ] chair dude why are we dying so

1136
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:31,078
much you know oh man yeah I mean and it

1137
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,719
was that was some I mean although

1138
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,000
honestly a lot of a lot of hemlock's

1139
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:37,559
lines had that were really phenomenal

1140
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,639
he's probably

1141
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:44,159
out of anyone unknown especially I mean

1142
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,618
if if he had marketed and branded

1143
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:50,159
himself he'd be he'd be a pillar in his

00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,519
passion forward in his work meticulous

1166
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:46,078
about sourcing and you know doing it

1167
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:49,619
right

1168
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,680
um he kind of has a bad rap for Rick for

1169
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:55,200
naming things but hazeman I've had a lot

1170
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,940
of great work out of Haven's lines but

1171
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,139
you know you kind of got to be careful

1172
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,179
about

1173
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:01,618
what's what sometimes

1174
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:03,358
um but he's you know he knows how to

1175
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,818
select males I'll say that for sure he

1176
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,039
knows how the plant works and how to how

1177
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:09,539
to make nice lines

1178
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:13,739
um

1179
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:16,380
the um Lucky Dog Seed Co is one that

1180
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,118
I've you know I'm like digging through

1181
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,619
their packs and I'm going to be digging

1182
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,980
through more of their packs looking for

1183
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:26,099
some of the old school chem type stuff

1184
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:29,099
um El Jefe is great as well old school

1185
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,760
you know old school guy

1186
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,500
um

1187
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,020
but I mean I think I think it's pretty

1188
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,579
much for me it's the people that that I

1189
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:39,559
gravitate to are people that are doing

1190
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,560
it for the passion of the plant not for

1191
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:50,880
and the people that don't you see it you

1192
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,619
see it real quick yep they might wear a

1193
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,260
mask for a year or two and then boom

1194
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:59,180
it's out there

1195
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,180
it's funny I've always heard the saying

1196
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:04,500
if there's a test of a strain but time

1197
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,539
is a test of a breeder and you know

1198
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,420
you're around long enough your

1199
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:11,818
reputation comes out you know who who

1200
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,039
you are what your standards are what you

1201
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:15,779
are putting out into the world

1202
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:19,139
you can't hide that [ __ ] forever people

1203
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:22,700
figure it out exactly so what have you

1204
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:22,699
been smoking on the most lately

1205
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:28,679
um so I picked up uh from can Essentials

1206
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:32,279
I grabbed a uh half I think of the

1207
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:33,838
modified macberry when we first landed

1208
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,359
um so I've been smoking mostly on that

1209
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,880
and then going to the dispensary right

1210
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:41,159
now now sadly

1211
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,500
um you know just grabbing what I can

1212
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:47,399
find that looks decent enough

1213
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:51,659
um and I have my first cycle coming down

1214

1215
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:57,118
homegrown oh I'm so looking forward to

1219
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,818

no they I you know it's funny it's one

1238
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,940
of those things it's so surreal to go

1239
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,318
into a shop and see something that you

1240
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,900
made on the Shelf

1241
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:54,179
but to see something that like they grow

1242
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,680
with love in their plan and you can like

1243
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,078
ride toward their Farm

1244
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,000
I've been to a lot of [ __ ] show Rec

1245
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,940
facilities let me [ __ ] say that I've

1246
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,219
been to a lot of them I don't vouch for

1247
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,500
very many like I can count on one hand

1248
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:08,879
how many I will vouch for and they are

1249
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,679
one of them

1250
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,519
um everything I've grabbed from them has

1251
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,279
been

1252
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,838
you know truly truly done well and so

1253
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,519
it's really awesome to see someone

1254
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,500
that's I mean they're filling

1255
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,539
greenhouses with that cut so it's it's

1256
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,920
really cool to see someone that's you

1257
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:24,358
know using one of my strains that does

1258
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,599
it right that's always such a great

1259
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:26,598
feeling

1260
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,339
do you mind uh mind sharing a Horror

1261
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:31,338
Story

1262
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:37,019
um I think the biggest one that I my

1263
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:39,598
wife and I still laugh about

1264
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:41,639
um he was down in Grants Pass

1265
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,859
and it was one of those facilities when

1266
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,299
I walked in my wife and I looked at each

1267
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:48,299
other and we like

1268
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:50,760
what could we do with this [ __ ] spot

1269
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,380
like it was gorgeous so it was right on

1270
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,180
the river and they had I mean it was

1271
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,559
probably 50 acres

1272
00:50:54,179 --> 00:51:00,598
and they had this crazy like octagon

1273
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:03,540
two-story building and then on one side

1274
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,300
they had huge warehouse space and then

1275
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:08,639
right in front it was like picturesque

1276
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,619
next to the river they had a they had

1277
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:14,039
the permit to do a tier two here in

1278
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:16,380
Oregon and I came down in the Consulting

1279
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:19,019
row to try to help save their grow is

1280
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:22,500
basically what my

1281
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:24,599
um meeting was for and I got there and

1282
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,400
they had I think they had nine Growers

1283
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,280
working there

1284
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,338
and my wife she's not a grower

1285
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,440
um she's a nurse she came with me and

1286
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:36,299
sure her not being the grower she's just

1287
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,338
exposed to it because of me she walked

1288
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,339
into their warehouse and was like what

1289
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:44,279
the [ __ ] are you guys doing and they had

1290
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:47,039
literally every pest they had russet

1291
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:50,640
they had rude aphids they had PM they

1292
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:53,460
had them all they had shelves of avid

1293
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,679
they had shelf of Eagle 20 and four bed

1294
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:00,000
and everything you're not supposed to be

1295
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,919
[ __ ] doing yeah I mean hundreds of

1296
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,358
lights in their warehouse and this was

1297
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,338
like mid-june July so in my mind my

1298
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:10,199
plants at that time were four foot tall

1299
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:13,558
already so I'm going to this Rec Space

1300
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,838
I'm expecting to see a field of [ __ ]

1301
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:18,059
plants they have anything planted yet

1302
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,739
and they were making I think they said

1303
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:22,500
like twelve thousand dollars was what

1304
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:23,639
each grower was making a month there and

1305
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,019
I straight up looked at all of them and

1306
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,019
I was like y'all [ __ ] robbing this

1307
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,338
guy because their Garden was I mean

1308
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:32,099
straight up everything you weren't

1309
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:35,159
supposed to be doing and the the owner

1310
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:38,880
was here and he had been in a motorcycle

1311
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:40,199
accident or something and he literally

1312
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,818
pulled out his bike and then right in

1313
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,618
front of my wife and I and started like

1314
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:45,420
crushing it up and snorting it and

1315
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,280
looked at her and well you're a nurse

1316
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,920
you should be okay with this and we're

1317
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,859
like dude you're [ __ ] crazy like no

1318
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,619
you're like and then he got a call from

1319
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:57,598
a dispensary that they were like are we

1320
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:59,160
need those clones that you promised us

1321
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,480
and he was like oh yeah I'll bring him

1322
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:02,159
down I got some moms for you and I

1323
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,260
looked at him I was like I just told you

1324
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,440
all of those plants should be [ __ ]

1325
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,240
burned like start over just burn them

1326
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,858
like they are not they're [ __ ]

1327
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,799
infested and you've been using every

1328
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:15,960
chemical so now they're they're [ __ ]

1329
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,059
immune to Avid like you're not gonna go

1330
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,220
put that on a [ __ ] shelf to give to

1331
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:22,019
patients this was in the you know very

1332
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:24,358
early days of wreck when they still had

1333
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:25,619
medical like you could go to the

1334
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:27,719
dispensary and if you were a medical

1335
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:31,800
patient you might be buying that flower

1336
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:34,318
sprayed with [ __ ] Avid and I was like

1337
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,420
oh man I was it still pisses me off to

1338
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,800
this day and he did I mean he ended up

1339
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,800
taking those [ __ ] cuts to The

1340
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,920
Dispensary to put on the Shelf [ __ ]

1341
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,859
russet mites rude aphids braid with

1342
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,720
[ __ ] everything and

1343
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:50,159
obviously I didn't end up taking the job

1344
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,618
because if you're going to be that like

1345
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:55,139
that's your morals when you can go [ __ ]

1346
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:58,318
yourself is how I feel no [ __ ]

1347
00:53:55,139 --> 00:54:00,779
those russets man just those alone are a

1348
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,920
[ __ ] nightmare rude aphids on top of

1349
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,900
it

1350
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,019
oh I'll tell you it's an insane story

1351
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,119
man yeah I'd take rough it might any day

1352
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,980
over the week over rude aphids rude

1353
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,660
aphids are like there I've never had

1354
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:17,460
married Avis so I can

1355
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:19,699
and I will never [ __ ] forget it like

1356
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,260
oh man [ __ ] those pets

1357
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:24,118
and you had the russets too

1358
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,579
oh I've had Restless a few times over

1359
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,119
the years russets are he used wettable

1360
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:31,260
sulfur pretty easy to knock out russets

1361
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:33,660
um you know those

1362
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,460
for a while they were really a pain in

1363
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:37,980
the ass but once once figured out

1364
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,119
wettable sulfur they're pretty easy to

1365
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,420
get rid of

1366
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,119
so I feel that every one of these

1367
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,700
obstacles that you face in agriculture

1368
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,220
is a learning experience because once

1369
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:52,019
it's happened it's already there you

1370
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:53,578
might as well learn from it instead of

1371
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:55,440
getting into that State of Mind where

1372
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:58,318
you're just crushed and upset about it

1373
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,720
you know and just kind of giving up it

1374
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,818
everything happens for a reason and that

1375
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,679
builds that knowledge of how to deal

1376
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:05,759
with that Pest of how to deal with that

1377
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:09,598
situation

1378
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,940
so when I first got russets I did not

1379
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,740
take it seriously I took it like most

1380
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,179
pets that I have met up there we're

1381
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:16,919
gonna try a few different things we're

1382
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,799
going to start with like you know the

1383
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,659
lowest chance and uh kind of build up to

1384
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,579
it I've already lost this crop I'm not

1385
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:26,159
okay with flowering these out you know

1386
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:27,720
they're damaged they're stressed out so

1387
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,058
we might as well see what works on these

1388
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,980
[ __ ] so I actually kept the russets

1389
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:35,339
around in an indoor environment for like

1390
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:37,619
six months it was [ __ ] because a lot

1391
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:40,318
of the lower end products like your your

1392
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,940
natural like uh insecticidal soap and

1393
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,880
[ __ ] like that they weren't really doing

1394
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,800
anything to it and uh yeah if you don't

1395
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,500
kill them with that they do become

1396
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,359
immune to it they burrow into your stems

1397
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,500
some of them won't even get touched by

1398
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,679
it you know

1399
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,539
so the only thing I found at the end was

1400
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,519
heating up my room because that was kind

1401
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:02,159
of keeping them out of the out of the

1402
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,858
stocks and the stems of the Clones

1403
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:07,139
and then using that wettable sulfur and

1404
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:09,119
spraying that down and you got to be

1405
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:11,759
consistent with it but yes it's not that

1406
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:14,280
hard it's just a matter of uh

1407
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,680
work ethic and consistency being on top

1408
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,660
of them for sure yeah oh that's that's

1409
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:20,219
farming 100

1410
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:21,899
um there's no replacement for the

1411
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:23,939
gardener Shadow I mean that's the way it

1412
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,099
is the more work you put into it the

1413
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,619
better your crop is I had one guy that

1414
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,359
he had multiple tents in his in his

1415
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,318
warehouse and he had spider mites like

1416
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:35,460
crazy

1417
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:36,779
and so his garage was like hoarded and I

1418
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,940
kept telling him you were never gonna

1419
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,339
get rid of spider mites until you clean

1420
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,858
this garage out because you might spray

1421
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:46,380
your tent they're in all of that right

1422
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:48,838
there behind you too and he had his dogs

1423
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,858
that would come through his grow and I

1424
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,440
was like

1425
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:54,719
until you keep your pets out of the grow

1426
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,760
you're like they are bringing them in

1427
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,739
and out they're not in this Barn anymore

1428
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,079
they're on your property they're on the

1429
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:03,838
trail that every Trail your dog takes

1430
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:05,160
they are on just waiting

1431
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,578
um but that's I mean that's the way

1432
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,199
farming is is yes I mean I know a lot of

1433
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:11,880
Growers that let their animals into

1434
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,939
their growing it gives me a heart attack

1435
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,800
every single time I mean yeah like you

1436
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,539
said especially with dogs that are

1437
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,460
running around outside and aren't house

1438
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:22,380
dogs you know and you're not regularly

1439
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,358
washing them or you just took them for a

1440
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:27,059
walk they've got [ __ ] there's gonna be

1441
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:29,818
[ __ ] even if it's just dust mites you're

1442
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:31,079
gonna have a problem yeah yeah I mean

1443
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:33,179
it's something that I struggle with too

1444
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,380
I mean I have I have animals that are

1445
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:36,118
part of the family

1446
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,579
um so I get it

1447
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:41,338
um you know and I you know I've been a

1448
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:42,359
hippie Outlaw like I the idea of wearing

1449
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:45,239
like lab

1450
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:47,578
suit type stuff doesn't really Vibe with

1451
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,299
the idea of a garden

1452
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,460
um

1453
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:53,880
but especially indoor I mean just my

1454
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,559
logo man yeah

1455
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,000
on the indoor

1456
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,460
actually

1457
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,460
because is is everything

1458
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:05,460
um clean rooms are much much much easier

1459
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,079
to maintain and you know the cleaner you

1460
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,460
can keep it the less problems you

1461
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,859
generally will have

1462
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,358
is that part of your sop going into your

1463
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:15,420
grow

1464
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:18,179
uh most of the time yeah I and I try not

1465
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,619
to wear the same clothes I don't do the

1466
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:22,078
lab coat

1467
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:26,519
um I probably should

1468
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:29,519
um yeah I I don't go that far but I do

1469
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,639
go in with clean clothes and um I never

1470
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:34,858
go from one to the next it's like if I

1471
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,480
go if I work in this Garden I don't wear

1472
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:38,098
those same clothes I go take those

1473
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,980
clothes off I take a shower before I go

1474
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,539
into another Garden just not only for

1475
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,880
the pests but also because I work with

1476
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:46,619
pollen that I don't want to take pollen

1477
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,720
where I don't want pollen to be

1478
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:51,298
um and it's so easy to do that so it's

1479
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,219
you know it's all just part of part of

1480
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:54,659
what you just have to do to do it you

1481
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:58,019
know really well

1482
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:02,420
yeah absolutely so what would be one of

1483
00:58:58,019 --> 00:59:02,420
your best tips for beginner grower

1484
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,980
oh man

1485
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,920
um

1486
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:12,599
well I think when I was a new grower I

1487
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,019
think what I tended to do was over love

1488
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:18,720
the plant and over overdo it like it's

1489
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:21,420
so easy to over water it's so easy to

1490
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,098
over love when you're when you're first

1491
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,780
learning

1492
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:28,079
um and so I'd say that's probably

1493
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,880
probably the the biggest thing is to

1494
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,740
start learn like the biggest process

1495
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,039
about growing I'd say is learning to

1496
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:38,159
read plants learning to understand

1497
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,659
is what what they want what they look

1498
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,399
like when they're not getting what they

1499
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:44,578
want and how to fix it I mean I think

1500
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,220
those are that's the underlying key for

1501
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:48,960
for success I would say the faster you

1502
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:51,899
can learn to read plants

1503
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,519
you know the the better the better adapt

1504
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,200
you will because happy plants make Happy

1505
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,940
Flowers that's just the way it is stress

1506
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,598
plants you're not going to get what you

1507
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:02,039
want out of a stress plant exactly

1508
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:05,280
definitely a good tip right there over

1509
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:08,099
watering is probably the biggest problem

1510
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,920
with most beginner new Growers

1511
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:13,619
um and over loving like though more

1512
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,019
water does not equal faster growth nope

1513
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:20,880
it's all about those dry down times and

1514
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:23,519
cons or consistent uh water so great tip

1515
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,798
on that thank you for everybody coming

1516

that are going head-to-head they get a

1536
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,700
pick which packs they want right off the

1537

01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:04,139
um so Larry Livermore was the uh guy who

1560
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:07,139
found Green Day the drummer for Green

1561
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:10,199
Day and it's basically uh his story

1562
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:13,139
living on Spy Rock in Mendo uh during

1563
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:15,838
the prohibition area era I it's it's a

1564
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:17,639
book I love I got a ton of them

1570
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,159

1571
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:31,440
say the winner of do or dab whoever wins

1572
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:32,699

1574
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:37,259
from Larry Livermore that's [ __ ]

1575
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:40,259
badass man how'd you come across that

1576
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,599
big Green Day fan

1577
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,640
um no not really actually

1578
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:49,200
um but I am

1579
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:52,318
um so we did a season in Mendocino

1580
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,199
um on pigeon Ridge in uh it's outside of

1581
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:58,259
kovalo which is

1582
01:02:54,199 --> 01:03:01,318
Outlaw uh grow country basically

1583
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:06,079
um murder mountain-esque but it's in

1584
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:09,838
Mendo not Humboldt and so spyrock is

1585
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:15,298
the if if the Emerald Triangle is the

1586
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:17,338
epicenter of cannabis spyrock is what I

1587
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:20,219
would consider the epicenter of the

1588
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:23,159
Emerald Triangle it was

1589
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:25,439
um in the height of prohibition you were

1590
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:28,019
invite only

1591
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,420
um there was armed guards blocking

1592
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:32,420
spyrock you did not go there if you were

1593
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,400
not a grower and if you were not invited

1594
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:38,220
so it's you know Outlaw country

1595
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,838
basically that where this really you

1596
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:42,000
know where this movement that you know

1597
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:45,358
we're all a part of now

1598
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,219
you know I would say was the heart of it

1599
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,139
um so I mean it's it's something I've

1600
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,279
always it's always fascinated me that

1601
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:52,798
area

1602
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,900
um you know especially especially the

1603
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,099
year that I was there hearing the OG

1604
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,920
Tales

1605
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,720

1606
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,220

everything in

1608
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:07,318
um you know really far into the into the

1609
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:10,199
Into the Wilderness to to grow this

1610
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:12,719
plant and how spoiled we all are now to

1611

1612
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,399

1613
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:19,618
