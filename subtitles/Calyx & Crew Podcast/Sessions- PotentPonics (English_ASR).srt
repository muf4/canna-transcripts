the man himself Steve raisner who is

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,840
very well known for large scale farming

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,480
aquaponics natural farming and growing

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
in a ton of different areas all around

12
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,119
the world how are you doing

the morning here in Thailand how are you

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,359
doing pretty good man it's a little bit

16
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,759
later for us I know it's a little bit

17
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,440
rough for you like we' mentioned before

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,478
I think you and I had kind of the same

19
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,239
night last night what were you out

20
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:08,560
doing I was just hanging out with a good

21
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,679
friend of mine who's a a female TIE

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,719
fighter and uh we had a fun evening so

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,880
oh wow cool she um so I wanted to ask

24
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,478
you you know you just got back from the

25
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,640
you did the canx Asia cup yep in which

26
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,400
you got a judge did you find anything

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,359
special when you guys were going through

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,079
that actually I was just funny enough I

29
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,879
was just looking at the entries actually

30
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,839
have a lot of the original testers still

31
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,879
here but the one that won that I thought

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,439
was really interesting and this one had

33
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:43,399
like really different notes to it was

34
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,679
this uh Apes in

35
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,640
space and this was the one that won the

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,600
cup and this is Apes in Space by Kamar

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,519
Taz is the name of the farm so it was

38
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,399
nice to see a lot of really nice uh you

39
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,718
know premium quality stuff that's been

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,879
Tha grown you know a lot of people in

41
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,359
Thailand have been complaining about

42
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,798
about the Imports but you know there's a

43
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,478
lot of Thai people that are producing

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,960
stuff that you know you wouldn't know

45
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,399
the difference between that and someone

46
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,399
in Cali you know they're producing

47
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,080
really good fire I would say five to s%

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,318
of the people here really know what

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
they're doing and can really dial in

50
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,839
their stuff the same way you can in the

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,000
west and then the rest of it is like you

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
know might as well be Oklahoma and and

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,878
you know just everyone that could get a

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,800
license grew and uh you know grabbed the

55
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,439
seeds from their sock drawer and threw

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,239
them in and whatever happened happened

57
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,800
and it's been funny to see a bunch of

58
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,000
the the Thai Farmers be like I'm going

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,000
to grow watermelons again next year that

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,519
didn't work out for me and it was like

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,039
well that totally could have if you just

62
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,519
went and got some genetics that work

63
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,359
from your local Village and no

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,599
disrespect to the tie stuff but of we've

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,959
popped about 60 different tie strains so

66
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:51,238
far and only two of them I think have

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
any kind of commercial value um not to

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,959
say that some of the other ones don't

69
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,318
have some unique tur Bean profiles or

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
this that or the other but nothing

71
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,399
that's going to be any kind of viable

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
you know the the simply the bun

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,280
structure on a lot of the LA the

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Cambodian and the Thai stuff is just to

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,719
the point where you know I could grow a

76
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,878
six foot plant but I'm only going to get

77
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,959
maybe you know a QP off of it or or you

78
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,598
know maybe half a pound because there's

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,878
just no bud structure on all the buds

80
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,119
are are super super small so that's been

81
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,959
one of the biggest things we have found

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,680
a couple of cool ones um one or two

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,439
coffee ties one or two chocolate ties uh

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
and then the one that I it's my favorite

85
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,639
by far of all the tie stuff we found was

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,878
the stuff that canai seeds found he

87
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,719
found this

88
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,239
um we call it Temple tii or taii Buddha

89
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,479
massive but these came off of these 24

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
20 24 foot tall plants they smell like

91
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,039
peaches and they're just like these

92
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,518
gigantic like it almost looks like

93
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,239
something out of like NorCal or Southern

94
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,480
orig again these gigantic enormous

95
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,519
plants but they grow that way under 1212

96
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,438
like they they're not even like like

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
they just get to be like 20 feet tall

98
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:58,719
and then flip it it's the craziest thing

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,519
and the Vigor on those plants from seed

100
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,598
uh on week eight they're already pushing

101
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,599
11 feet from seed right like and and

102
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,759
then they talking good node spacing you

103
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,719
know bushy good density like barely need

104
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,239
any pruning and they're just bushing out

105
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,158
like I've never seen a plant that grows

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,798
like that ever anywhere and I've been to

107
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,120
Africa Jamaica like South America all

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,599
over and I've never seen a plant that

109
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,280
has Vigor like that even the seeds on

110
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,600
that one looked abnormally

111
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,119
big yeah they're literally four times

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,160
the size of any other cannabis plant

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
I've ever seen before and that includes

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,280
some of the larer ones of SE out

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,879
west I know we were talking earlier that

116
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:39,119
you said you had gone through thousands

117
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,279
of taii seeds and found very few that

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,918
were worth uh cultivating was it Norm

119
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,000
was it just the bud structure alone or

120
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,478
was it the yield or what what was

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,720
special about those few that you did

122
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:54,478
keep so the the the Buddha taii the

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
Vigor on it and there's the speed of

124
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,758
growth and there's the potential you

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,160
could cross that with you know anything

126
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,479
and it's going to you know you're going

127
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,439
to get some something cool out of it you

128
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,038
know that's going to have Vigor that's

129
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,719
unparalleled um I don't think it's very

130
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,639
good for indoor grows but for outdoor

131
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,520
man that Gene that genetic pool is going

132
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,600
to add a lot of nice stuff to a lot of

133
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,959
people's work and it kind of revives

134
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,280
some of that Vigor I think a lot of

135
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,560
people that have if they're if you're on

136
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,959
like an F12 or an F14 you might have

137
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,959
lost a little Vigor or you know even F6

138
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,839
or F7 you might have lost a little Vigor

139
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,799
on your on your beans but you cross back

140
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,198
cross it with that to get them giant

141
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
again like you're certainly going to

142
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,919
find some gems in there so I'm excited

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
to get that back out to the to the

144
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,079
states and all you know kind of see what

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,240
people can kind of create with that

146
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,839
because it's like I said I I've been

147
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,360
around for a long time and I haven't

148
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,879
seen anything quite the way that that

149
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,680
plant does um uh but uh as far as the

150
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,240
other ones some of the sandalwood turps

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
have been pretty interesting and finding

152
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,319
some of those really funky like just

153
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,160
more poper it almost smells like some of

154
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,039
the Poes my mom used to make when I was

155
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,240
a kid and not not anything like cannabis

156
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,199
so that's been pretty strange um other

157
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,960
than that I would say like 75% of the

158
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,759
country is just lemoning dominant like

159
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,279
stuff that you guys already have right

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,639
like how many lemon strains do you guys

161
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,519
have in the states a lot right so it's

162
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,160
another lemoning strain that doesn't

163
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,359
have anything else really unique to it

164
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,120
that doesn't yield well we have plenty

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,960
of those we talked about that a couple

166
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,160
podcasts ago I said I've had so much

167
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,000
lemon [ __ ] at this point like it's got

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,680
to be something original about it or

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,598
spectacular like a different a lemon

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,038
that doesn't follow that typical like

171
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:33,680
sour Bland l lemine thing you know it's

172
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,159
got to be like a super sugary sweet

173
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,478
lemon or something different to impress

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
me because it just kind of gets

175
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,318
convoluted and they all kind of get

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,199
really similar you know like a lemon

177
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,919
skunk is a Lemon Haze is a

178
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,439
lemon but I know that you said you gone

179
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,279
through a ton of different uh genetics

180
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,719
and you were finding some really crazy

181
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,478
[ __ ] like you posted that one up that

182
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,759
was a Herm but it had hered different

183
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,038
Sexes on different branches of the same

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,319
plant uh you also posted about that

185
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,878
crazy ass one that had no serration and

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,800
was just completely smooth Leaf after

187
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,199
going through all these different

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,478
genetics uh what else have you found

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,478
that has blown your mind that you have

190
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,478
not seen before in other places um and

191
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,159
maybe even something that you might want

192
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,199
to breed forward

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,479
with um definitely that non- serrated

194
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,879
plant that's the only time I've ever

195
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,959
seen that and I've I've popped a lot of

196
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,400
plants uh I've been doing this for quite

197
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,959
a long time and I don't know and I

198
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,478
message other people I only know one

199
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,638
other person that managed to find it

200
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,598
actually two take it back two other

201
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,960
people that I've ever seen it before but

202
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,918
someone told me it's from like the

203
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,638
highlands of Indonesia like some of the

204
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,198
Indonesian Highland stuff is like that

205
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,000
um and that that's probably where it

206
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,158
came from um I was told that the strain

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,079
came from originally Northern Thailand

208
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,680
now that I know that from two other

209
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,719
people that it's probably came from

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Cambodia or Indonesia um just because of

211
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,960
that that trait U but it could just be a

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,680
mutation

213
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,038
but that's the I've only seen that one

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,720
time and I've seen plenty of other you

215
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,439
know freak Show mutations and other

216
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,759
mutations just kind of pop up we even

217
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,199
have a blue bll SoDo that almost looks

218
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,919
like a freak Show and it has no freak

219
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,478
Show genetics in it whatsoever and it's

220
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,359
almost that same Leaf expression so um

221
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,478
that kind of stuff while rare is isn't

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,479
unheard of um but that like you were

223
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,000
saying the the male female branches on

224
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,240
some of those terms that that's pretty

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,439
common on on tropical stuff but you

226
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,079
don't see it on like Northern photos

227
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,360
hardly ever but on a lot of the like

228
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,278
Thai stuff or col some of the Colombian

229
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,360
stuff or some of the African stuff if

230
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,038
it's really dialed into the the tropical

231
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,440
light settings for whatever reason it

232
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,240
seems to to increase that but we've also

233
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,279
been like root binding the uh you know

234
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,039
only putting the the testers into like

235
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,278
two three gallon pots to try and force

236
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,958
root stress we've been flowering them

237
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,200
out in 107 degree heat like we're trying

238
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,199
to find you know push the plants be like

239
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,440
okay you're going to Herm Herm and show

240
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,680
me that you're going to do that so that

241
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
we can get rid of you you know what I

242
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,399
mean it's part of the testing process

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,278
when you're pheno hunting is punishing

244
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,200
the testers a little bit so you can you

245
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,799
know kind of sift out the stuff that's

246
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,839
weak one of our patreon members dank

247
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,838
magician wants to know is that exotic

248
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,040
genetics Apes in

249
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,839
space I don't know uh is the honest

250
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,360
question it was just one the name of the

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,959
stream the the top five were divine

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,959
storm apes and

253
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:31,120
space things

254
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,120
here um

255
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,199
Divine

256
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:39,000
[Music]

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,720
storm the apples and banana

258
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,958
and I smoked the other two the purple

259
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,040
purple

260
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,399
Majestic yeah I smoked all that one yeah

261
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,319
that was the other one the purple

262
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,759
Majestic actually was one of the most

263
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,720
unique ones because the purple Majestic

264
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,000
actually had some um clove TPS and I've

265
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,839
only had clove TPS uh in cannabis maybe

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,639
three or four times where smells almost

267
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,519
smelled like you mixed a jarum like

268
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,919
jarum black remember the Black

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,879
cigarettes the cloes yeah it smells like

270
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,479
you took one of those and and crumbled a

271
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,838
little bit through the bud even though

272
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,278
it's just the bud flavor so that was

273
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,880
really interesting just from in terms of

274
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,720
uniqueness I haven't had that before or

275
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,600
at least a purple stram I don't think

276
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,160
I've ever had like clove more of the POI

277
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,320
like you were saying earlier for sure

278
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,919
like a spicy flal thing I can't say I've

279
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,240
come across clove that's pretty damn

280
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:33,078
cool uh since we were on the topic of

281
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,519
land races you and I had talked earlier

282
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:39,159
um me coming from a place where I really

283
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,519
respect and love cultivating land R

284
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,360
seeds knowing myself that most of them

285
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,159
are going to be [ __ ] and it's going to

286
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,919
be a heavy coal process I just find

287
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,120
something special in finding that one in

288
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,199
a million you know uh it's something

289
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,360
unique that nobody has it's entirely

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,879
your own and you can proliferate on that

291
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,200
you said a lot of these genetics are

292
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:03,838
contaminated nowadays um and some of the

293
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,639
best stuff is coming from Africa why do

294
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,480
you feel that

295
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,278
way so Africa especially Zimbabwe mosan

296
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,440
Beek and some of the other areas have

297
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,679
been so War torn or had other political

298
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,399
issues that there was no commercial

299
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,719
production for export right um uh Sudan

300
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,559
like any of the areas that have been

301
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,240
really rough in Africa who's going to go

302
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,638
in there and bring in a bunch of Western

303
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,440
genetics to grow and Export nobody right

304
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,000
that there's no economic benefit to it

305
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,560
because Logistics are too impossible so

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,320
those are the places that I've found

307
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:42,039
that actually have true real land race

308
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,639
left was in Zimbabwe and mosm Beek and

309
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,000
it's the only place I've seen it even in

310
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,039
East stini um what you um swasiland is

311
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,078
what most of your listeners probably

312
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,078
know it as they just changed the name

313
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,679
not long ago for those of you that don't

314
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,439
know um they even they like were I don't

315
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,120
think I saw any land race there it was

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,320
all contaminated because they've been

317
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,039
exporting for so long as the primary

318
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,519
economic source of or primary income

319
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,679
Source there for those people that of

320
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,200
course they're going to in you know

321
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,759
bring in some better yielding genetics

322
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
you would if you're a poor Farmer in the

323
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,198
middle of bumble [ __ ] trying to feed his

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,720
family right like that makes total sense

325
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,519
like I can't even knock the guy right

326
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,720
like that totally like please man feed

327
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,919
your children but at the same time like

328
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
we're trying to find these these rare

329
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,479
genetics that haven't been messed with

330
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,519
yet but Jamaica's been basically

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,278
completely contaminated and has been as

332
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,720
far as I'm aware since 2016 you might

333
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
have a couple rostas that have been

334
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,278
preserving stuff here and there but most

335
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,320
of the island I've been Eastern side

336
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,360
western side all around and it's all

337
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,440
basically just been flooded with Western

338
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,000
genetics at this point but in Africa in

339
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,839
Zimbabwe you know here to many rastas or

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,399
Stoners going to Zimbabwe for seed

341
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,120
hunting right like it's just uh it's not

342
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,839
known for that but there's some

343
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,360
incredible pinee dominant sativas there

344
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,440
and some stuff that is just real Great

345
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,440
Smoke and really unique and it's it's

346
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,279
not being persecuted the same way yeah

347
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
weed's illegal there but like you know

348
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:09,480
they're not unless you like are being

349
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,239
real blatant and stupid about it you're

350
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,879
selling to school children they're not

351
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,879
really that big a deal you know and it's

352
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,919
more tolerated than it is you know

353
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:21,799
anything else let talk about okay before

354
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,759
we move on to that actually um you're

355
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,559
saying most of these land races are

356
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,799
contaminated now how do you feel about

357
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,359
the land races around Thailand there's

358
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,359
such a diverse group group throughout

359
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,360
the country um like what are we looking

360
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,680
at like 50% maybe of the country might

361
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,159
still hold land race or is it pretty

362
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,399
hard to Thailand Thailand has a lot of

363
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,958
land race but I think in the next year

364
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,320
that's about to disappear because of all

365
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,518
the pollen floating around in the

366
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,639
country but um so what's interesting

367
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,159
about the tii stuff is so you have the

368
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,959
lowland stuff so anywhere where there's

369
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:56,759
rice fields or the lowland wetter areas

370
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,239
seem to almost be all lemony dominant

371
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,079
and then when we get into the mountains

372
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,519
and the Hills like when I go up to calco

373
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,278
and stuff like that then I start to run

374
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,198
into a lot more of the mango dominant in

375
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,120
the in the forest and like where the

376
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,159
trees are and all that in the Hills

377
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
seems to be almost exclusively mango

378
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,600
dominant and then when you get up to

379
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,560
changai or close to changai you start to

380
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,800
get some of the weirder Himalayan

381
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,518
genetics and some of the sandalwood tpps

382
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,439
and some of the chocolate TPS and some

383
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
of the weirder coffee turs and some of

384
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,120
the funkier stuff like which eat and

385
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,278
north of there um so it kind of seems

386
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,759
like it's very very region and climate

387
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:34,639
specific and and you can definitely tell

388
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,480
that they're honing in on okay it's

389
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,480
trying to stop this this or this uh and

390
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,399
whatever so um that uh definitely seems

391
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,720
to be very region specific and I can

392
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,078
almost smell it and tell you roughly you

393
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,320
know I can't tell you what city it's

394
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,439
from but I can tell you what climate

395
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,000
it's from in Thailand and again that's

396
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,480
having gone around about 60 different

397
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,078
farms and smelled quite a bit of

398
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,199
different stuff so what about the

399
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,519
esteemed blue tie and those blueberry

400
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,439
TPS have you come across that

401
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,839
yet no I have not found anything Berry

402
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
blueberry I found some tropical fruity

403
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,519
stuff but nothing that it was more like

404
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,680
strawberry or like like candy banana

405
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,278
than it was uh nothing on the on the

406
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,278
blueberry or Berry end at all uh not in

407
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,320
terms of

408
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:24,078
TAA we were talking about Acceptance in

409
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,320
the country around there how has

410
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,838
Thailand changed post or pre-

411
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,319
legalization versus Po po legalization I

412
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,360
always assumed that Thailand for an

413
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:38,000
Asiatic country was one of the more

414
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,879
accepting areas um for cannabis use and

415
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,839
cannabis

416
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,519
history well I used to get a caning and

417
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,759
depending on how much you had you could

418
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,759
uh you could get even a more severe

419
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:54,159
punishment really but um oh yeah yeah um

420
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,879
in fact like just want to say some of

421
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,078
our neighbors are still pretty Draconian

422
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,399
I mean [ __ ] Indonesia just hanged a guy

423
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,439
yesterday

424
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,759
Indonesia I did see that isn't Vietnam

425
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,279
pretty bad too Vietnam and Cambodia are

426
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,879
very chill I know plenty of people

427
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,838
growing over there that are uh not

428
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,078
having issues like it's very tolerated

429
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
let me put it that way and a lot of the

430
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,679
Thai stuff is ending up over there let

431
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,360
me put it that

432
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:22,318
way um but uh it's interesting that you

433
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,560
bring this topic up because in seven

434
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:29,240
days from now this whole industry could

435
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:32,239
end here um the uh elections are coming

436
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,198
uh next Sunday 7 days from now and

437
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,318
depending on which party wins the party

438
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,359
that's most likely to win is extremely

439
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,879
anti-cannabis they want to roll it back

440
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,399
to drug status and make it a medical

441
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,278
program only uh and basically sell it

442
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,879
through universities and hospitals um

443
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,480
which would pull the rug out from the

444
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,879
entire industry here um they could

445
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,360
possibly have a

446
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,799
medical uh card for to for ties I would

447
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,879
imagine that would be yearly or a

448
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,359
one-time thing for tie people and then

449
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,799
tourists I would imagine they're going

450
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,519
to have a 30-day card or a 45 Day card

451
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,038
or some [ __ ] like that um but that

452
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,838
that's what it's looking like it could

453
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,720
be but they could just repeal it and

454
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,359
arrest everyone like we don't know but

455
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,798
you have 24 hours from the time it's

456
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,119
published in The Royal Gazette so if

457
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,078
they pass it got 24 hours to get the

458
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:21,159
[ __ ] out so um that could absolutely

459
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,838
happen next week so uh in fact I've been

460
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,000
uh working on some some backup plans in

461
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,240
case of the the event on that so uh you

462
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,679
you know everybody in this country is

463
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,160
very nervous about what's going to

464
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,360
happen there's a lot of money pumped

465
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,519
into the economy here and then also too

466
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:39,479
like it would screw a lot of tie people

467
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,400
over if they did that I mean [ __ ] the

468
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,679
the the farm here in where I am they

469
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,880
hire uh you know 20 to 30 local ties

470
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,919
every single week on you most of them on

471
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,840
a on a five to six day a week basis

472
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,038
right all those people would lose their

473
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,279
jobs and those people did not have high

474
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,558
you know decent paying jobs before

475
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,639
cannabis got started they weren't

476
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:00,678
getting paid what we're paying paying

477
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
them out here in the middle of bumble

478
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,280
[ __ ] in the rice fields they were

479
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,158
getting paid whatever they got made off

480
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,399
the rice like the completely different

481
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,799
income level so it's allowed a ton of

482
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,679
money to come into a lot of these more

483
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,000
remote parts of Thailand they would have

484
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,919
never seen income investment that was

485
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,880
even a tenth of the scale of what's

486
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,600
what's been pumped into these Villages

487
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,440
and I think a lot of the villagers now

488
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,079
are like yo we don't really like weed

489
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,679
but this guy has brought a ton of money

490
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,720
into the restaurant and the lady that

491
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,720
the housekeepers and the all these other

492
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,798
things that that you know end up

493
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,558
benefiting The Village financially and

494
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,679
buying the local fish from the market

495
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,319
and like all those and the the mechanic

496
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,240
that fixes the trucks and the guy that

497
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,359
fixes the scooters and the gas station

498
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,919
and all these people end up financially

499
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,479
benefiting from it and I think that they

500
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,960
didn't really realized that until they

501
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,919
had a chance

502
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,919
to um you know actually have a

503
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,120
full-blown market and kind of see how it

504
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,880
all played out and how people got got

505
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,839
hired and how that money kind of

506
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,200
trickled down through the economy um

507
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,119
again in general once you have you know

508
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,679
a large percentage of money or a large

509
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,119
amount of money invested in the economy

510
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,200
it's pretty hard for them to repeal the

511
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:14,798
laws but in Thailand I mean they have

512
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,720
this TI this is Thailand like uh you

513
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,759
know it's kind of a common saying here

514
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
but like you can't expect anything like

515
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,960
everything can be turned upside down at

516
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,159
any point here and uh you never really

517
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,600
know what's going to

518
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,360
happen but the acceptance being what it

519
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,359
is right now now um if it were to

520
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,599
flip-flop into the other party uh do you

521
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,879
think there would be a lot of

522
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,038
combativeness against the future of

523
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,360
cannabis I think you're going to see a

524
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,798
pretty big ass protest in Bangkok if

525
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,519
they do make it illegal you're going to

526
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,000
see in changai and Bangkok and probably

527
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,079
pataya as well you're going to see some

528
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,200
pretty massive protests of people going

529
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,639
don't [ __ ] with my money don't you know

530
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,080
what I mean like and also too I would

531
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,240
even imagine maybe some of the village

532
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,918
areas because yeah the definitely are

533
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,440
people that want to BL blame cannabis

534
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,840
for the different problems in society

535
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,440
but almost all those problems go back in

536
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,399
fact there was even a case This Week In

537
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,880
Paya of a guy losing his [ __ ] well it

538
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,679
turns out the guy was actually on meth

539
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,039
not cannabis right so like yeah I know

540
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,880
everybody knows that meth had Zach

541
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,879
stupid right like why don't why aren't

542
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,440
we cracking down on that but there's a

543
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,640
big meth issue here in Thailand because

544
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,720
of the um War neck store so for those

545
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,520
you who don't know Burma or uh what is

546
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:29,000
the new current name I think current

547
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:30,639
name is Myanmar that's it um me are uh

548
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,079
is currently having a civil war right

549
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,120
now like a full-blown pretty gnarly

550
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,879
Civil War and both sides both the Army

551
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,279
and the rebels are making meth uh buying

552
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,600
precursors from China because they're

553
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,839
next door uh and making meth at

554
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,599
industrial quantities and then uh using

555
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:49,199
that to fun buying bullets and army

556
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,439
supplies basically so um you have a

557
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,640
strange infl increase of meth in

558
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,880
Southeast Asia right now because of the

559
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,240
Civil War over there and

560
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,320
uh and that that's a way bigger problem

561
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,400
on the Cannabis is hands down what do

562
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,918
you think the education level on

563
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,759
cannabis is US versus

564
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,159
thain extremely low it's been again it's

565
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,798
been the biggest barrier and it's been

566
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,559
one of the things I've been trying to

567
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,918
address by doing a lot of translated

568
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,639
media um I just presented actually at a

569
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,880
at the canx Expo I did two whole

570
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,440
presentations and all of the

571
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,799
presentations were both in English and

572
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,640
Thai um I can't speak Tai but all the

573
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,200
slides were in Thai any of the reference

574
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,320
material any of the stuff that was like

575
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,840
step one step two step three all of it

576
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,558
was an English and TI so that they could

577
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,278
screenshot it and to try and break that

578
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,720
barrier but again that's that's the

579
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,759
number one enemy of Canam be at the

580
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,480
United States or Thailand or Zimbabwe U

581
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,519
it doesn't matter like the lack of

582
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,159
consumer education and regulator

583
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,000
education is the number one thing that's

584
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,679
[ __ ] us more than anything

585
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,960
else I see you guys over in the chat

586
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,320
just dying at the dying at the

587
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,278
aquaponics questions I feel like Steve

588
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,879
does a ton of aquaponic so I wanted to

589
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,319
get more into what he was doing over

590
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,240
there um but yes you also do the growing

591
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,839
with fishes podcast has that been on the

592
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,880
back burner for a while or are you still

593
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,158
pursuing

594
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,799
that yeah no I still do the growing with

595
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,039
fishes podcast we had a a week or two

596
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,480
off during um during 420 because I was

597
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,440
uh at the canx Expo and I just couldn't

598
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,599
get a good stable enough signal just to

599
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,519
broadcast with there with all the people

600
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,519
um so I gave up on trying to stream from

601
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,158
there but the original plan was to do an

602
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,599
episode from the stage there but we just

603
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,600
could not get the uh Logistics to work

604
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,918
but uh we did have an episode this week

605
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:34,439
um we are we have [ __ ]

606
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,038
336 episodes um each episode is one to

607
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,720
three hours most of them are two to

608
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,400
three hours um it's over 800 hours of

609
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,600
educational content we have tons of

610
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,759
amazing interviews we have almost five

611
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,519
hours with Frenchie and a whole bunch of

612
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,119
other people that have since left left

613
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,720
this plane so if you want to learn from

614
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,119
some of the old ogs that aren't with us

615
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,159
anymore we got a lot of amazing

616
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,479
interviews with them Michael mcshan's

617
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,480
another Warrior that's since moved on

618
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,079
and some other things like that so uh we

619
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,440
really have a lot of cool content on

620
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,158
there and a lot of like unique

621
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,640
interviews about unique topics that I

622
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
haven't really seen covered in some of

623
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,400
the other other shows it's really we

624
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,080
kind of try to angle on with the podcast

625
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,798
is like what's the show that I would

626
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:12,319
want to listen to each week and some of

627
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,038
the weird topics that I don't hear

628
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,879
listening to my friends podcasts and

629
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,359
stuff like that so we try to find some

630
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,360
of them the cookier or funkier people

631
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,038
that are doing something a little

632
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,079
different especially on the chemistry

633
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,879
side I'm always uh always wanting to

634
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,839
learn on that so do you do much uh

635
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
grafting

636
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,319
I haven't done any grafting since I've

637
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
been here I did some grafting back in

638
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,079
Pennsylvania when I was younger and then

639
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,880
out in Colorado because of the plant

640
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,240
counts just to get a couple strains onto

641
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,919
one mom but I have not done any grafting

642
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,200
here um there just hasn't been a need um

643
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,480
I've mostly done more grafting with

644
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,360
fruit trees than I have cannabis I when

645
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,640
you were saying that and the type of uh

646
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,038
people that you like to have on your

647
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,679
podcast the first place my mind went was

648
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:58,240
one of our uh our sip specialist over in

649
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,960
our Discord he teaches about sub

650
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,000
irrigated Planters he is known for

651
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,440
grafting he grafts a ton of plants for

652
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,599
the exact same reason low plant counts

653
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,240
trying to get more diversity you know

654
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,839
and different types in your grow um and

655
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
that made it to the point where he was

656
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,000
collecting a root stock and grafting his

657
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,759
many different types as he could on it

658
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,079
pretty I think it's an extremely

659
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,558
interesting topic uh how often do you do

660
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,918
your podcast

661
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:30,278
like on a schedule so I do my I do my

662
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,120
podcast every Thursday uh at 7:30 p.m.

663
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:33,278
Pacific sometimes it's a little earlier

664
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,599
sometimes it's a little later just

665
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,440
depends on what time zone the guest is

666
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,000
in um and where would you throw up a

667
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,240
notification about

668
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,440
that sure so they're always live on

669
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,839
YouTube and then we repost them on all

670
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,798
audio platforms and if anyone ever is

671
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:51,158
doing their own podcast highly suggest

672
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,200
cross- platforming it because uh we get

673
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,840
probably 20 to 40 times listeners in our

674
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,159
audio format than we do in our video

675
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,398
format

676
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:03,520
so uh p neon member Dan Panda wants to

677
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:05,439
know what's the best species of fish for

678
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,960
aquaponics it really depends on your

679
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,679
temperature in your climate in general

680
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,679
tilapia are kind of the best because you

681
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,080
can eat them they breed pretty readily

682
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,559
and unless your water gets very cold

683
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,359
they're not really a problem until you

684
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:20,038
get to about below 55 degrees Fahrenheit

685
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,879
U they should be kept above 62 but you

686
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,079
know ideally uh but if you have a power

687
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,520
outage you can let them go a little bit

688
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,359
lower before they start croaking on you

689
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,918
um uh Co would be the next best uh best

690
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,319
one because they have good resale values

691
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,278
you could do butterfly koi and you can

692
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,439
just flip them to you know any pond

693
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:40,200
store or or pet store as long as they're

694
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,000
decent you know in decent Health um and

695
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,759
they have the best return on value for

696
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,079
dollar gain uh in terms of something

697
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,000
that anyone could easily raise uh the

698
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,879
best return on dollar would be to start

699
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,599
raising arowanas or some of the other

700
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,360
real fancy asian fish but um you need to

701
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,119
know a little bit about how to select

702
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,278
the right ones but those can be you know

703
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,439
20,000

704
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,079
plus per fish if you really know start

705
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,798
knowing what you're doing and some cases

706
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,439
$80,000 a fish

707
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,158
enough

708
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,360
God what's that one that you have Dan he

709
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,120
has one that's very similar to like an

710
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,839
Arowana look but I I think it's a

711
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:19,639
different one though a knife fish maybe

712
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,038
we have knife fish here the the clown

713
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,880
kniv I was very happy to see that you're

714
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,679
a fisherman as

715
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,960
well oh yeah how does the fishing

716
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,080
differentiate it looked like you were

717
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,759
using a modern style pole how different

718
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,240
is it Western versus

719
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,919
Thailand so you can get a fishing rod

720
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
here I have two fishing rods we go

721
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,840
fishing almost every other Sunday I have

722
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,520
a next door I have a 86y old neighbor

723
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,000
and he doesn't have really anybody to

724
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,679
hang out with and his wife has passed

725
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,640
away so him and I hang out on Sundays

726
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,360
and have a couple beers by the river oh

727
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,200
yeah um but uh but yeah so and then a

728
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,398
lot of people net fish they'll Gil net

729
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,360
or they'll um uh

730
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,319
you know set up barriers and fish traps

731
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,119
those are really common here but uh a

732
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,798
lot of people also just they they'll dig

733
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:07,479
a couple ponds on their property and

734
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,319
then they'll just like breed and raise

735
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,798
fish and what they'll do is they'll get

736
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,319
like a little tiny lamp with an

737
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:16,079
extension cord and hang it like a foot

738
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,158
or two above the water with strings that

739
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,038
come from the grass that that just just

740
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,520
staked out around the pond and the

741
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,640
Crickets and stuff crawl up the the

742
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,158
string and go to the lamp and then fall

743
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,960
in you'll see all the fish hanging out

744
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
underneath it at night this waiting for

745
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,679
the bugs to fall in or the moths to hit

746
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,200
the water and they don't even pay to

747
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,640
feed the fish they just put a lamp on

748
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,880
the pond at night and they don't have to

749
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,679
do anything it's like the most low

750
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
effort low labor fish keeping you've

751
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,200
ever seen in your life like I have to

752
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,320
ask you something controversial you

753
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,640
posted about the dog liquor not too long

754
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,918
ago and the purple

755
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,159
stems yeah I won't throw any names out

756
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,679
there but I'd heard some very notorious

757
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,720
Growers um talk about the health of

758
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,120
plants and if the biology of the soil

759
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,839
and everything is on

760
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:03,239
uh there's no such thing as purple stems

761
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,439
um it's not genetic and anything healthy

762
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,919
will grow green how do you feel about

763
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,399
that I think those people have not grown

764
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,120
enough different types of genetics to

765
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:13,759
know what they're talking about um I've

766
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,319
I mean there's so many different ones

767
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,119
I've seen everything from Red stems to

768
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,359
purple stems to Blue stems it it's

769
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,558
cultiv our specific right and anywhere

770
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,240
where you have higher UV exposure the

771
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,798
tropics or high altitude you're going to

772
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,079
have significant increase in it for

773
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,639
instance um azing uh you guys probably

774
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,879
know who rosing is one of the most

775
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,240
popular instagrammers with Afghan stuff

776
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,640
is the red mif having nutrient issues no

777
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,640
no it's not and the stems are Crimson

778
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,360
right so uh again with that dog liquor

779
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,600
the buds looked great there's no

780
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,879
problems uh there's no sulfur issues

781
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,038
which is normally what it's attributed

782
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,360
to or phosphorus issues everything's

783
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,000
dialed in right so there's the plants

784
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:57,719
get liquid IMO for like in terms of

785
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,558
plant stuff every third watering right

786
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,558
there the biology is cranked in it's

787
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,558
living soil you know 40% of its compost

788
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:08,278
from previous runs like there's no you

789
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,918
know we're going low nutrient levels on

790
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:13,640
any of the feedings most of it's plant

791
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,600
ferments like there's no uh there's no

792
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,960
excess of any nutrient or imbalance of

793
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,319
any nutrient you know nothing that we

794
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,399
can test for in the runoff so you know I

795
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,079
don't know why why you know again I

796
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,359
understand you definitely can have

797
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,480
extreme sulfur issues that will do that

798
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,558
now when I was in Jamaica sulfur issues

799
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,839
is a problem with the um the leech Rock

800
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:34,918
and stuff there a lot of them are very

801
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,599
high in Sulfur so you can absolutely

802
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,278
have like red or pink stems and the

803
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,599
stuff I saw in Jamaica and I absolutely

804
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,278
think that was partially to do with the

805
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,278
mineral composition of the water of the

806
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,398
soil but the stuff we have here where

807
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:49,798
it's all controlled where we have 30 or

808
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:51,719
40 different fenos and only one or two

809
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:53,519
of them is showing that purple and

810
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,880
everything looks identically

811
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,200
healthy there there's no issue it's just

812
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,840
that particular feno is increasing the

813
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,038
aneson production in the stem because

814
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,240
it's trying to protect itself from the

815
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,720
UV like what let's let's talk about this

816
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,000
maybe a different way why are the plants

817
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,839
purple or red it's anthocyanin

818
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,359
production why does the plant produce

819
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:14,599
anthocyanin either as a UV protectant or

820
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,678
an antifreeze okay so if it's cold and

821
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,199
you get you know big 20 30 degree

822
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,559
temperature swings daytime to night time

823
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,600
the plant thinks it might get cold

824
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,119
enough to freeze right totally makes

825
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,839
sense so it's going to produce the

826
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,798
antifreeze to keep that tissue Dam

827
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,599
reduce tissue damage or if it's high

828
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,918
altitude or in the tropics like I am

829
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,158
you're going to have that increased anth

830
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,038
thein production because it's trying to

831
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,919
protect itself from the UV damage right

832
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:37,919
Anin is very good at that the other

833
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,240
thing that plants other reason why

834
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,240
plants will produce anthocyanin is to

835
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,558
lock up the malum now if you have too

836
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,038
much malum or Venum it can actually um

837
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,918
bind to the nitrogen and or not bind to

838
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,599
the nitrogen but can can affect nitrogen

839
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,840
uptake so the plant will actually

840
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,599
produce extra anth thein to bind up some

841
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,398
of that Malin or Venum depending on

842
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,319
which one's and Mild excess to to lock

843
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:04,319
out that malum so it doesn't have that

844
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,960
negative impact on nitrogen uptake so

845
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,359
there's a lot of different reasons why

846
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,480
plants produce an thesy it's not just

847
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:12,000
because the sulfur was too high which I

848
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,919
think a lot of people have been horribly

849
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,278
miseducated on and I don't think it's

850
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,038
their fault I just think that no one

851
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,839
ever taught them you know they just

852
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:22,079
didn't go through a botney class they

853
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:25,119
were never properly educated on the

854
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,480
topic that's a great answer and I

855
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:30,239
completely agree with you for most of

856
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,759
that that I didn't know before but holy

857
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,440
crap man I did yeah I'd never even gone

858
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,200
into it that much definitely soil

859
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,798
biology affecting it but uh going into

860
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,639
the malignant uh attaching itself with

861
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:44,000
the nitrogen I've never even heard of

862
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,798
that before that's incredible um it's

863
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,919
one of the most common things I fix in

864
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:49,519
lettuce Farms so one of the most common

865
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,038
questions I get on lettuce aquaponic

866
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,720
producers is hey my red salus lettuce or

867
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:57,558
my red Oakleaf is not red anymore I go

868
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,720
in I test it the libum is at zero or

869
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:03,278
0.001 or something abysmally low I dose

870
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,120
the malum back up to like 08 parts per

871
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,000
million and then it drift out and I know

872
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,398
that's you know you can you can dose it

873
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,919
as high as as one parts per million but

874
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:13,759
for the most part we're usually dosing

875
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,480
it between 0.1 and and 04 but if it's

876
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,398
straight at zero and the plants have to

877
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,679
like deplete what's in the water column

878
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,479
to replace it because it's flat zero

879
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,080
then we'll dose it at like a 0 6 to

880
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,038
point8 just to because the plants are

881
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,759
going to immediately obliterate you know

882
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,000
a large percentage of that right off the

883
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,278
bat so but if you're trying to force

884
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,480
those purples make sure you're dosing at

885
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,359
like 0.1.2 ppms when you flip the flower

886
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,000
and it's super simple I mean you could

887
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:42,439
buy like you know a few grams of it and

888
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,359
it'll last you you know 10 grams of

889
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,159
it'll last most grower is five years you

890
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:50,638
know it doesn't take very

891
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:53,320
much um in the same aspect as the

892
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:56,319
anthocyanins with the red stem cultivars

893
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,638
is that just an excess of carotenoids

894
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,119
and what does that come

895
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,678
from you know I my honest answer is I'm

896
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,199
not quite sure on that I don't have a a

897
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,759
proper answer on that I honestly don't

898
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,360
know something we're going to have to

899
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:12,278
look into more I didn't know if it would

900
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:14,158
be just how the anasan ananin were

901
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:15,960
expressing uh where it didn't get a

902
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,639
purple Hue it got more of red Hue kind

903
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,200
of like when you get a lavender Bud

904
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:23,558
versus like a black ass bud um something

905
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,759
like that versus like the Indian red

906
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,720
stems where you know oranges and reds

907
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,599
are more associated with the carotenoids

908
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,720
was that production happening for the

909
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,558
the same type of reason that there was

910
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,278
some something that was locking it out

911
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,678
or an excess

912
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,000
of again that's just something I'm my

913
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,120
knowledge is uh is not as good on so I

914
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,398
don't want to oh man hiden the bong I'll

915
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,398
join

916
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:55,959
you what smoking on over there

917
00:33:52,359 --> 00:34:00,759
Steve apples and banana by

918
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:03,558
uh chat Tree Garden in

919
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:06,158
Bangkok uh Panda wants to know what size

920
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:08,599
Reservoir Pond would be suitable for

921
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,599
starting

922
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
out uh it just depends on what you're

923
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,638
trying to do so if you're trying to grow

924
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,639
cannabis I wouldn't do anything smaller

925
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,399
than a 40 gallon aquarium for one or two

926
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,599
plants that seems to be the kind of the

927
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,960
extreme end of it you could maybe get

928
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,480
away with a 29 gallon if you really

929
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,079
heavily stocked it um that's going to be

930
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,599
the extreme end on the small side

931
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,720
and after that you know kind of anything

932
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,760
up from there you need about a 75 or 90

933
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,918
gallon tank if you want to do four four

934
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,280
plants um and then kind of you know up

935
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,918
from there depending on what it is that

936
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,839
you're trying to grow or how many plants

937
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:46,759
you're trying to grow I am OB seen

938
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:49,398
that's just absolutely jealous that you

939
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,560
got to see all those ruins in Thailand

940
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:53,398
I'm a huge ruins person it doesn't

941
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,358
matter where we go I want to see the

942
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,639
history of that area and I don't see

943
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,960
anything more beautiful I'm really into

944
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:04,480
Egyptian culture so ruins like that or

945
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,440
old Egyptian uh pyramids caves tunnels

946
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,440
anything like that even the T the caves

947
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,920
in Romania just any of that old folkl

948
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,679
but when I saw you post pictures of the

949
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,440
Thai temple I automatically went [ __ ]

950
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:20,639
Tomb Raider man like I want to see this

951
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,320
[ __ ] how was it fun I feel like it would

952
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,159
be spiritual just being on those

953
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,119
grounds Yeah man so the temples that I

954
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,879
you saw were the the old ones anyway

955
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,160
there's a new one that that's close to

956
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,640
me that's up in pachon that's beautiful

957
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,719
but it's not that kind of inspiring the

958
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,118
way the old ones are but the old ones

959
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:43,078
are all chamir camir ruins so those are

960
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,680
exactly from the same um Temple complex

961
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,640
as the uh the stuff in Tomb Raider

962
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,838
that's actually filmed over Anor wat

963
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:53,199
which is the exact same Kingdom it's

964
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,639
just down another 200 miles or 300 miles

965
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,480
to the the uh East from where that

966
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,679
Temple was but that that's the far end

967
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,159
of it so that that whole Temple complex

968
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,078
used to go from Cambodia all the way

969
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,078
into Thailand and if you look in one of

970
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760
the pictures there's a stairwell stair

971
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,160
set that kind of goes down and then back

972
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,240
up and you can see it just kind of Go

973
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:14,199
off into the the the Horizon that goes

974
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,199
all the way to ankor you can walk from

975
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,559
that Temple all the way to Anker wat in

976
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,000
Cambodia obviously with a border

977
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,358
crossing but um you can actually

978
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,318
physically walk the same ancient path

979
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:26,480
that you know people did you know a

980
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,960
thousand years ago to get there and

981
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,838
there pretty cool I interesting culture

982
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,720
they're completely separate from the uh

983
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:36,679
more modern chamir that maybe have less

984
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:43,239
of a PR uh less of a favorable PR

985
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:44,799
uh to say the least um but uh the uh uh

986
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,000
the temples there are just incredible

987
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,640
and just again like you're talking about

988
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,599
huge ancient trees like growing out of

989
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,159
you know three 400-year-old tree growing

990
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,800
out of the side of a temple like

991
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:57,118
especially the second temple that I went

992
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,760
to seeing these giant trees kind of like

993
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,720
shading the reflection pools and like

994
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,640
just ah it was just so cool it's it's

995
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,959
one of my favorite parts of Thailand and

996
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,960
there's another one that I haven't gone

997
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,039
to yet that's like I guess was like one

998
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,599
of the stables for the elephant Warriors

999
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,318
and stuff like that and that's one of

1000
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,240
the ones I want to see but a lot of it's

1001
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:16,440
kind of collap it's more ruined than

1002
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,719
some of the other ones but uh it was

1003
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
where they had the war elephants and

1004
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:21,679
stuff which is super cool because uh

1005
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,519
especially out in buram that was where

1006
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,039
they used to you know breed and raise

1007
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,239
the war elephants and stuff like that

1008
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,159
when they would go to war and they had

1009
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,239
these GI like Towers on top of the

1010
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,078
elephants that have like two levels of

1011
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,199
archers firing off the back of the

1012
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,839
elephants and stuff like it was crazy

1013
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,159
like crazy way crazier than the stuff

1014
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,759
you see in video games if you if you do

1015
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,759
why we would love to see some pictures

1016
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,359
of that me especially um I saw your

1017
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,839
video on the rat

1018
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:51,440
roulette what else have you seen over

1019
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:55,318
there that might blow my

1020
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,039
mind oh man I got to think on that one

1021
00:37:55,318 --> 00:38:00,159
um just watching tourists interact with

1022
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,599
monkeys is hilarious because the maacs

1023
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,480
totally know how to like Punk tourists

1024
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,920
so that's always really hilarious and in

1025
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,599
fact if you saw on the news there was a

1026
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,280
temple where all the monks got arrested

1027
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,720
for doing meth that was one of the

1028
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,960
monkey temples that's near me yeah so

1029
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,799
that was a monkey temple so it was like

1030
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,039
well all the monkeys on meth too because

1031
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,880
that' be pretty

1032
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,318
crazy but um that that was definitely

1033
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,039
one interesting um the snake temple in

1034
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:31,920
in um Bangkok is pretty insane just in

1035
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:34,960
terms of like wow that exists um so they

1036
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,519
have a temple for cobras in downtown

1037
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,280
Bangkok basically and it it's it's like

1038
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,480
a you go down the street and then

1039
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,560
suddenly one of like the front faces of

1040
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,760
the like regular Street Front is a

1041
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,199
temple right so you walk through and

1042
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,960
there's like a gift shop and all this

1043
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,919
kinds of stuff and you can buy eggs or

1044
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,838
CH raw chicken and other stuff and then

1045
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,960
there's like baskets with rope like

1046
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,400
against the railing and you can put your

1047
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,920
you could buy your offering and put it

1048
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,639
in there and then lower it down into

1049
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,720
this Courtyard which is out the back of

1050
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:06,559
the temple and inside the behind all

1051
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,039
these buildings is a courtyard and it's

1052
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,880
filled with all the cobras and pythons

1053
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,519
and snakes they find throughout Bangkok

1054
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,280
people put them there as like this

1055
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,960
Temple place so there's like hundreds of

1056
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,560
cobras in the middle of downtown and

1057
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,639
people like feeding them eggs and

1058
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,599
chickens on ropes with baskets it's the

1059
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,719
strangest thing like I've never seen

1060
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,640
anything like that re so many like

1061
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,480
venomous creatures and everyone's just

1062
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,598
like chill about it like I've never seen

1063
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,838
anything like that it's then once in a

1064
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,440
while too someone will come walking

1065
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:38,519
through the temple like holding a snake

1066
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,519
by the head to like put into the pit you

1067
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,838
know that they caught somewhere around

1068
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:44,039
town so it's you never like you gotta

1069
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,400
really pay attention there because

1070
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,559
someone could come up behind you with a

1071
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:52,318
cobra in their hand you know it's pretty

1072
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,559
wild talk about walking on eggshells

1073
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:57,079
Jesus other than that the food here is

1074
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,318
amazing you'll see some stuff that you

1075
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:03,039
definitely don't I've seen mongus at the

1076
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:06,679
market I've seen I saw you eat that

1077
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,679

1079
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:13,199
them in pasta or in rice they are super

1080
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,560
yummy it tastes like U water chestnuts

1081
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,399
with like a little more of a Nutty

1082
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,719
flavor but it it's a good compliment to

1083
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,599
like a starch you

1084
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:25,039
know I like water chestnuts I feel like

1085
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:28,440
it's the texture there's got to be like

1086
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,039
some juicy guts in there no no no the

1087

1090
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,400
the fruit here there's one that I love

1091
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,279
the flavor of but it's seriously like

1092
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,160
eating a ball of snot when you you eat

1093
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,920
the inside uh the all around the the

1094
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,920
seed is like a big ball I have some in

1095
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,680

one hold on I'll just grab them hold I

1097
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,399
don't know what the English word is is

1098
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,319
an English word they look like an evil

1099
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,318
strawberry

1100
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,119
well on the inside they're real snotty

1101
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,119
but they're super

1102
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,920
flavorful yeah they look kind of like

1103
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,000
a old man ball sack version of a

1104
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,680
strawberry yeah if you hanging down from

1105
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,400
the

1106
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,759
P oh Panda said he had an

1107
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,160
Arowana yeah arowana is a great man I

1108
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,839
used to work in the pet trade before I

1109
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,279
worked in cannabis and that's how I got

1110
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:29,400
into cannabis is they had a grow room

1111
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,040
downstairs and um we the blue arowanas

1112
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,240
back and the black arowanas back in the

1113
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,159
day used to be quite pricey and now they

1114
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:38,639
have all kinds of fancy ones or scribble

1115
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:40,920
lines and super Reds and albinos and

1116
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,400
platinums and those are the ones that go

1117
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,559
like the scribbles and stuff go for

1118
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,160
60,000 plus some of the the fancy long

1119
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,759
fins and stuff can go for 80,000 plus I

1120
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:53,920
didn't ask you about and usually I asked

1121
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,520
my guess uh what is your history with

1122
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,639
cannabis that's pretty insane to Le on

1123
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:02,119
you worked at a pet store with a can we

1124
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:05,480
talk about it sure yeah yeah so in the

1125
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,039
east coast um a lot of the pet trade was

1126
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,159
well it probably still is uh used as a

1127
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,239
front right so they use it to trickle

1128
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:14,358
their money especially aquarium

1129
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,199
maintenance companies it's not uncommon

1130
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,480
for them to have 50% or more of the

1131
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:22,078
customers be on paper only right so uh

1132
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,960
that that's a common thing allegedly uh

1133
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:29,039
and the book I'm writing

1134
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,720
so um the uh so I used to work at this

1135
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,599
place called pet fantasy when I was a

1136
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,959
kid there was a um a pet store that was

1137
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,280
like one of the only places that was

1138
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,280
close enough for my house that I could

1139
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,400
just go on my own you know so I'd hang

1140
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,680
out there all all the day and when I was

1141
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,240
12 years old I caught one of the

1142
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,919
employees stealing cash out of the

1143
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:47,279
register and I told the owner because

1144
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,039
like he's my homie and he went and like

1145
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,640
drained the kids pockets and found the

1146
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,000
cash and fired him and was like well

1147
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,279
you're honest and you know where all the

1148
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,440
animals are and how to take care of them

1149
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,640
you want a job so I got hired that day

1150
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,039
uh and ended up working there for about

1151
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,960
a year and then one day I like couldn't

1152
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,519
find the boss go out and I knew there

1153
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,280
was like a basement that I'd never been

1154
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:09,599
in and then they had a whole grow and

1155
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,280
you know a separate room with a whole

1156
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,480
bunch of other animals that were not on

1157
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,800
the list upstairs and uh got exposed to

1158
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,119
A Whole New World that I didn't know

1159
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,318
existed yet so that was pretty cool and

1160
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,318
then from there got into the grow scene

1161
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:25,440
at a pretty young age back in the east

1162
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:30,558
coast and then from there later on moved

1163
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:33,119
up into um a different company uh well

1164
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,559
how do I put it end up working for the

1165
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,920
long story short ended up working for

1166
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,040
the Army Post Office and while I was

1167
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,480
working for the Army Post

1168
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,318
Office I uh met one of the guys from

1169
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,920
USPS and we got talking and eventually

1170
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,199
kind of realized we were both Stoners we

1171
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,680
hung out one day he invited me over and

1172
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:53,598
we smoked like three hat like like hash

1173
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:57,239
pucks like the Keith pucks and he's like

1174
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,039
you grow and I was like how the [ __ ] do

1175
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,919
you know that and he goes you just

1176
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,239
smoked three Keef pucks nobody else that

1177
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,318
that like except for Growers would have

1178
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,519
that tolerance or that access to stuff

1179
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,000
he goes come here and he invites me into

1180
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,119
his garage and he had a big [ __ ] full

1181
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,800
garage full of plants like the nicest

1182
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,160
plants I had ever seen them like Way

1183
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,359
Beyond what I had done in terms of like

1184
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:22,399
quality and and all the

1185
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,199
rest and uh after a little while like

1186
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,400
working with him after a couple months

1187
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:27,759
he he's like go to this property here

1188
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,920
and I'll meet you there like whatever

1189
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,040
time so I get there there's a barn and

1190
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,760
it's two stories of plants and I was

1191
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,599
like [ __ ] and that was the first time I

1192
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,280
ever saw like a thousand or more plants

1193
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,079
like in in one place so that was super

1194
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,760
cool so I worked with him for a bit uh I

1195
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,359
didn't know up working for a landscaping

1196
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,040
company and they had a big grow in one

1197
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:51,719
of their green houses as well so um that

1198
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:53,838
was kind of on the DL so uh ended up

1199
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:56,838
kind of continuing on my agricultural

1200
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,838
Journey that way and then then when uh I

1201
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:00,480
had an opportunity to move to Colorado

1202
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,159
um but my father was still sick with

1203
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,480
cancer and I had to decline it and I was

1204
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,960
like really bummed because I really

1205
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,719
wanted to go grow weed legally you know

1206
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,119
what I mean kind of wanted to go legit

1207
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,879
you know what I mean and then about

1208
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,519
eight months later my dad had finally

1209
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,440
finished his cancer treatments he was

1210
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:16,280
like CLE you know free and in the clear

1211
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,079
with with his stuff and I got an

1212
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,599
opportunity to go back to that same job

1213
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,280
offer that I'd been given at Colorado

1214
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,599
they had fired the original guy that

1215
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,240
they had hired that instead of me and

1216
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,160
offered me this job back again and I

1217
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:30,199
took that one out to Colorado and then

1218
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,719
uh kind of killed it out there worked

1219
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:34,039
for a couple places there and then when

1220
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:35,719
the floods happened in Colorado uh the

1221
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,159
place I was working for had the whole

1222
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:41,039
back wall get blown out by mud because

1223
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,440
of the landslides and stuff so uh I lost

1224
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,800
my job there um and basically was told

1225
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,960
like hey we'll hire you back when we

1226
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,240
finally get a facility again but you

1227
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,800
know go work for somebody else for now

1228
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,439
so I ended up applying to the aquaponic

1229
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,599
Source I got hired there for product

1230
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,800
development and um eventually after two

1231
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,599
weeks got uh switched over to their

1232
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,760
cannabis and uh and research lab once

1233
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,079
she realized what my experience was and

1234
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,640
we developed the whole aquaponic

1235
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,079
cannabis program there at the aquaponic

1236
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:12,239
source for a couple of years we did a

1237
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,680
test runs both um in our we had a 50 by3

1238
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,078
Greenhouse that we had and off offsite

1239
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,838
uh that was fully licensed which was

1240
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,240
really nice that we kind of tinker and

1241
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,759
we had like wicking beds and flood and

1242
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,078
drain beds and dwc like we we tried to

1243
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,480
experiment with like all the different

1244
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,160
ways you could grow it and kind of see

1245
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,920
what was going to work best how to dial

1246
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,838
it in like because we didn't know you

1247
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,318
know at that time so just did a punch a

1248
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:34,759
bunch of R&amp;D with a bunch of different

1249
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:36,119
types of setups until we kind of figured

1250
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,480
out what worked which was the Dual root

1251
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,200
Zone setups or uh sip setups if you're

1252
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,039
going to do a real big scale doing it

1253
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:43,960
sips makes a little bit more sense labor

1254
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:46,558
wise but on the smaller scale dual root

1255
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,000
zones or espe certainly for your moms um

1256
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,839
you can push growth much better with the

1257
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,119
Dual root zones that's amazing man uh

1258
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:56,318
why is it the smaller scale is better

1259
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,480
for the Dual root Zone besides the root

1260
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,159
just from a labor standpoint um you know

1261
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,599
you're doing 14,000 plants you can

1262
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,039
absolutely do dual root Zone but it's

1263
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,280
just a little more time on the pots

1264
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,119
that's all you know when you're doing it

1265
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,119
acre scale you know it starts to be a

1266
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,039
little less uh what would be that

1267
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,838
threshold where you would change from

1268
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,759
one or the other about a quarter acre

1269
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:17,318
half acre then it it starts to make a

1270
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,200
little more sense to to do it the other

1271
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:21,119
way and again it depends on your labor

1272
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,838
cost in Thailand or Africa it's not like

1273
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,480
you're breaking the bank um on on you

1274
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,039
know labor costs per plant but in this

1275
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,639
EU it's a little bit different so um

1276
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:30,719
that would be the biggest thing and then

1277
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:33,519
so after they're working at the

1278
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,598
aquaponic soures they eventually uh came

1279
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,920
in one day after they recently sold the

1280
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,359
company and the new owners wanted

1281
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,519
nothing to do with cannabis because it

1282
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:42,558
was uh becoming problematic for their

1283
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:46,000
accounting which it used to be very much

1284
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,559
so up until pretty recently so um and

1285
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,400
even still is a problem depending on

1286
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:51,839
what what you're doing so they basically

1287
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,200
uh gave me that part of the company and

1288
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:57,400
told me to get [ __ ] and uh uh you know

1289
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,960
kind of as a Severance and uh and that

1290
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,280
was that so I started my own consulting

1291
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:08,639
company and since then of in 2016 2015

1292
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,720
2016 2016 uh and February of 2016 and um

1293
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,159
since then I've been going around the

1294
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,279
planet doing great I couldn't ask for a

1295
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:17,799
better life man if if you had told me

1296
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,000
I'd gone to Africa and Southeast Asia

1297
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,680
and all over to grow cannabis when I was

1298
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,960
16 years old I've been like you're crazy

1299
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,960
you know that's amazing man when

1300
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,000
accomplishment out of all the places

1301
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,838
that you've gone can we say a favorite

1302
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,480
is there a favorite I don't know man

1303
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,799
it's a close one between Jamaica and

1304
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:41,639
Thailand um I love Beach life in Jamaica

1305
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,318
and Jamaica gets a bad rap like the

1306
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,879
cities definitely can be rough and not

1307
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,480
pleasant I'll put it that way but I the

1308
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,960
nicest people I've ever met in my whole

1309
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,599
[ __ ] life as side from people here in

1310
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,720
Thailand they're equ equally as nice uh

1311
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,280
we're in rural Jamaica like we had our

1312
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:00,679
car breakdown between St Mary's and

1313
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,000
Kingston in like the back middle of

1314
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:04,598
nowhere in the mountains taking the the

1315
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,280
long route not the highway route that

1316
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:07,760
exists now that didn't exist when we

1317
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,599
were doing this the the freeway that

1318
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,000
goes to Kingston now from oo um our car

1319
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,798
broke down and we're in the middle of

1320
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,400
nowhere on like a two-lane road with

1321
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,798
just enough area on the shoulder to like

1322
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,559
get the car so that we're not in traffic

1323
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:22,639
and these two guys appear out of nowhere

1324
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,280
after about 35 minutes and we're like

1325
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,000
all holding something that could be like

1326
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,480
a weapon because we don't know what what

1327
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,760
these guys want and they just offer to

1328
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,358
help us they help try to repair the car

1329
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,680
it becomes clear that we have a broken

1330
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,798
part and that we need to go buy a piece

1331
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,399
for the car so they're like cool you

1332
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:38,639
can't go anywhere come back to our house

1333
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,160
and they kicked their kids out of their

1334
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,759
beds and gave us a place to sleep they

1335

1338
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,119

1342
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,798
way dude tell me a single place in the

1343
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,880
US where that would happen not going to

1344
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:03,239
happen dude like the level of kindness

1345
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,519
you have and and Thailand's the same way

1346
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:07,759
right like you have people that are

1347
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,960
infinitely grateful for for for

1348
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,480
everything in life and happy to help you

1349
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,960
with whatever you need if you have a

1350
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,719
problem and you don't have that kind of

1351
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,358
selflessness with Western culture it

1352
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:21,439
doesn't exist I mean sure some people do

1353
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:22,679
but as a whole not as like go to any

1354
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,880
rural area and you're going to be

1355
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:27,519
treated like that in Jamaica in Thailand

1356
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,760
and absolutely is like that and you know

1357
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,119
that's one and let's extent too Zimbabwe

1358
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,319
was a lot like that too again anywhere

1359
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,000
where you have people that just don't

1360
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:37,639
have a whole lot community and and

1361
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,838
kindness matters a lot more in life and

1362
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:41,759
you know it makes the world a better

1363
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:45,159
place appreciation for the foundations

1364
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,200
life yeah um before we get going here

1365
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:49,838
I've got a couple more questions for you

1366
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,879
and then we'll get headed out um breeder

1367
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,599

1368
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,039

1369
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,000
other day and I had listened to your

1370
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,000
podcast before and I was like Steve yeah

1371
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,920
I got to get him on for sure he was

1372
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,480
saying what a great job you were doing

1373
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,440
out there and that he really appreciated

1374
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,519
the work that you were doing um so

1375
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,559
congratulations on that that's a high

1376
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:12,039
honor uh I saw you post about a ton of

1377
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,319
bugs you had you'd mentioned the snakes

1378
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,639
I saw you holding a [ __ ]

1379
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,838
scorpion I'm I'm not scared of many

1380
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:21,239
things but I don't know if I would hold

1381
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,798
a [ __ ] Scorpion or that other uh

1382
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,039
what's it called the venaro vinegaroon

1383
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:27,798
yeah so as I was talking earlier I

1384
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:29,558
worked in the pet trade right so we used

1385
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:31,838
to have venomous snakes and scorpions

1386
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:34,400
and spiders and tarantulas so none of

1387
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,400
that stuff phases me at all so with the

1388
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,519
exception of like black mambas or maybe

1389
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,200
a king cobra the only thing start to be

1390
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:41,838
like okay maybe I'm just gonna sit back

1391
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:43,639
and take a long range picture anything

1392
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:45,519
else I'm gonna go pick it up and get a

1393
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:47,558
picture of me holding it because that's

1394
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,480
what I like to do right like and and

1395
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:51,480
I've I've held all kinds of crazy [ __ ]

1396
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,880
that you should never hold that you know

1397
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,599
whatever but I've only been tagged by

1398
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,960
Vine snakes I've only paid for it twice

1399
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,838
and both times or by a snake that was

1400
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,519
pretty mild so um I'm not overly

1401
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,440
concerned about it I I'm I'm pretty

1402
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,318
confident in my abilities to handle

1403
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,639
dangerous animals and have been doing it

1404
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:09,558
since I was a child so I'm not not

1405
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:13,358
overly worried about it like you're not

1406
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:15,960
about to go go play with a bear no no no

1407
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm not a I do have two wolf dogs that

1408
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,318
eventually there's a limit I do have two

1409
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,358
wolf hybrids as pets that are back in

1410
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,798
Colorado or Oklahoma right now that need

1411
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:26,440
to come out here I haven't quite sorted

1412
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:28,759
out the leg on you but I'm going to wait

1413
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,679
till the election as I was saying before

1414
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,440
I'm not going to bring them over here

1415
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,879
till the election happens just because I

1416
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,400
need to know exactly whether or not this

1417
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,960
is going to be a long-term thing or not

1418
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,280
but assuming the election goes

1419
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,679
pleasantly um pretty much posted up here

1420
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,920
in Thailand for the foreseeable future

1421
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:45,159
because the pay is nice the cost of

1422
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,000
living is nice the food is incredible

1423
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:49,480
you know the people here are really nice

1424
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,280
the right now the industry can support

1425
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,119
you know at least for a while is is

1426
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,359
going to be pretty pretty profitable so

1427
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,838
I don't uh I don't see a reason to come

1428
00:52:56,358 --> 00:52:59,199
back to the States especially until you

1429
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,798
guys have your election which I don't

1430
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,000
think is going to be very fun

1431
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:07,039
either I don't feel like they really

1432
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,519
have been for like [ __ ] 20 years now

1433
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,880
oh I watched Trump get elected from

1434
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,719
Jamaica and that was uh that was

1435
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,640
entertaining to say the

1436
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:16,358
least think you and I mind m a lot on

1437
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:18,798
that

1438
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:21,358
[ __ ] so let's go back before we get

1439
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,199
ourselves in trouble with politics uh

1440
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,078
you've seen these crazy ass bugs you've

1441
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,558
seen uh well I guess scorpion what do

1442
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,359
that count

1443
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:32,519
as I know Panda's in here too he knows

1444
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,960
all of his [ __ ] animals what is that

1445
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:37,119
a scorpions you mean scorpions and

1446
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,280
vinegaroons those are

1447
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:42,599
arachnids okay I thought so um same as

1448
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,640
spiders yeah anything with eight legs

1449
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,798
what has changed with your IPM program

1450
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:49,719
that you've not experienced before here

1451
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:51,559
in Thailand I can tell you firsthand we

1452
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:54,519
have thrip species here that are immune

1453
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:56,760
to most things um there's one thrip

1454
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:58,440
species here that seems to only react to

1455
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,160
White oil and that's the only which is

1456
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,240
equivalent to S oil X in the states um

1457
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:04,798
that's the only thing that seems to

1458
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,679
knock them back and we've hit them with

1459
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:09,880
over eight different bio controls

1460
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:11,879
Bavaria balana multiple strains iseria

1461
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,680
fer

1462
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:18,519
metum um militaris like you name it any

1463
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:20,519
of the normal go-tos we've thrown heavy

1464
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:22,358
dos I'm talking like four times the

1465
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,798
normal dose and they still can't get

1466
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:29,400
them to zero so that's been the first in

1467
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:31,759
yeah ceps at him too yeah um everything

1468
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,318
you can think of that I canch out here

1469
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,520
didn't it definitely saw some infection

1470
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,239
but the infection rate was like 20%

1471
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:41,519
instead of like

1472
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:43,919
90% yeah like really really heavily

1473
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,318
immune to pretty much everything and if

1474
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,318
they made it to the states y'all are

1475
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:49,519
[ __ ] like especially if they get

1476
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:52,079
established in the South or SoCal like

1477
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,960
do not take cuts from anybody in [ __ ]

1478
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,200
Thailand that's growing outdoor I'm just

1479
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,318
going to go ahead and say that like

1480
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,879
because if you bring this [ __ ] to the

1481
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:01,400
States you guys are going to cry hard

1482
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,960
I'm just going to tell you that um wor

1483
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,680
than they also have a a they have a

1484
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,838
broad Mite here that makes russet mites

1485
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,598
look cute uh they have a broad Mite here

1486
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:11,558
that's smaller than the normal broad

1487
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,280
mites in the states is like

1488
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:15,400
significantly smaller than the ones in

1489
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,079
the States but it looks identical they

1490
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,760
carry the girlfriends around on the back

1491
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:21,160
legs same way and everything um you know

1492
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,599
just like abroad Mite does but they're

1493
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:24,838
smaller than any of the ones I've ever

1494
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:27,400
photographed in the US so that's another

1495
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:29,838
one but they're easily smashed like the

1496
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,079
two rows I've I've visited that had them

1497
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,038
they were able to get rid of them after

1498
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:36,240
30 days with just using white oil and

1499
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:39,440
heavy defoliation and and just you know

1500
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,879
cleaning the place up um and then taking

1501
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,440
clones from that once they knocked it

1502
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,920
back or just to restart to make sure

1503
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,519
everything was clean so um that's that's

1504
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,159
not been a problem but um definitely

1505
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,679
something that if you didn't know what

1506
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:51,679
you're looking at and you're looking for

1507
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,919
them you're not going to see them with

1508
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:55,038
your eyeballs right they're they're

1509
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,159
simply too small you have to scope them

1510
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:59,240
and that's and I have a a little handy

1511
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:01,838
scope that I got the $30 scope you can

1512
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:03,959
get from Amazon is great because you can

1513
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,880
carry it around spray it with alcohol or

1514
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,519
whatever to disinfect it between you go

1515
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,039
between different rooms and and you

1516
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,519
don't care you know it works great and

1517
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:13,839
hey if you drop it or break it or it

1518
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,639
gets wet ah I'm out 30 bucks like no big

1519
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,318
deal but I use that all the time I have

1520
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,920
my tablet I have a big tablet and I just

1521
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,519
take that and I scope it I look it on

1522
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,400
the tablet and I can make the picture

1523
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,639
you know the size of a normal sheet of

1524
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,559
paper and then I can go through the grow

1525
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,000
really rapidly and Scout and uh yeah it

1526
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:33,319
it makes my life so much easier I don't

1527
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,838
have to take leaves from the grow into

1528
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:35,920
the lab and put it on the microscope I

1529
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:37,719
might have something that I really want

1530
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,639
to check out further that I do that with

1531
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:41,480
but it just helps me reduce the amount

1532
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:43,199
of material moving around the farm and

1533
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,920
and improves the speed of scouting

1534
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,679
because you know scouting always takes

1535
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,280
one to two hours a day or more you know

1536
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,598
any facility so um the faster that you

1537
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,200
can accurately and and very carefully go

1538
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:56,119
through a grow like that and have that

1539
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:57,759
kind of instant picture because if I did

1540
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:59,760
have a spider might or a russet might or

1541
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,319
a broad might come in off of somebody's

1542
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,680
clothes or something I can detect it

1543
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:05,199
while it's still at that super

1544
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:07,639
manageable level before it's now causing

1545
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,919
plant damage or whatever those kinds of

1546
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:10,960
mites you need to catch them before

1547
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,318
you're seeing the damage otherwise you

1548
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,119
know you already have a huge uphill

1549
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:19,038
battle absolutely um before we get going

1550
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:21,000
here what are your top three favorite

1551
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,760
strains of all

1552
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,480
time we're on a desert island I go you

1553
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,520
can pick three things take with you

1554
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:31,199
Steve stuff I've grown uh warlock was

1555
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,679
really good in Colorado for purple

1556
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,919
strain that just had really good depth

1557
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:39,598
of profile on it

1558
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,599
um remember that name next up next up

1559
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,760
would

1560
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:45,680
be I'm a big fan of the red Lebanese

1561
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:50,119
Puck that we have from crickets and

1562
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:52,399
cicada that one's really really fire and

1563
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:54,960
the

1564
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,639
um banana something or other the

1565
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,679
dragonfly had I can't remember what it

1566
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,440
was called banana

1567
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,759
something but that [ __ ] I can't remember

1568
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,119
the name of

1569
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,079
it banana something or other but it was

1570
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,960
dragonfly Earth medicine had it and it I

1571
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,200
smoked that and it was like 16 or 177%

1572
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,039
and I was [ __ ] up that was the first

1573
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,919
time I ever had one a strain that I knew

1574
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,280
for a fact it wasn't nearly as potent as

1575
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,960
some of the other ones I had smoked that

1576
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,559
morning but the tpping profile just like

1577
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,480
rung my bell and that's when I realized

1578
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:27,559
like oh the turp profile was like 70% of

1579
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,480
the

1580
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,519
experience so yeah that was my first

1581
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,480
like jarring experience with that whole

1582
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:39,400
thing at at Emerald cup one day in the

1583
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,920
tents there oh yeah love those ones I I

1584
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,480
felt the exact same way about the the

1585
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,639
Egyptian Sinai that one was really good

1586
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,838
and I don't think that was uh I believe

1587
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,000
the original preservationist said that

1588
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:54,719
he did test some and he was getting some

1589
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,440
that was like peeking out at like 22 23

1590
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,439
3% which was incredible for a land race

1591
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,119
but it had just been cultivated as a

1592
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,000
drug type for so long that was what they

1593
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,960
were pushing but most of them were in

1594
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,679
that like 16 to 18 area and [ __ ] they

1595
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,920
just rip you off your ass the the best

1596
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:13,399
thing lately has been the da meal Larry

1597
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,838
Chimes that we got from Dutch blooms um

1598
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,559
that's really been of that that's the

1599
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,599
only one that we've kept more than two

1600
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:21,960
fenos we kept four fenos of that one

1601
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,200
because it just had four really

1602
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:28,159
different bomb smells that were like

1603
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:31,078
unique enough to to to preserve and just

1604
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:33,118
really good depth of of tpping profile

1605
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,119
it has like six or seven or eight

1606
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,440
different notes and it it's not just one

1607
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,838
flavor it's like you're sitting there

1608
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,280
trying to like analyze all the flavors

1609
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,519
that are in your mouth right now and

1610
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,920
those are hard to find yeah definitely

1611
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:48,000
especially with a lot of the ball

1612
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,880
necking that's going on right now what

1613
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,599
do you feel like the future of land

1614
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,318
races is I mean saying that you know

1615
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,200
most land races now now are trash

1616
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:59,558
they're going back to hemp with the open

1617
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:01,399
pollinating there's High Herm rates a

1618
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:03,640
lot of them are contaminated do you

1619
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,960
think there is a future for preservation

1620
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:09,719
of landre strains as pure strains or do

1621
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,798
you think that cannabis is pushing in

1622
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,759
such a direction forward that it's kind

1623
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:15,960
of becoming obsolete to me I kind of

1624
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,720
look at them like U they're like the

1625
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,039
paint that like Bob Ross uses to to make

1626
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,279
a painting right like you need to have

1627
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:24,920
the good base color paints with the base

1628
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,640
colors that you need to make make the

1629
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,599
painting and the Blends and the things

1630
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,960
that you need right so if we don't have

1631
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:33,079
those base colors we can't make the

1632
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,000
happy little trees and the mountains and

1633
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:36,960
you know all that stuff it just won't

1634
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,760
work right you can't get the color right

1635
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,720
so I think that preserving them from a

1636
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,520
point of like Hey we're not going to use

1637
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:45,959
these as like f1s we're going to use

1638
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,480
them as breed stock but maintaining them

1639
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,559
as breed stock stuff I think is

1640
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,159
certainly important um I honestly I

1641
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,039
think in 40 or 50 years there is going

1642
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:55,519
to be a whole hell a lot left because

1643
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:57,640
people are kind of scraping the Earth

1644
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:00,239
for what's left right now

1645
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:01,519
and you know also these other markets

1646
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,038
cannabis is becoming more and more

1647
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,599
legalized you're getting more and more

1648
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,520
access to Western genetics in a lot of

1649
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:09,119
these remote areas and uh that's going

1650
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:11,079
to further you know diminish that you

1651
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,720
know for the good or the worst but a lot

1652
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,760
of the western stuff just fries I mean

1653
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,239
[ __ ] you take any indicia and you put it

1654
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,880
out here in full sun it'll melt you know

1655
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:20,519
any of the almost all the blueberry

1656
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,880
stuff except for the blueberry OG that

1657
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:24,038
we grew melts in the sun here and and a

1658
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,240
lot of stuff you don't put it under

1659
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:28,920
sunshade it'll just just like melt you

1660
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:30,838
know 60% of the stuff in the west that

1661
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,760
you grow indoor can't handle the sun

1662
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:34,838
here just won't won't handle it so um

1663
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,039
you know a lot of the stuff I think

1664
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:38,599
people are also breeding is super weak

1665
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,640
and I could see them just breeding to

1666
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:43,079
the point where everything is so fragile

1667
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,759
especially on the indoor side that like

1668
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:47,760
it just becomes extremely hard just to

1669
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,200
do production so I don't know we'll see

1670
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,119
what happens extrem heat that we're

1671
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,318
talking about what would be the the

1672
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:57,079
conversion rate on temperature so it's

1673
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:59,278
107 here during the day pretty regularly

1674
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:01,000
um and then you know Tropical Sun is

1675
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:03,440
much hotter in terms of how much it's

1676
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,599
heating the leaf surface and uh it just

1677
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,559
plows through the water in the plants

1678
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,160
and if you don't what are you using

1679
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:11,079
anything wide Leaf just doesn't work we

1680
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:13,118
use sun shades we have 50% sun shades

1681
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:15,160
that come on at about 10 o'clock 9:30 10

1682
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,000
o'clock in the morning uh and then they

1683
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:18,159
they roll back at about 3:30 4 o'clock

1684
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,880
depending on the

1685
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:23,078
temperature and then uh that helps

1686
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,480
Shield them from the worst of it and

1687
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:27,079
then you know you trash the strains that

1688
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,400
don't like it a lot of stuff will Auto

1689
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:31,920
flower so we've had another six or eight

1690
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,838
strains that just instantly went to

1691
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:38,720
flower as soon as they

1692
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:41,838
uh you know were in veg Beyond you know

1693
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:44,558
a month or two I imagine that uh

1694
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:47,639
circulation air would be a huge priority

1695
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,440
as well yeah yeah know having extra fans

1696
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,960
is another key thing every single pole

1697
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,760
in the greenhouse has a fan on it you

1698
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,119
can't go every other um you know with

1699
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,480
the uh with the fans because it's simply

1700
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:59,278
too hot you got to keep the air moving

1701
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,480
but the other bit of it is too we're in

1702
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:04,519
rice fields right so if you have a

1703
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,760
normal you know right now it's the end

1704
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,318
of the dried season but during the wet

1705
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,079
season like the other half of the year

1706
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,960
it's a lake around us all every

1707
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:16,720
direction is water you know it's you

1708
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,480
know knee knee deep in water so you have

1709
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,838
to have that air movement for mold right

1710
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,838
if you don't have good air movement

1711
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,519
those plants will rot same thing with

1712
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:25,278
you can't have like God buds not going

1713
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,920
to work here right can't do big giant

1714
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:29,920
dense colas uh or super dense like

1715
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,358
Afghan stuff it's just not going to do

1716
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,119
here well here because it's going to rot

1717
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:36,038
right you got to have stuff that's

1718
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,440
either small or slightly fluffy in order

1719
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:40,640
to um actually finish the the run off

1720
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,960
otherwise everything melt the other

1721
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:44,639
thing you get here is uh so like the

1722
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,798
leaves will cook off and you'll get kind

1723
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,960
of the Browning on the ends of the

1724
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:49,880
leaves from being too dry not replacing

1725
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,679
the water fast enough and then there's a

1726
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,160
mold that'll start to attack those and

1727
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,318
then it'll go back into the bud too

1728
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:57,519
which I've never seen that before for uh

1729
01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:58,838
except for here so um you know you got

1730
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,278
all kinds of stuff that you have to

1731
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:03,558
mitigate constantly um on that and again

1732
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:05,079
that just comes down to being proactive

1733
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:08,119
you spray the plants every other day

1734
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:10,000
with either an insect spray uh and then

1735
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:12,278
a day off or so you know Monday you

1736
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,798
spray for insects day off Wednesday you

1737
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:16,318
spray for mold day off you know Friday

1738
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:18,960
you spray for insects again and you just

1739
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:21,440
rinse repeat so that seems to keep

1740
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,838
everything at Bay um in terms of that we

1741
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,480
also use wood vinegar which is something

1742
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:25,798
I wanted to bring up you don't hear

1743
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,358
anybody use that in the states I don't

1744
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:30,679
even know if it's allowed in the States

1745
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:34,318
but it's just basically vinegar that's

1746
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:36,440
been um they take uh like mosquite and

1747
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:39,519
they run mosquite through a giant vat of

1748
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,798
vinegar almost like a bong and it like U

1749
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,880
flavors the vinegar to smell like wood

1750
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:46,038
smoke and we spray that on the plants

1751
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,640
and it the bugs hate that [ __ ] and it it

1752
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:51,160
gives the plants like a Vigor like the

1753
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:53,000
plants really like the the different

1754
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:54,838
compounds that are within the vinegar

1755
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,559
and it they def they're Greener they're

1756
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:59,159
all preying the next day like the plants

1757
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,519
are very happy when you spray that on it

1758
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:02,159
um and the bugs hate it and that's

1759
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:03,639
something that we use everybody in

1760
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,639
Thailand use that's like a standard

1761
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:07,078
practice Agricultural Product that you

1762
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:08,558
know the mites don't like it the white

1763
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:10,119
flies don't like it like it's just good

1764
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,119
for keeping everything off the plants

1765
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:13,680
more as a preventative than a treatment

1766
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:15,599
but if you're regularly applying it it

1767
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,118
helps kind of keep the bugs out and um

1768
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,559
just something I was kind of curious and

1769
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,519
I'd love to talk to an agricultural

1770
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,599
expert at some point on why we don't

1771
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:24,239
have an equivalent product in the US the

1772
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:26,318
other thing that's pretty unique about

1773
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:29,318
Thailand is that so in the United States

1774
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:31,199
you you have to have single um single

1775
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:34,239
agent bio controls so you have to have

1776
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:35,679
just Bia balana or just meisum or just

1777
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:39,038
iseria

1778
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:40,639
fumer or what's it Corps fumer now I

1779
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,760
guess they just changed the name of it

1780
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:45,798
um yeah uh in Thailand you can have

1781
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,640
multiple ones we we actually our main

1782
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:51,759
product is aaria basana metum uh comp

1783
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:55,759
the two of them are premixed together we

1784
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,079
mix that with um beus uh agentus BT uh

1785
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,000
and that gives us a really good

1786
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:00,720
broadspectrum three in one control that

1787
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,079
we can apply in one shot you know one

1788
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,439
labor one one labor payment and

1789
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:06,119
everything has been spreaded with three

1790
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,079
different types of Bio controls which is

1791
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:09,358
great and they don't have any kind of

1792
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,119
negative impact on each other's

1793
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:12,920
populations an

1794
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,318
application um you can't do that in

1795
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,798
United States in fact I don't even know

1796
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,278
if you could legally do it as an

1797
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:19,719
application on a on a you know monitor

1798
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:20,639
crop you know because they want to see

1799
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:23,639
that

1800
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,318
individual uh activated bio control for

1801
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:26,719
whatever crazy reason same way that like

1802
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:28,480
the US is stuck on monomolecular

1803
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,239
pharmacology you know they don't want

1804
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,480
compound medicine is a huge pain in the

1805
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,519
ass in the United States especially if

1806
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,240
you're trying to get anything approved

1807
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:37,079
um you know it's why you can't it's so

1808
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:39,278
hard to get like cannabis plus a turpine

1809
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,720
even though we know damn well lenol plus

1810
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:44,278
CBD plus THC suppress seizures in

1811
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:46,399
children the FDA want to prove that

1812
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:48,639
because they want to see that linol is

1813
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,358
safe and does it for children and that

1814
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:52,798
THC does it and a safe for children and

1815
01:06:50,358 --> 01:06:55,078
CBD does it as safe for children well no

1816
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:57,559
the combination of them gets rid of the

1817
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:59,359
psychoactivity of the THC and suppresses

1818
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:01,880
the seizures but you have to make all

1819
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:04,038
three together you can't certifying them

1820
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,039
individually it doesn't you know the

1821
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:07,760
parts don't don't equal the sum of the

1822
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:10,440
the total combin

1823
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,960
so you can't get the drug approved that

1824
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,838
stop seizures and children which is

1825
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,318
[ __ ] crazy right like that's [ __ ]

1826
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:18,078
Loco like anything that gets in the way

1827
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,759
of that should be like just obliterate

1828
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,440
it you should immed in the same way we

1829
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,640
will flood every gas station with

1830
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,159
non-effective CBD derivative oh yeah and

1831
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,759
Delta 8 and uh don't forget about all

1832
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:31,719
the all the noo caffeine that causes

1833
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,440
over 18,000 accidents a year that they

1834
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:36,159
never [ __ ] bring up like why are we

1835
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,760
not regulating that like you know we

1836
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,239
could talk about statistics on what's

1837
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,799
killing people in the US and it's not

1838
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:43,439
the

1839
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,038
weed uh is there anything that anybody

1840
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,159
that you'd like to shout out before we

1841
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,920
get going sure yeah if anybody wants to

1842
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:53,558
to check me out we have the DAT smoke

1843
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:56,119
show on Wednesday evenings um us time at

1844
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:57,200
uh usually around 7:30 Pacific sometimes

1845
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:59,640
a little earlier sometimes a little

1846
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:01,598
later um and that's over at dat smoke

1847
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,838
show dat smoke show and that's more of a

1848
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,318
fun laid-back hang out with a bunch of

1849
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,199
other Growers a lot of Thai people are

1850
01:08:05,318 --> 01:08:10,038
around there that are growing here it's

1851
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,000
a really fun looser you know less formal

1852
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:13,160
show and then I have the growing with

1853
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,798
fishes podcast on Thursday evenings it's

1854
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:17,358
much more formal more of an interview

1855
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:18,960
style or a grow topic Centric you know

1856
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,079
we're going to talk about this today and

1857
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:24,079
go through that similar to this show uh

1858
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:25,880
where it's it's much more focused um you

1859
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:28,079
guys can also check out uh the growing

1860
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,359
officies podcast on all platforms that

1861
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:31,600
are available out there same thing with

1862
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,039
that smoke show it's on all those uh and

1863
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,920
you can find out any of my educational

1864
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,479
courses over at apj class.com or the

1865
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,158
pest class.com if you want to take

1866
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:41,919
formal class-based education I also run

1867
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,639
the open nutrient project which is an

1868
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,079
open source Pro program that we're

1869
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:48,880
working on that I've put together by

1870
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:50,278
myself on um how to open source a lot of

1871
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,279
the stuff because a lot of the crean

1872
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,400
natural farming people uh don't really

1873
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:55,759
have a good idea of the nutrient um

1874
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,719
profile and what it is they're creating

1875
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,000
with those inputs a lot of the soil food

1876
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:00,838
web people don't really know what the

1877
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,920
nutrient profile is what their inputs

1878
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,679
are and they've kind of ignored that

1879
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,880
nutrient component of the balance and I

1880
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:08,640
feel like that's a kind of a big thing

1881
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,880
that needs to be addressed because you

1882
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,359
can absolutely make a bad compost mix

1883
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,319
right that doesn't have what the plants

1884
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:16,199
need pretty easily if you don't know

1885
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,279
what plants you need so the idea is to

1886
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:19,838
create a centralized database streamline

1887
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,080
a lot of the work that like Dr Duke's

1888
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:23,039
database has and some of the other

1889
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:24,798
things for getting the mineral content

1890
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:28,319
of these different inputs and input

1891
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:30,238
plants and input minerals into one place

1892
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,759
with one list of testing so that you

1893
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,718
guys can go okay I'm going to pick these

1894
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,158
plants for my property I'm going to pick

1895
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:38,520
these test kits to test for testing it

1896
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:40,119
and then I can test my own inputs at my

1897
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,520
own house or my own Farm without having

1898
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:44,039
to rely on third parties and that that

1899
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,839
you know so trying to give the power

1900
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:47,198
back to the farmer give the knowledge

1901
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:50,198
back to the farmer so they can create

1902
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,559
their own inputs with actual knowledge

1903
01:09:50,198 --> 01:09:53,358
on what it's going to look like on a

1904
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,199
nutrient profile on the back end be it

1905
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,400
natural farming knf jadam or whatever

1906
01:09:56,198 --> 01:10:00,799
else also has links to preparations uh

1907
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:02,319
and you can submit your own parts per

1908
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,199
million testing through that and there's

1909
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:05,799
an open source database that has what

1910
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,238
other people have created uh their

1911
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,960
recipes and um you know what nutrient

1912
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,319
profiles they found with their ferments

1913
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,679
ands and other inputs so um it's kind of

1914
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,439
trying to drive this um you know more

1915
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:17,960
open- Source data stuff to take it away

1916
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:19,198
from some of the Monsanto and other

1917
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,679
people because that was one of the big

1918
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,559
things I've seen traveling the world is

1919
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:24,440
that we could totally solve a lot of

1920
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,440
these Farmers problems get them off of

1921
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:27,759
this ferti a fertilizer addiction and

1922
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:29,839
onto something they can create on their

1923
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,320
farms and these farmers are super rich

1924
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,159
in natural resources they just don't

1925
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:35,158
know how to convert them into fertilizer

1926
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:37,000
so if we can just fix that Gap and

1927
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:39,279
translate it into many languages you

1928
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,760
could have a really big impact on fixing

1929
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,759
a lot of the stuff that the fertilizer

1930
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:46,000
companies are breaking right now

1931
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:48,119
gigantic absolutely that's exactly what

1932
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,439
got me into Korean natural farming I

1933
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:51,000
don't know if you've heard me speak on

1934
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,799
it before but I grew up in an

1935
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:57,399
agriculture more of a fruit farm uh

1936
01:10:53,800 --> 01:11:00,560
apples chairs pears cherries um apricot

1937
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:03,399
all kinds of different stuff and seeing

1938
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:07,120
the chemicals that they were required to

1939
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:09,039
spray on a constant schedule and the

1940
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,399
ground's just looking worse and worse

1941
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:14,000
and it's getting Compact and Barren and

1942
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:15,920
nothing lives there and it's just like

1943
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,479
there's got to be a better cheaper way

1944
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,960
than this especially if you're using you

1945
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:24,158
know really expensive fertilizers like

1946
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:27,560
that that are 90% water looting them

1947
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:30,119
down further killing your microbiome and

1948
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,120
then expecting awesome results you know

1949
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:34,119
and then if you do have a [ __ ] crop then

1950
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:37,238
you paid a bunch on those that different

1951
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:38,920
nutrient spray schedule that IPM and

1952
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:42,039
you're out a ton of money because your

1953
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,800
crop sucked as well and it shouldn't be

1954
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:47,079
like that there you should you should be

1955
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:49,920
able to grow good tasting organic weed

1956
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:52,559
for pennies on the dollar and you should

1957
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,760
have fun doing it and it often doesn't

1958
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,440
have any flavor because there's no

1959
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,440
microbes to stimulate the flavonoid and

1960
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,960
turpine production in the root system so

1961
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,198
the plants taste like cardboard when

1962
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,439
they grow them that way too you know we

1963
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,119
are definitely talk more about that if

1964
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,198
we can get you on for another pod

1965
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,519
podcast I'd love to have you on again I

1966
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,799
know that you said you had a bunch of

1967
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,520
new methods that you're doing with k&amp;f I

1968
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,039
just I've been doing the basics that

1969
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,920
I've learned from Chris um so it'd be

1970
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,639
really cool to Deep dive into that with

1971

1975
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,159
