47
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,679
least 10 degrees above our norm

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,640
but we're thawing out

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,960
and uh it's kind of floody icy we have

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,879
you know quite a bit of snowpack about

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,640
four pound four feet of snowpack or

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,759
something that was there

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
so uh lights coming back but it's a it's

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,200
pretty bad

55
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,478
right now for weather we call it break

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,719

59
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,280
happening a little early

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,199
good deal it's it's good for our tourism

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,199
industry the only thing you can do in

62
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,000
the winter up here

63
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,519
is called for a rendezvous and it's uh

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,639
you know old-time

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
per

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,878
crater celebration thing that turned

67
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,959
into a modern day events and

68
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,719
it's going on starting tonight for the

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
next two weeks and it's like they have

70
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,800
dog mushing races so much crap goes on

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
but it's uh

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,400
on the first saturday and march is the

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,719
iditarod so this kind of kicks off the

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
old dog mushing thing there's a lot of

75
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,959
sprint races but they do sit where's not

76
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,318
there's not a lot to do in alaska in

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
anchorage in the winter especially you

78

lots of skiing and uh

81
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,000
[ __ ] like that and uh

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840

86
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,719
fools all run down our main fifth avenue

87
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,878
uh downtown

88
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,878

with reindeer

90
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,439
pretty uh comical all of the little [ __ ]

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
that's going on but yeah that's

92
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,680
kind of wild timing did it happen

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
we're interviewing today and have a big

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,879
fireworks and

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,000
i think we're just pretty boring so

96
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,560
that's our big snow bowling eye

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
yeah snow blowing yeah they clear

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,360
through the ice of uh all the snow and

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
ice bowling they call it

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
what are they bowling with

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,439
no just regular bowling pins and bowling

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
balls it's just on ice out on a lake

103
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,239
right at one of the main establishments

104
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,519
here in town one of the big

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
bar

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,039
a sports bar kind of big sports bar

107
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,639
place doesn't

108
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,199
there's little events all over like that

109
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,759
but we're we're that po down um that's

110
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,158
our big deal there's people that do come

111
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,759
tourism wise people always want to visit

112
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,359
the winter if you didn't come this

113
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,719
weekend or this and there's a big snow

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
sculpture

115
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,319
uh competition too which is that is

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,560
pretty cool there's some real good

117
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,279
sculptures but if you didn't come this

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,800
two weeks or three weeks in the winter

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,079
it's pretty damn dark and cold with

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
nothing to do unless you just have a

121
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,680
friend that has a cabin

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
in the middle of nowhere and good snow

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,918
machines and then you can go just tear

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
it up or you you know if you're

125
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,478
targeting a skiing or something like

126
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
that that's that's an attraction but

127
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,800
other than that

128
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,000
there's

129
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,079
i don't even remember we had any

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
concerts this whole year they don't send

131
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,918
us a whole lot

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
it's [ __ ] yeah it's been kind of an

133
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,240
off couple years anyway that's cool

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
though yeah thanks for doing that on a

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
normal year

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,960
we get the least out of anybody on the

137
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,638
normal year so

138
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,399
right right there's a lot of live music

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,639
events going on over right the next two

140
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,959
weeks too and a couple good comedy guys

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,400
come up here they're all targeting this

142
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,319
whatever tours of money is available

143
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,638
but yeah we all get a we get a sense of

144
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,639
relief all alaskans this is like

145
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,079
we realized about

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
about uh

147
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,000
valentine's day

148
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,439
most alaskans see the difference in

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,959
light coming back because we started

150
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,319
gaining about

151
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,319
four

152
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,879
three or four minutes a day by then five

153
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,879
minutes a day almost coming back so

154
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,038
you kind of get a different attitude and

155
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,439
see a review of

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,519
the sun coming back it's like a renewal

157
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,360
of life in the new season and after the

158
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,639
last two years

159
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
everybody

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,360

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,759
it's going to be like a brand new fresh

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,919
year and nice this year

163
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,240

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120

170
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,360
they have massive restrictions the town

171
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,520
has a tunnel to get into that's like the

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,038
longest tunnel in north america and yet

173
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,198
they built it in the 40s army corps of

174
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,360
engineer did it for army purposes but

175
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,759
there's a fuel depot over there all the

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
fuel and anchorage come through that

177
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,560
and

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
they closed down a lot of restrictions

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
and it included the launch that i went

180
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,120
to you had to have a

181
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,638
covered pass to be able to go into the

182
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
industrial part of the town which is

183
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
where all the fish processing is and

184
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
they had these you know the fall meat

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,399
houses and fish crossing around america

186
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,439
was really getting

187
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,959
uh infected on that first wave and there

188
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,279
was hundreds of people sick and they

189
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,680
couldn't take a chance of losing the

190
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,318
fish industry on all these salmon that

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
was coming in so they basically blocked

192
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
the town and i didn't get to go fishing

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,439
i didn't go i didn't go at all and last

194
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,079
year i tried to catch up and

195
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,160
things gotten away you know last year i

196
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,000

197
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,800
the way i kept [ __ ] shrimp puller

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,279

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,400
bumps i do have more maintenance than

200
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,079
fishing

201
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,239

like wanting to go jump in the boat and

232
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,560
if it was i know if it was you sure we

233
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,478
just probably went to the cannabis cup

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
for about eight hours and spent about 40

235
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,079
hours on the water you wouldn't have

236
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,520
even had to tell me twice i'd just jump

237
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,680
in that [ __ ] oh yeah i could do that

238
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,598

246
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
with that you know

247
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
yeah our events up here aren't quite

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
like

249
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,278
the ones i've been to i've been able to

250
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,598
i didn't go to a lot but i was able to

251
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,120
go to a couple high times and

252
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
the san bernardino south southern

253
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,839
california was pretty

254
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,239
pretty wild event every big uh

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,000
vendor was there and

256
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,919
uh you know how they are the big big

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
shows was great that's crazy that was

258
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,719
almost like a i guess that's in between

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,720
or near coachella and all the other like

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,440
what was the chalice and all that you

261
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
know so those people are like geared up

262
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,680
i mean it's not our style up here

263
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:12,319
like five speeds lower up here

264
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:15,120
speaking about being geared up let's get

265
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,879
on some cannabis talk here you i was

266
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,399
talking to you yesterday and you said

267
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,320
you wanted to talk about some of the

268
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,799
original sssc

269
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,440
trains that you're working with

270
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,719
yeah that is uh something that people

271
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
hadn't

272
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,639
i guess there was a void of it for a lot

273
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,080
of time and

274
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,319
tried uh

275
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,959
genetics were dried up or missing and i

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
know there are a couple of real

277
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,518
uh

278
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,439
cuts around of some of the original

279
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,440
stuff and people were wanting it but uh

280
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,800
one of the things that i was able to

281
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,279
bring back a few of the strains a friend

282
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,159
of mine who was a big preserver of that

283
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,679
uh original drops of both

284
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,879
seed bank of poland and the sssc

285
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,359
he's uh

286
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,439
he was collecting just about everything

287
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,519
there was and

288
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
he'd grow a little bit of it but froze

289
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,639
all of it

290
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,959
and uh would take it out and

291
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,439
check it out or reproduce it one

292
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,000
forward generation and put it back up

293
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,839
properly and freeze it

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,159
through

295
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,839
uh through a younger guy uh

296
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,159
blue pass skunk board he's on ig he was

297
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
friends with this older guy

298
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,240
or had met him through the forums which

299
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,600
i wasn't involved in at all i hardly

300
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,039
ever ever got on forums or

301
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
i didn't really want to deal with that

302
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,159
but uh i'd work a little bit and check

303
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
stuff out but he was offering it

304
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,120
years ago

305
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,319
i don't know i went back and did find

306
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
old posts

307
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,360
he went by old detroit on some of the

308
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,119
forms i forgot if it was ic mag or

309
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
whatever but they they come up if you

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,440
search them and he was offering people

311
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
the original ssd

312
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
right out of the manila packs just years

313
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
ago and nobody

314
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,159
you look at the thread

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
it wouldn't it wouldn't even go nowhere

316
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,439
nobody was taking them up on it they

317
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,240
were just like their offer was out there

318
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,800
and

319
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,399
people just probably thought it was fake

320
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,078
i don't know about that maybe it's just

321
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,919
like

322
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,278
not enough knowledge about it it's just

323
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,599
hard to believe why there wasn't or

324
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,360
there wasn't some kind of

325
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
want i know you gave it to a couple guys

326
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,879
maybe a few of them i think for even the

327
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,480
people that are interested there's a

328
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,838
certain amount of skepticism when

329
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,680
genetics have been gone that long you

330
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,680
know the real deal it could have been a

331
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,199
buried thread that wasn't popular to you

332
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,958
the threats that you come up when you

333
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
google them

334
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,039
i don't know how that i'm not

335
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,159
super familiar with you know how the

336
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,879
that whole

337
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,480
system worked i just like get on find a

338
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,639
little bit of information and then go

339
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,639
away again and uh

340
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,879
but he did have a lot of strains and

341
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,399
then he had offered williams wonder and

342
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,838
beatrix choice and m48 which was uh

343
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,600
m48 was the last thing that ssc

344
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,200
ssc had produced they did have some

345
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,079
unreleased strains

346
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
that went higher than that number of m48

347
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,759
and they never did hit the market so

348
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,719
there are people that did get those and

349
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,159
it is even available and around today

350
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,720
i know of another person that has an

351
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,278
entire collection of sssc2 and they're

352
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,120

i

376

377
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,519
through

378
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,560

379
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,200
daz at mafesto got a hold of his buddy

380
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,599
in europe who runs that side of it

381
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680

they hang out

383
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,199
and i had them

384
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,919
i asked if i could reproduce because uh

385
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,160
there was copyrighted

386
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,479
issues that i had gotten a hold of i

387
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,879
asked if i could reproduce them and get

388
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,800
them back to him and he gave me full

389
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,480
permission to

390
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,240
go ahead and do it so i went and made

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,440
some real high quality reproductions of

392
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,120

explanation of business first year in

414
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,480
business how the success is doing what

415
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,000
lines are coming and they'd have a

416
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,278
little list of what the available

417
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,879
genetics were

418
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,879
the next year in 86

419
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,480
they like hybridized it almost made a

420
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,240
catalog they actually made that you know

421
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,278
seed bank did make the catalog neville

422
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,278
made actual catalog in 86 and then uh

423
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,600
the first uh real catalog for sss is 87

424
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,240
and then i had those uh

425
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,199
i had those all the way through like 91

426
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,360
90

427
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,958
i think is the last one that i had

428
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
whatever it is but there's they're like

429
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,119
books they put in a ton of information

430
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,919
for grow information that's very very

431
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
very technical and there's about

432
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,599
15 pages of information on there from

433
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,000
everything from step one to end product

434
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,159
i mean and it's got cool vintage [ __ ]

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,320
like sea of green 144 cuts at a time of

436
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,559
one single strain and

437
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
it's got a ton of cool information

438
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,119
but uh

439
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
the

440
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
m48

441
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,198
is

442
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,880
the last one on that whole list and it

443
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:39,039
was a supplemental flyer it had i think

444
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,799
uh

445
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,039
i'm sitting right around here i could go

446
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:47,679
look at a little flyer that had the m48

447
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,679
on one m47 was i think uh

448
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,479
what is it

449
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,639
m47

450
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
is how many glasses do you see what it

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,600
says

452
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,679
uh super indoor sativa nm47

453
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
and that was on the flyer with that m48

454
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,638
the haze south african

455
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,120
and they had m46 was on that flyer too

456
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,480
super indoor indica

457
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,159
that you know

458
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
these are a little bit of things that

459
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,838
people don't really know unless you

460
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,278
bought those and the super indoor indica

461
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,959
looks exactly like afghani one and they

462
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,360
originally were

463
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:27,278
offering that afghani one it had the

464
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,759
branded sacred seeds uh logos and [ __ ]

465
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,919
right on it but but so did the

466
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,600
other producers at the time uh neville

467
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,198
did the same thing all of the first

468
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
catalogs were all branded with the

469
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,359
sacred seed stuff

470
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,879
because that skunk one and from

471
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,480
cultivator's choice

472
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,159
i made about 16 i ended up with like 16

473
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,000
of them bodhi

474
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,719
cody's friend

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,958
i mean i met bodhi and got lucky and met

476
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
this guy down in emerald or something i

477
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,198
don't think i'd ever contacted him prior

478
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
to that and uh

479
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,799
i think i had these catalogs and i

480
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,319
gifted him so many uh

481
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,720
maybe a couple of them or something i

482
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,279
don't even remember just like it wasn't

483
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,279
a major deal but he had the his friends

484
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,240
a photographer for the 1990

485
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,199
1985

486
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,318
uh catalog where neville goes and visits

487
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
the hash factories in the tiber pass and

488
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,639
it's all the front cover of it is the

489
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
the actual guys you know shows them

490
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,439
holding the afghan

491
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,960

492
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,519

493
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,319
pretty wicked looking water pipe and uh

494
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,679
and his buddy did the

495
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,918
it wasn't touring a little bit too

496
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
it's very great information but his

497
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,799
buddy did all the photography work and

498
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,919
had like a dozen original uncirculated

499
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,279
copies of that seed bank catalog and i

500
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,038
was uh

501
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,798
i was blown away somebody would have

502
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:59,679
originals he gives me an original and uh

503
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,798
he had about

504
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,440
four others i think

505
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,240
and um i asked if i could copy him and

506
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,759
he is on his way to just a

507
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,480
few years back he was on his way to

508
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,240
mexico to do that land race hunt i think

509
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,038
i forgot who he was going with but they

510
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,160
were all geared up to go to um

511
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,919
mexico and regional areas to

512
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,000
find a bunch of real good stuff i think

513
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
that's when he brought back the mia that

514
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,400

515
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,160

518
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,519

519
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,959

524
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,759

reposted that information

554
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,640

for me

565
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200

00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,879
incarnation of how the catalogs could go

572

through a couple of them but back when

577
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,599
those came out i was more of a consumer

578
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,759
than interested in growing or breeding

579
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,639
like anything like that i got a handle

580
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,079

581
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,880

1988 seed bank of holland magazine

583

666
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,960
around with but uh

667
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,120
i wanted you know some nl2 ish kind of

668
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,519
stuff but he sent me like nl2 and

669
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:13,278
lowrider original stuff and uh oh man

670
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,679
it's really cool but he told me it was

671
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,079
going to trigger at

672
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
16 hours and should finish you know

673
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,278
because

674
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,840
where he's at it would do this so

675
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,440
he's just so much off of our system in

676
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,480
our life so

677
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,159
we uh

678
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,640
and i've grown it outside it's getting

679
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
killer and beautiful and come down to 18

680
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,720
hours was getting excited no sexing at

681
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,119
all not at all and then 16 hours come

682
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,519
down and no sexing at all

683
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,918
man 14 hours come down and no sexing at

684
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,000
all and it's turning dark and getting

685
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,840
purple because our weather is already 40

686
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,200
degrees and going downhill quick the day

687
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,278
that we hit uh about 13 hours where a

688
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,480
plant will trigger it's already freezing

689
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,640
so

690
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,919
i'm looking at these things and it it

691
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,159
was a late on come for fall so i just

692
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,480
left them out and there it is about 13

693
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,480
hours he's [ __ ] near auto half auto

694
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,558
from pure low rider find the trigger

695
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,919
i've seen the first males and females

696
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,278
and then i had to move them inside to

697
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,240
finish them

698
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,519
so it's not a uh it's not a photo auto

699
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,599
usable thing that's what we're kind of

700
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,158
targeting for autos up here don't work

701
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,359
uh real well outdoors

702
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,919
the weather is just way too harsh 90 or

703
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,639
or not uh you know weather resistant

704
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,480
they have arthritis or asparagus or any

705
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
of the natural fungus or molds are going

706
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
to hit them and just

707
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,399
they're done and the rain will win

708
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,240
if you got to grow them you know

709
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,000
in an open

710
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,038
there's a lot of like things that aren't

711
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,119
going to work you don't have like this

712
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,319
have you tried any of the original like

713
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,639
siberian root or alice well um

714
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,359
yeah from neville's original stuff in

715
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,278
1990 we did grow they were

716
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,798
they were way harder and did finish and

717
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,640
then you'd get a hybrid

718
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,558
one and four just like skunk or pure

719
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
indica like that he had crossed them to

720
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,678
but they were smoking like cardboard it

721
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,080
was super high cbd cvn

722
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,440
and it just like the uh there's very

723
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,278
valuable [ __ ] now because that's the

724
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
meds i've got some if you want it i'm

725
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,759
circulating

726
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
i don't have uh i've got a ton of them

727
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,480
in old

728
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,199
uh

729
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,319
film canister the old 35 millimeter just

730
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
the ones that went in the freezer that's

731
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,158
how i froze

732
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,640
almost all of my old stock went to those

733
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,320
old 35 millimeter film canister but i i

734
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,240
have one and my partner has one and they

735
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:32,079
both just say rudy rudy's on it so we uh

736
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,000
we cracked it open and have gone into

737
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,000
multiple times it does just instantly

738
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
grow them single stocky

739
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,278
past

740
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,079
cardboard

741
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,079
um

742
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,079
it's it's interesting [ __ ] though

743
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,918
no not the none of them that have been

744
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:53,399
frozen they'll talk every time but

745
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,400
you're near 100.

746
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,000
he had a string of um

747
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,879
wicked tough

748
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,599
siberian cross [ __ ] from uh original

749
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,840
just the photos and the only photo that

750
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,558
neville

751
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:12,079
used that were not his own was from dee

752
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,319
and it was the photo in the 1990s

753
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,720
uh seed bank catalog and that was

754
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,000
advertising his uh root oralist hybrid

755
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,519
crosses

756
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,759
and that thing was uh a full a polar uh

757
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,798
polar graph from

758
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,879
e

759
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,158
so uh

760
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
it shows

761
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
just

762
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,278
at the back of the catalog shows a uh

763
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,359
let me see what the offering was i

764
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,079
thought it was the

765
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,879
[Music]

766
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:42,398
indica root or alice in it i think but

767
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,559
um he said he has the original stock

768
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,719
he had the original stock it's a

769
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,599
reuterella skunk and the picture shows

770
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,159
uh and it says it too rude or else

771
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:55,678
polaroid snapshot from canada but so

772
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,080
he's been growing this this exact stock

773
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,480
since 1980s

774
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:05,038
this is the 1999 1990 catalog and he

775
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,880
told me he had been inbreeding it and

776
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,119
just growing it and it finishes and

777
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,278
kicks ass and is potent and is good he

778
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,038
said originally it was just sleepy weed

779
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,480
but they had geared it now towards taste

780
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,558
effect

781
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,880
still got the super resistance and

782
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,119
durability and he said he was going to

783
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,278
send me some of it but he sent me about

784
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,798
10 other things and not that and then he

785
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,798
said he would resend it but i'd lost

786
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,759
contact with him

787
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,759
he disappeared off ig and i don't even

788
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,319
i don't know how the hell i guess we

789
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,960
were talking only on ig

790
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,720
but regardless he has the ruder ellis

791
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,399
and this the auto that might work up

792
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,480
here photo autos are the only thing that

793
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,918
do real well up here you can get

794
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,880
something like a

795
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,080
colombian photo auto with the fastest

796
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,799
best uh

797
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,759
indica it'll have the phosphitis

798
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,398
resistance and still finish it about

799
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,759
75 days

800
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,599
that's the thing you got to target if

801
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,038
you're going to do with that [ __ ] right

802
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,480
everybody does light yet but if you're

803
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,879
going outdoors up here there's only a

804
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,278
couple choices you know autos that don't

805
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,120
do well you can put a roof find like a

806
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,000
greenhouse with screened walls just

807
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,000
screen them in so it has ton of airflow

808
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,919
that'll finish your autos

809
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,159
or you um

810
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,440
everybody grows autos in here indoors

811
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,600
it's so [ __ ] silly 18 hours of light

812
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,880
indoors wasting all that time energy and

813
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:31,359
space yeah this crate crazy world

814
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,840
somebody's gonna get offended

815
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,319
uh no it's everybody can do their own

816
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,839
thing i'm not against any one form but

817
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,678
also one thing people do up here is

818
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,519
growing in the windowsill like if you

819
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,440
got a good sunny window that'll get you

820
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,398
by what's modeled so you can finish off

821
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
yeah

822
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,959
it works so it works pretty well because

823
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,480
we have the you know 18 and 20 hours of

824
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,880
sunlight and those things are just

825
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,679
jamming in your window

826
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,200
um

827
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,200
pretty impressive that's a good way but

828
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
they are you know so protected

829
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,399
environment of your house it's like your

830
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,320
house plant

831
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,319
right that's funny that's a good thing

832
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:08,158
about that auto triggering blueberry

833
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,839
that i have fast blueberry it uh it's

834
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
one of the lines of blueberry you have a

835
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,240
root restrictive root zone restriction

836
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,319
uh flowering response so if you just put

837
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,759
it in a solo cup all your males and

838
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,759
females

839
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,519
and you want to sex it

840
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,519
keep it in that solo cup and by the

841
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,480
third fourth week you're actually going

842
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,599
to see males showing and you can just

843
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,880
separate

844
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,439
it's not a dead locked in trait but it's

845
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,720
pretty damn accurate and pretty heavy so

846
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,640
that's interesting

847
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,319
you can almost just pull all your mails

848
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
if you want to kill them kill them if

849
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,839
you want to do you know keep man solos

850
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,278
put them somewhere else because they're

851
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,079
going to continue to flower at that

852
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:45,519
point

853
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,038
um you know do you just deal with them

854
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,038
but you know what your females are so

855
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,440
you just repot them up and you get these

856
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,038
just killer females and even if you want

857
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,278
a male you just repot it up it'll just

858
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,679
go back into full veg it won't be

859
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,558
blowing out balls everywhere that's good

860
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,360
but

861
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,440
outdoors it's about 10 days

862
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,479
it's weird the strains like a photo auto

863
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,720
it must be because if you don't uh shave

864
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,240
the legs completely strip it the auxins

865
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,798
are going to make this thing go into

866
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,558
flower but if you strip the legs and put

867
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,720
a huge root ball

868
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,599
root give it good root zone it's going

869
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,000
to go to full veg and veg only and just

870
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,398
be a regular 100 normal plant but if you

871
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,319
want to root bind a good female

872
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,158
you can put it in your window seal

873
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,720
and it'll act like an auto so you'll get

874
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,159
a very nice tight smokeable killer

875
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,798
blueberry and you can smell the thing

876
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,200
growing the whole time um they make a

877
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,519
house plant an auto house plant so the

878
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
fast blueberry is really an indian it's

879
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,599
an interesting screen

880
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,558
and it triggers outdoor maybe 10 days

881
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,719
faster than your regular

882
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,038
outdoor blueberries which finish fast

883
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
anyway but this little

884
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:53,759
people have told me they finish it in

885
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,519
like

886
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,440
middle of september and they can get it

887
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
done before october weather starts to

888
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,880
hit so

889
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,799
wow that's really important that's good

890
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,799
area that's oh yeah that's a really good

891
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,759
thing up here

892
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,440
or hybrid i heard that the iranian autos

893
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,359
were like that too i don't know if it's

894
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,600
in the genetics or if it was just got a

895
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,599
little bit of the

896
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,000
you know the auto root oralist type of

897
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,639
genetics in it or i know there's there's

898
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,480
probably about 10 variations of

899
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:28,480
cannabis between the chinese the

900
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,640
you know root or alice's the sativas and

901
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,960
then there's gonna be

902
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,120
through evolution i think they have made

903
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,960
photo autos of their own which are just

904
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,719
a slight degree

905
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,720
the expressions i would agree with that

906
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,720
definitely they lean in one way or the

907
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,399
other you know your expressions will

908
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,839
tell you that i mean i've been asked by

909
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,239
some pretty

910
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,398
thoughtful people they're just like

911
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
they're like putting a lot of thoughts

912
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,839
in their head and they tell me that they

913
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,720
actually think that cannabis is a

914
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,639
perennial because it is one that

915
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,278
you can grow forever

916
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,960
it could be biennial annual or or

917
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,720
perennial and it's thought to be the

918
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,679
only

919
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,079
annual in the world out of 6 000 annuals

920
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,399
that has a male and a female to it minus

921
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,798
the fact that i think a radish

922
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:18,000
is very similar

923
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:20,000
and um i know ed rosenthal had uh

924
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,359
brought up some stuff on that that that

925
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,558
cannabis

926
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,759
is not the only out of 6 000 but other

927
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,398
people have

928
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,398
argued that that's not true so i don't

929
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,959
want to get into that [ __ ] cannabis is

930
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,119
very very special for the fact that

931
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,000
out of every annual you think about it

932
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,398
they're they're all asexual and cannabis

933
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,519
is like that one expression alone and

934
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,359
then you

935
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,960
look at all the different uh lines

936
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,879
through thousands of years that have

937
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,759
come down for whatever purpose they were

938
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,679
using it for uh so they've and

939
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,519
regionally too it's one of the best

940
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,000
things in the world cannabis is it's got

941
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,919
every single expression and then

942
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,319
through development this can it's going

943
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,720
to go to crazy places i think that was

944
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:05,439
undeveloped natural occurrences

945
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,278
happening to do what it does right now

946
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,960
very little human intervention you know

947
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,239
we just now hit the same humans

948
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,800
that weed has been around they have

949
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,838
prehistoric [ __ ] you know marijuana

950
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,399
[ __ ]

951
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,398
fossils

952
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,800
you got my mind rolling here thinking

953
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,119
about all this weird [ __ ] with our you

954
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,720
know our our 20 hours of light up here

955
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,039
it's so hard to

956
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,480
we don't get a fair chance on

957
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,320
you know america they all have these

958
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,079
plants they get them vegged out make

959
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,320
them to huge bushes and baby them and

960
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,560
put them in you know 600 gallon pots or

961
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
in real outdoor ground or

962
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,878
whatever the case and then it starts to

963
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,759
flower or start to show here's june july

964
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:44,960
and

965
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,599
we're at 20

966
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,119
right 20 21 hours of light

967
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,000
up here so

968
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,879
it's

969
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,639
we just kind of get ripped off

970
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,039
i'd love to grow some outdoors that just

971
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,280
did auto trigger and

972
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,119
a regular photo

973
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,960
photo

974
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,960
cannabis without doing light depth

975
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,078
are you having trouble in your grill

976
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,400
maybe your plants aren't looking as good

977
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,000
as you know they could be any

978
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,760
experienced grower will tell you that

979
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,480
the number one thing that's going to get

980
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,720
your plants growing to peak performance

981
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,280
is keeping a stable environment and

982
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,959
staying within vpd range

983
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,560
and if you're anything like me you can't

984
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,720
afford a two to three hundred dollar

985
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,119
environmental sensor well coconuts got

986
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,118
you back

987
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,838
now for the low price of 6942 you can

988
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,399
pick up your very own coconut mitsu

989
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,880
humidity temperature and vpd charting

990
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,800
with real-time push-to-app notifications

991
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,280
will send notifications directly to your

992
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,240
phone keeping you in tune with your grow

993
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,960
24 hours a day you can go to coconut.com

994
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:00,719

1006
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,920
something that we can expect here in the

1007
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:36,959
future no not the strains i had actually

1008

1017
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,358
i mean he's like he's in it for the long

1018
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,078
haul

1019
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,598

1020
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,039
last year now it's about a year and a

1021
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,079
half ago he had just brought that out of

1022
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,599
the freezer

1023
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,440
did a huge grow out did a huge

1024
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359

1025
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,358
stock right back in the freezer you know

1026

in pure form

1029
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,838
and that's that's good [ __ ] that he can

1030
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,920
just break it out if he wanted it yeah

1031
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,639

00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,959
going to be around for very long if

1157
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,560
if i didn't hear it nobody would say

1158
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,000
[ __ ] his son

1159
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,679
owns ziploc seeds and he'd say that my

1160
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
dad invented william's wonder and i

1161
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,960
don't think anybody ever [ __ ] once

1162
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,358
heard it

1163
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,519
you know my my biggest experience with

1164
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,239
it has been the crosses that p did with

1165
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,318
it

1166
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,318
with the williams wonder and he did a

1167
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,039
great work with that

1168
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,880
chick cross is good oh yeah

1169
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,079
it's some of my favorite [ __ ] i've grown

1170
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,640
from him

1171
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,318
i just remade a couple of crosses the

1172
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,519
williams wondered in my uh vintage

1173
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,159
blueberry it was kind of like the

1174
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:32,239
opposite of what you know um he had made

1175
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:34,399
a blue magoo dj shorts blueberry and

1176
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,519
williams wonder i did the opposite male

1177
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,400
to female

1178
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,400
backwards deal but it was the sssc uh

1179
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,439
f3

1180
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,559
i used

1181
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,599
my vintage blueberry so

1182
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,599
it is

1183
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,519
damn good weed it's different it's come

1184
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,200
out different i grew this blue magoon

1185
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,800
it's really killer weed it grew a

1186
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:58,480
certain way and did a certain thing mine

1187
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,318
does something else but it's it's uh one

1188
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,800
of the ones i think should be grown

1189
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:05,440
that's a really nice one

1190
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,760
beautiful and smokes good i promote the

1191
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,760
blue magoo back cross twice a lot and i

1192
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,400
think you would be happy about this but

1193
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,040
chris told me the other day that he's

1194
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,119
about to release the or maybe he already

1195
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,920
has the back cross three

1196
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,760
and he said that bat cross is way

1197
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,680
heavier on the williams wonder side it

1198
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,640
really resembles my brother he's always

1199
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,118
working so he puts in the work and you

1200
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,719
know i know i know for a fact he did get

1201
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,400
some of his blueberry is the same

1202
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:33,919
blueberry i use so when we get into the

1203
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,440
blueberry stuff

1204
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,838
because the best blueberry that he's

1205
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,760
ever found and that's what he claims the

1206
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,078
best sweetest blueberry he's found is

1207
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,280
the uh kenneth goose bay blueberry it

1208
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,560
came from

1209
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,680
a friend of mine up here his name is uh

1210
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,519
greedy

1211
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,519
oh ak legends

1212
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,199
ak legend

1213
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,880
yeah he had the

1214
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,318
you know about 20 years of that connect

1215
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,318
games bay blueberry it's right where he

1216
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,599
lived is his house right there connect

1217
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,800
news bay

1218
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,760
and um

1219
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,400
it became pretty good uh brand name [ __ ]

1220
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,400
even though it was black market days

1221
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,960
it was a sought after brand name

1222
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,800
people went for kgb

1223
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,119
bgb has always been a thing you know

1224
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,960
killer green but that [ __ ] kgb is a

1225
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,838
[ __ ] term that's been locked in up

1226
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,519
here

1227
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,039
for a long time

1228
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,159
some people call it gooseberry but

1229
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,119
there's i've heard that there's a

1230
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,199
canadian gooseberry uh blueberry q so

1231
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,280
it's very confusing it was probably a

1232
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,759
local blueberry in canada

1233
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,000
it has got a lot of blueberries yeah yes

1234
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,319
they do in the east coast

1235
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,880
i've heard the goose bay i've heard just

1236
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:40,400
regular canadian blueberry

1237
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,318
i know blueberries over there like the

1238
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,358
mother of berries was basically down

1239
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,199
from like a good blueberry

1240
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,480
oh there's so many good berries like

1241
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,598
that

1242
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,599
i did cross the mother of berries tomato

1243
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,039
sorry i made a shitload of that mother

1244
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,039
of berries and uh 907 blue jeans and 907

1245
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,960
blue jeans is the connect gooseberry

1246
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,559
blueberry to my vintage blueberry it's

1247
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,440
probably

1248
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:08,239
my best great uh go-to sweet blueberry

1249
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,079
that 907 blue jeans you can just get a

1250
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,519
handful of girls out of that every time

1251
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,119
that are going to be

1252
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,639
you might have to go through five of

1253
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,880
them and flip a coin and have a couple

1254
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,559
people smoke out on them to get a one

1255
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,800
because i revenge four or five every

1256
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,799
time i think like oh well those that's

1257
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
one for sure but these four are right

1258
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,160
there with it so [ __ ] it we'll rerun it

1259
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,519
and see what happens

1260
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,759
that mother of berries is real

1261
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,719
interesting it

1262
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,200
grows full of big old nice fruity big

1263
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,399
donks and it has green leaf and in the

1264
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,118
calyxes

1265
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,318
in about six weeks they start turning

1266
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,640
purple inside so the bud turns colors

1267
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,679
this is on the vintage

1268
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,118
no mother of berries

1269
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,639
just to be straight that's a you know

1270
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,519
it's weird how certain plants have some

1271
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,679
purple some will have purple

1272
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:58,960
and they turn purple like um

1273
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,759
anna um or say gooey breeder of the the

1274
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,159
guy

1275
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,400
can exotics i mean uh he

1276
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,039
he'll have purple cord buds that just

1277
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,400
are naturally purple that start up at

1278
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,480
two to three weeks in and these

1279
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,920
[ __ ] turn purple from the coron

1280
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,760
up and then

1281
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,119
other ones have purple

1282
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,319
in different ways and they'll have

1283
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:21,599
purple uh patio purple uh vein down the

1284
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:23,119
middle of the leaf vein and then

1285
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,519
have um

1286
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,680
start to purple up that way later on and

1287
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,119
somehow purple leaf and then you know

1288
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,719
green inside the hole but it'll be a

1289
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,480
purple exterior from maybe

1290
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:37,358
photosynthesis or cooling and those

1291
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,960
purples express one way

1292
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,318
it's so weird how the purple there's

1293
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,318
probably four or five different

1294
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,318
expressions in purples some have a

1295
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,838
purple underskirt some won't have any

1296
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,759
some will be a purple top and green

1297
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,838
bottom some will have [ __ ] purple top

1298
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,839
and purple bottom

1299
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,318
so many variations

1300
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,960
that's the best thing about the cannabis

1301
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,880
i get i get crazy about

1302
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,960
combinations and wanting to bring out

1303
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,800
the expression so my mind's like going

1304
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,920
i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this

1305
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,160
and

1306
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,519
oh man i can target some [ __ ] but um

1307
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,000
[Music]

1308
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,039
it's uh there's so much more can be done

1309
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,039
oh yeah

1310
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,639
yeah i think one of the best

1311
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,279
ways that i've ever heard is when it

1312
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,960
comes to breeding it's it's an art

1313
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,200
and you're the painter and you're going

1314
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,358
to create it you know within your vision

1315
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,358
of what you want i got a good handle on

1316
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,679
breeding because

1317
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,000
my whole life i didn't spread animals

thing i learned was breeding rabbits

1326
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,079

coming out and uh

1427
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,639
it was like poly hybrids of poly hybrids

1428
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:31,039
of poly hybrids like the current [ __ ]

1429
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,039
scene that is today in cannabis and we

1430
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,960
try to get some normality of it i

1431
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,838
started doing a massive amount of

1432
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
testing for hips and uh

1433
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:40,719
yeah

1434
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,240
we got a lot of long weight we went with

1435
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,639
10 hip which is university of

1436
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,719
pennsylvania and the ofa orthopedic

1437
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,440
foundation of animals

1438
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,558
my vet the hillside wellness center here

1439
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,200
she

1440
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,079
took my money for a lot of times 200 to

1441
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,679
300 tests i think i've done 60 70 tests

1442
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,720
and i'd get to be involved with it

1443
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,879
because i'd be the one that would

1444
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,719
describe the extract you put the dog and

1445
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,400
esta size them

1446
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,719
put them on a ventilator

1447
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,559
uh you got to extract the panhip is

1448
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,078
actually a pop that you displace their

1449
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,680
[ __ ] hips and you do this with

1450
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,200
hundreds of pounds of force you spread

1451
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,279
them on the table pop their hips out a

1452
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:16,960
[ __ ] joint measure it then you

1453
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,240
another one where you press them in you

1454
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,838
put their hips together put your knees

1455
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,959
together and press in

1456
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,639
and then there's another one where you

1457
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,880
stretch them out lengthwise and that's

1458
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,239
an ofa view so

1459
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,160
through all these combinations of

1460
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,078
[ __ ] views and calculations and four

1461
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,879
or five different bets determined that

1462
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,839
the dog's got a rating so i it's pen hip

1463
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,680
rating

1464
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,920
and ofa does rating two there's all the

1465
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,719
excellent [ __ ] there's only like one or

1466
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,318
two american bulldogs ever made the ofa

1467
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,399
excellent rating so

1468
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,039
anyway i was i got them up good enough

1469
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,800
to where i produced ofa excellent dogs

1470
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,358
and there wasn't many of them i produced

1471
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,240
one i got the ofa rating

1472
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,799
from like 80 percentile which was loose

1473
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,399
as [ __ ] 80 and 90th percentile loose as

1474
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,599
[ __ ] dogs gonna be crippled from

1475
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,838
dysplasia

1476
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,318
so we got it down to the 10th percentile

1477
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:06,239
and we were [ __ ] jamming on that

1478
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,800

don't want to do straight father a lot

1487
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,199
of the

1488
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,680
table terrier guys that have winning

1489
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,239
champion dogs they are they do father to

daughter and do a ton of in breeding and

1491
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,078
ton of it and they lock that [ __ ] down

1492
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,839
but you're gonna lock down any of your

1493
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,680
issues so if you had a perfect dog you

1494
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,679
could do that but you're gonna [ __ ]

1495
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:42,799
do that with the dog that has issues you

1496
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,558
want to

1497
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,800
keep us somewhat fresh but anyway i get

1498

a coefficiency on my dogs

1499
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,200
where i like them

1501
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,318
you know big confirmation shows or um

1502
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,079

1503
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:00,159
protection tournament testing and

1504
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,599
training and uh certification and all

1505

1543
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,119

1549
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,240
to turn and look at that bar on the back

1550
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,440
of my deal and then i'd run back to the

1551
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:33,439
ranch put that thing in the meat cooler

1552
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,358
run over to the i never once slept i

1553
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,798

1554
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:38,480
the show with the bulldogs that caught

1555
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,440
the damn pigs

1556
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,039
so

1557
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,480
we've made our mark in the whole thing

1558
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,079
they've called me that [ __ ] from

1559
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,280
alaska because i'm

1560
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,359
not like

1561
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,760
in an [ __ ] i'm just louder and more

1562
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:51,358
i'm on coffee and i'm like

1563
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,280
unfiltered

1564
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,358
unfiltered you know

1565
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,960
so we we hold we put our mark and i go

1566
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:58,558
down to texas and they

1567
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,000
might about get your ass phone kicked in

1568
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,440
texas bunch of guys down there a little

1569
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,559
bit tougher they ain't take it like

1570
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,159
california guys so i'd get mouthy down

1571
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,079
there and i'd have four or five guys in

1572
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,358
the talking together in a group and i'm

1573
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,599
not thinking i'm gonna have to get into

1574
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:13,358
a fight with [ __ ] but i'd hold my own

1575
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,640
i'd steal a couple of their confirmation

1576
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,358
points where they couldn't champion

1577
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,480
their dog out and go back to alaska i

1578
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:20,400
did that saying

1579
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,400
multiple times so i did grand champion

1580
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,160
dogs out there i met dogs that were good

1581
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,400
i improved them enough to where i made

1582
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:30,000
dual grand champion dogs i won seven

1583
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,000
best in shows with one female

1584
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,279
you're beating the other strain of dogs

1585
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,280
the bully dogs that's your class

1586
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,440
you're beating the next class you then

1587
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,280
you meet beat the best male in that

1588
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,559
class then you beat the best male in

1589
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,798
that show

1590
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,760

1592
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,720
you're you've gone somewhere with the

1593
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:55,358
dogs this is like

1594
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:58,239
a lot of work though but that gave me a

1595
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,558
straight up idea how to give me a lot of

1596

1598
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:07,039
[ __ ] pig breeding i go to straight

1599
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,200
semen farms just get pigs do all my own

1600
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:12,880
ais so alaska alaska's big stock sucked

1601

1602
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,039

1608
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,440

make sure you guys can come right down

1611
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,199
the rabbit hole of looking for this guy

1612
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,039

1616
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,119
because that's a near-extinctive strain

1617
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,719
of chicken um my main interest in

1618
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,318
breeding cannabis a lot of it is a

1619
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,399
one-time thing i happen to get my hands

1620
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,558
on somebody collected it and [ __ ]

1621
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,559
whatever some of it is very rare like

1622
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,798
the guy's collecting [ __ ] in the fall in

1623
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,400
77. i get my hands on it i'm gonna

1624
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,679
[ __ ] preserve it if it don't come out

1625
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,440
pure to itself i'm gonna cross it to

1626
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,440
something they would express good with

1627
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,159
it or whatever but that's how i am if i

1628
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,000
hear

1629
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:11,039
shetland chicken is almost extinct in

1630
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,039
the world it's a blue egg layer which

1631
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,838
genetics originally comes from south

1632
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,440
america by way of spaniard conquistadors

1633
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:19,440
going up into

1634
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,599
northern europe this this genetics

1635
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,358
finally ends up because the only blue

1636
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,599
acres in the world is the shetland

1637
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:28,159

00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,519
or opal leg bars this morning that's the

1653
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,358
one of the i mean they just came into

1654
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,119
america in like 11 a lot of these

1655
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,199
chicken strains have never come to

1656
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,798
america they had been banned from

1657
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,798
importation and a lot of them are

1658
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:14,719
[ __ ] dutch german english and

1659
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,480
green fire farms is one that brought in

1660
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:19,118
most of these really killer lines the

1661
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,039
french marines and

1662
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,318
the leg bars now they're getting

1663
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,119
distributed everywhere it's kind of like

1664
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:28,000
the elite cannabis

1665
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:31,119

1666
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,400
the word out and uh it spreads out each

1667
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,960
person that

1668
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,480
gets it it's not on lockdown they do

1669

whatever they want with it so some

1670
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,318
people would

1671
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,920
bootleg it at quarter of the price or

1672
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,599

wonderful

1698
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,920
he made a couple of cool crosses like

1699
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:38,798
the uh

1700
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,559
that

1701
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,440

gooseberry blueberry to his um cheese bx

1703

so that [ __ ]

1704
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,680
looking through it right now maybe it'll

1705
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,599
put off that blueberry cheesecake oh

1706
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,598
because this cheese is really good [ __ ]

1707
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,760
i know that he worked hard to get on and

1708
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,838
working on

1709
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,920
that blueberry is a gift blueberry is a

1710
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,239
gift you [ __ ] get that [ __ ] it's

1711
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,760
sweet good ass blueberry that [ __ ]

1712
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:04,719
tiny gooseberry blueberry you're not

1713
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,920
gonna

1714
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,239
you're not the [ __ ] around you can

1715
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,720
target it

1716
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,838
it definitely added to the grapefruit in

1717
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:13,358
a good way

1718
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:16,078
i'm curious because that like the

1719
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,679
grapefruit web of his was a super killer

1720
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,400
grapefruity uh

1721
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:22,639
deal and uh when i crossed it

1722
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,160
to grapefruit

1723
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,838
badass from ice river genetics

1724
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,639
they um

1725
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,838
it's a [ __ ] killer plant still

1726
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,798
not as 45 day fast for 50 days fast as

1727
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:37,759
the

1728
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:40,159
pure grape fruit web but it had [ __ ]

1729
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,640
double that grapefruit flavor so

1730
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:45,199
this one still retain the grapefruit but

1731
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,639
that blueberry added so much bag appeal

1732
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,639
and color to it

1733
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,558
what's happening juice i'd like to think

1734
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,838
it add a juice flavor to it yeah well

1735
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,440
and that's the other thing is that

1736
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:54,719
blueberry didn't get rid of the

1737
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,639
grapefruit

1738
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,639
but it did accent it like it's

1739
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,159
definitely got a heavy blueberry there

1740
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,318
but it's playing along with the

1741
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:03,519
grapefruit really nice got to be more

1742
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,920
grapefruit like what i was saying

1743
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,920
earlier i'm gonna be uh this afternoon

1744
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,079
i'm gonna go grab a [ __ ]

1745
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,079
20 year old cut of uh

1746
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,720
pure island sweet skunk

1747
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,880
oh yeah you're talking about that

1748
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:19,199
the grapefruit web uh

1749
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,480
grapefruit badass crosses that i got all

1750
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,798
uh

1751
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,880
or the oh you know bx a little bit on

1752
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:26,079
the older i had that island sweet skunk

1753
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,760
one time

1754
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,599
it was a

1755
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,200
hard to manage plant

1756
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,440
it grows six inches a day i actually

1757
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,598
grew in the greenhouse for at first when

1758
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,480
hit the eight foot mark i realized i was

1759
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,318
[ __ ] so um i flowered the damn thing

1760
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,318
to nl1 trying to

1761
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,318
control these genetics on that runaway

1762
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:46,960
ditch and uh they don't want to

1763
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:49,759
generally squat everything or put 50 or

1764
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,920
more in that category it'll like it'll

1765
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,920
show its influence really strong it's a

1766
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,480
fairly well inbred afghani so the island

1767
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:02,400
sweet skunk it over ran the

1768
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,719
nl1 so wow started by 25 seeds two or

1769
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,318
three days ago of that island sweets

1770
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,318
volcano one

1771
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,480
it's been a while since i've encountered

1772
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,558
it wasn't that island sweet skunk pretty

1773
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,480
[ __ ] short plant to begin with but it

1774
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,160
branched out pretty bushy

1775
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,358
i don't know about that this is old

1776
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:21,519
original um genetics here and it's

1777
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:22,719
yeah beyond my time it's

1778
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,119
it's uh

1779
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,959
it's known he's saying it's the probably

1780
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,480
the wildest thing he [ __ ] houses

1781
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,358
other things that were like that for me

1782
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,480
were really good was uh

1783
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:37,519
like oh seven i got a hold of uh space

1784
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,760
jill that um i grew also chocolate the

1785
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:41,920
original d line that was it was labeled

1786
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,400
on that line i had [ __ ] space jill

1787
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,480
and d-line and i'm indoors growing this

1788
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,920
[ __ ] and i read the right outside that's

1789
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,440
one of the few times in the world i'd

1790
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,680
get on those

1791
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,519
forums you know i i've researched this

1792
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,838
and i go man i gotta have that then i'd

1793
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:58,480
go grab it and they were warning that if

1794
01:03:55,838 --> 01:04:00,078
you don't the chocolate it was like they

1795
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,000
said four foot

1796
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,318
minimum height and don't grow it under

1797
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,480
lights or you get over running [ __ ] so i

1798
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,239
started at 18 inches it's gonna be great

1799
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,199
well it's solid went to four [ __ ]

1800
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:14,000
foot it is a serious big long cola

1801
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:17,358
biomass not out of control but man it is

1802
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,039
what they said 100 but the space joe did

1803
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,119
grow six inches a day if you had it

1804
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,079
tuned in and it was feeding and had root

1805
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,160
zone

1806
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,400
you could dwarf it for sure and kind of

1807
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,239
keep it a little bit slow but that's

1808
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,240
what i call a biomass producer it's

1809
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,679
almost an out of control [ __ ] indoor

1810
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,199
plant you

1811
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:35,038
you have a heart and she's funny she's

1812
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,399
trying to reproduce right now or go back

1813
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,119
to any

1814
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,079

1815
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:44,000
can to vic high's uh gift that that uh

1816

1817
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,440
through her um

1818
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,280
was um

1819

to wholesale for them and i've bought

1821
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,519

1825
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,519
you know at wholesale and i could just

1826
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,119
run through it

1827
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,519
she's trying to reproduce her original

1828
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,880
space queen or space jail right now the

1829
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:08,798
space bomb that's what she's going

1830
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,680
through taxes baseball which was at the

1831
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:11,599
last

1832
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:12,960
jail production so if anybody has

1833
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,559
original

1834
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,119
ace jail

1835
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,720
hacks or original old old old [ __ ]

1836
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,318
space queen

1837
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:24,078
you know kick that [ __ ] to her

1838
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,279
that that'd be uh

1839
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:29,519
probably helped her out a lot

1840
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,039
man that's good we the original space

1841
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,639
channel was [ __ ] damn good

1842
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,160
you're looking for space shield not

1843
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,000
space queen or is it the same thing

1844
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,399
either one well most you know the space

1845
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,079
dude the male version of space queen

1846
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,079
that's what [ __ ] like all of his

1847
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,400
breeders produced everything came out of

1848
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,400
that one [ __ ] deal the original

1849
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,680
space drill seeds i got was like the

1850
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,680
[ __ ] f1 right off f1 ish or whatever

1851
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,279
this [ __ ] was fire it was like different

1852
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:56,480
you know weed changes and everybody

1853
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,920
breeds it you're gonna get a slightly

1854
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,920
different expression two or three

1855
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,400
environments later it's not the [ __ ]

1856
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,920
same and they never kept a clone ever

1857
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,358
all they would do is grow from seed

1858
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,440
every single generation because they

1859
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:08,400
didn't have room to keep the claims

1860
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,079
so

1861
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,000
it definitely had no i'm not going to

1862
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,760
see generational shift but it's [ __ ]

1863
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,079
changed so

1864
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,680
original space jail was a [ __ ] good

1865
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,640
product that's some of the things i

1866
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:21,199

01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,038
young say uh

1900
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:32,318
10 years old because

1901
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,240
there was no there was a guy around

1902
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,558
back then people were just so different

1903
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:38,719
and killed it was like

1904
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,000
people on the radio with like the eagles

1905

01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,079
people were like chill it was so much

1907
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,759

1908
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,440
getting a bunch of ounces we didn't call

1909
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,160
it ounces of weed they call it lids he's

1910
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,000
buying lids so we'd have a meat dc to

1911
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,480
de-stem it and roll joints for him and i

1912
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,480
was like at like 10 years older very

1913
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,960
nimble fingers very [ __ ] good at it

1914
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,159
he would give funny he was using those

1915
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,679
the old zigzag wheat papers which were

1916
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,798
yellow he would he would tell everybody

1917
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,960
that

1918
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,079
nobody nothing causes cancer except the

1919
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,400
paper and

1920
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,880
the thing and he would say that wheat

1921
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,680
papers didn't cause cancer this [ __ ]

1922
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,159
guy

1923
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:19,599
so anyway it's five dollars a lid and

1924
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,519
ten dollars a lit for you know uh import

1925
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,400
weed which was generally brick some of

1926
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,640
it wasn't super compressed some somewhat

1927
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,158
but they um i would roll the [ __ ] out

1928
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,880
and where was it coming from at that

1929
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:33,838
time for you i think

1930
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,880
at this point that was in oregon so

1931
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:36,399
okay

1932
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,159
i don't know where the [ __ ] it would

1933
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,000
have been coming from when i was in

1934
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,838
washington a little bit i could direct i

1935
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,279
knew where it was coming from there was

1936
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:44,798
a lot of mexican imports straight

1937
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,480
through the columbia river when i was in

1938
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:48,880
oregon i don't know where that important

1939
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:50,718
came from i was right at

1940
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,798
when i started getting into it i was

1941
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:55,119
right at that time where most of it was

1942
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,679
mexican but we had just started getting

1943
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:59,358
some like good green but some kind yeah

1944
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,359
it was different well we never saw that

1945
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,838
back then this was the pure original

1946
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,319
[ __ ] paraquadish type of old [ __ ]

01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,960
poor [ __ ] weed

1961
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,400
i don't even know that it really got us

1962
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,640
hot you get about as high as [ __ ]

1963
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,798
tobacco because i got super i got spun

1964
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,798
out from tobacco at that point hard so

1965
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:47,039
i'd say it was equal to some tobacco

1966
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,640
height and i didn't enjoy it i've got to

1967
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:49,759
ask you a question

1968
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,520
back then

1969
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,198
way beyond my time

1970
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,880
were you smoking the seeds in your

1971
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:56,559
joints

1972
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,319

1973
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,159
that guy was having me rolled this

1974
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,880
because he didn't want to deal with the

1975
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:05,359
[ __ ] amount of work it was to [ __ ]

1976
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,279
deseed a lid of that weed you know right

1977
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:08,799
no seeds were seeds or give you a

1978
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:09,599
straight up [ __ ] headache and they'd

1979
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,840

1982
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:18,079
one or two times desperation as a child

1983
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,479
thinking after i already knew what we

1984
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,479

1985
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:24,559
get high off the seeds and try to smoke

1986
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,479
it that's how you know at 10 11 it's

1987
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,520

1990
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,719

1998
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,280
back then bikers were pretty hardcore

1999
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,520
people but they had some weed

2000
01:10:55,279 --> 01:11:00,158
i can call a tie bud and it was on a

2001
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:02,560
[ __ ] stick it was like on a actual

2002
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,879
literal bamboo stick laced with like a

2003
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,880
[ __ ] string from the whole

2004
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,480
length of the

2005
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,400
main stem the

2006
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,559
the um apical

2007
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,960
stem there's like ham stirring basically

2008
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,640
and that's what that [ __ ] was all bound

2009
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,158
up with so

2010

wheat they knew i was smoking my mom was

2012
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,880
pretty liberal because she

2013
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,399
that's how i ended up it was her friend

2014

that i was rolling all the joints from

2015

2026
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,760
about three hits and it hits me is but

2027
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
one the first thing hit me is the taste

2028
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,159
it was original real chocolate thai it

2029
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,238

2030
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:00,559
licorice um

2031
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,718
chocolate leather

2032
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:06,080
it was [ __ ] a delicious just almost

2033
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:08,319
like an incense type of a flavor um

2034
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:10,559
and then that weed hit me i don't

2035
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:12,158
remember two to three hours [ __ ] of

2036
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,360
the whole [ __ ] event i should have

2037
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,519
never been

2038
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:18,399
um taking care of [ __ ] these people

2039
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,760
are crazy if they let some [ __ ]

2040
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,479
oh

2041
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,480
watch my kids

2042
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,679
i lost three hours aliens could have

2043
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,399
[ __ ] grabbed me that out that three

2044
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,239
hours i don't know

2045
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,599
but i [ __ ] never then i got high you

2046
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:39,439
know from then on that trigger it

2047
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,239
triggered in me that weed made me high

2048
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,839
after that so i knew what levels of of

2049
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,439
the strength was

2050
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,000
but it's weird some of the times at

2051
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:49,119
first if you smoke it really does not

2052
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,880
affect you

2053
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,319
though the first time i smoked i didn't

2054
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,760
get high at all

2055
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,079
but a long time ago it was said [ __ ]

2056
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,600
weed i think if a [ __ ]

2057
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,920
sixth grader gets a hold of the back

2058
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,440
right now i think they got high

2059
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,840
right

2060
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,119
i think

2061
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,920
[ __ ] one hit of that [ __ ] [ __ ]

2062
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:03,920
school they

2063
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,040
went to the shed and they found him

2064
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,039
sleeping in the shed if i can you know

2065
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,479
that's that's the difference in what

2066
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:14,158
we've had

2067
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,319
that little bastard just looks in the

2068
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:19,119
eye and says i didn't feel nothing man

2069
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,119
oh funny

2070
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:23,519
no i the the whole reason i asked behind

2071
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,359
that is because uh one day we were

2072
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,880
talking about i don't know

2073
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,799
i don't even remember who was involved

2074
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,719
but my old man was around

2075
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,159
and i said i remember

2076
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,079
some of that first stuff that we were

2077
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,039

2078
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:37,198
marsh

2079
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:39,119
and uh we'd put it on a paper plate

2080
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,639
grind it up you know and

2081
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,079
just kind of tap the back of the plate

2082
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,199
and let the seeds fall out from the

2083
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,439
weight

2084
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:47,439

2132
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,600

and just like super comical but one my i

2134
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,400

2135
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:35,279
or a [ __ ] result was pop dog

2136
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:37,119
oh damn this is funny but i had never

2137
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:39,039
smoked that sour diesel before that

2138
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,960
[ __ ] 17 right then and there we've

2139
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:42,719
got to smoke his so

2140
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,800
i didn't know [ __ ] about diesels before

2141
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,880
that that's awesome

2142
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,840
i smoked a few different diesels i've

2143
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:53,359
tried a bunch of taco and ajs and

2144
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,719
albany uh

2145
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:55,599
what the [ __ ] might have been another

2146
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,840
one

2147
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,360
but i had never been a big diesel fan

2148
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,079
before but it's pretty good if you have

2149
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,359
a

2150
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:05,519
have that as like 1 or 10 or 15 in a jar

2151
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,839
say you're going out fishing and then

2152
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,360
you smoke like five or one type and then

2153
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,960
you just want to go off a whole

2154
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:12,960
different scale you break out a diesel

2155
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,960
joint it's a whole different thing

2156
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,760
diesels are by far one of my favorite

2157
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,760
types i just the way that they affect me

2158
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,520
um but it's kind of a trade-off because

2159
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,159
a lot of diesels can grow like

2160
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:26,719
[ __ ] too so so

2161
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:28,639

2162
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,960

01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,600

01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,198

2167
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,279

bunch of [ __ ] when we first met i i grew

2175
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,119
up the best thing i grew i think they

2176
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,679
liked a lot the most was the

2177
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:05,760
the milkenberry cookies the original the

2178

01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,800
packs you would get that out of the f1

2183

for sure you'd get a good one

2184
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,560
if you found it it was a good one and it

2185
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,399
changed a lot after that a lot of people

2186
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,600
did different selections that's so weird

2187
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:26,000
how

2188

one pack can put off nine of one

2189
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,279

2230
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,679
that [ __ ] and they look like oh what

2231
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,760
what is that that's not like everybody

2232
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,679
else it's not the [ __ ]

2233
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,199

2234
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:07,679
marvel great cookies it has that just

2235
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,879
that really unique certain taste i'm

2236
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,079
sure there's slightly different

2237
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,159
variances because he we used to

2238
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,399
two or three years later got a v3 pack

2239
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:18,319
of the same thing and then he told me it

2240
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:20,479
was

2241
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,519
like way slower veg

2242
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:25,119
way faster but way more huckleberry and

2243
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,480
he was right the slowest fed in the

2244
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:28,800
[ __ ] world we got a bunch of like

2245
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,238
trifoliate type of growth out of it so

2246
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,320
it was like

2247
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,158
a

2248
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:36,639
super squat

2249
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,799
biomass pig if you didn't like take off

2250
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,400
leafs and take off leaves and we ran

2251
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,760
that thing two or three runs and they

2252
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:44,639
were all the same

2253
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,440
super slow super fast

2254
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,960
um

2255
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:49,039
flour and

2256
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,560
it wasn't nothing like the original that

2257
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:54,158
we keep it's so good though that thing

2258
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,520
there the people up here that are

2259
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:58,960
friends of his the

2260
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,679
east uh frog botanical gardens

2261
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,439
i think they consistently run a super

2262
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,279
killer cut of that

2263
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,638
that uh platinum wickleberry cookies of

2264
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:08,079
his also

2265
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,760
if they have a wreck market down in

2266
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:12,000
homer it's a little

2267
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,800
down 240 miles south of here at the end

2268
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,359
of the

2269
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,239
kenai peninsula

2270
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:20,559
and a real small community and that's

2271
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,319
one of the places they grow and uh

2272
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,400
have dispensaries so they got the market

2273
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,679
handle growing christmas [ __ ] that's

2274
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:30,000
almost all exclusively what they grow

2275
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,600
really really cool that they do that and

2276
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,079
then

2277
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,840
this homer has a lot of [ __ ] dynasty

2278
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,279
here i can [ __ ] honestly say that you

2287
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,039
like

2288
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,719
it's the end of the [ __ ]

2289
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:58,319
peninsula there you drive right out to

2290
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:01,119

2291
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,880

their uh operation i know [ __ ] sure

2294
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,719
the husband of the couple that runs it

2295
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,520
he's a boating fool like us

2296
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,639
the

2297
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,400
hunting fishing ocean killing tools

2298
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,279
oh yeah

2299
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,439
so

2300
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,920
a lot of my patrons have been asking

2301
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:26,319
about your skunk cabbage do you have any

2302
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,319
new plans to do anything with that

2303
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:32,400
yes and no i've done it for a long time

2304
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:35,279
i think i made that straight up in 08 so

2305
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,279
it's what is now like [ __ ] what is

2306
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:39,359
that 12 years or 14 years or something

2307
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:41,519
[ __ ] i've had it a long [ __ ] time but

2308
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,359
i i did just break out some recent

2309
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,520
frozen uh

2310
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:47,679
frozen seeds that actually didn't have

2311
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:50,480
skunk cabbage written on it it still

2312
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,480
said uh

2313
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,560
[ __ ] crazy train

2314
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,359
and d-line so

2315
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,120
they're one of the first generations

2316
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,719
i don't know what it is that's something

2317
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,880
i don't even know what the [ __ ] it was

2318
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:06,639
but they're prior to five i know that i

2319
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:08,400
started calling it skunk cabbage at five

2320
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,159
and um

2321
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:12,238
i used to call it a1 but i already had

2322
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,198
too many a1s you know when i'm doing 50

2323
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,359
or so

2324
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,198
beats i'll go a through z and then one

2325
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:18,719
through whatever and then when i find

2326
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,158
the phenosearch i have all that [ __ ]

2327
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,639
written down

2328
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:24,479
uh classify them as what's best one

2329
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,319
through five and [ __ ] funnier than

2330
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:28,399
[ __ ] but two or three times the number

2331
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:30,238
a1 ends up popping up as being the best

2332
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,039
keeper final so

2333
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,879
you can't keep calling [ __ ] a1 and [ __ ]

2334
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:37,119
there's other a1s in the world the body

2335
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,359
has maybe a haze

2336
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:41,519
you know but bodhi i think has a haze

2337
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:43,759
called a1 or something so people confuse

2338
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,000
mine and they go what where'd this and

2339
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,079
that that no no my a1 is [ __ ] this

2340
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,399
it's just a it was a number

2341
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,800
but number six runs in my [ __ ] lines

2342
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:54,960
too i've got four different things that

2343
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,239
ended up being number six you know my

2344
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,359
americana

2345
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:59,599
the um

2346
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:02,399
[ __ ] ice afghani

2347
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,480
the gst which was um

2348
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:07,198
originally i call it jackson skip

2349
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:09,279
originally strain i got from a

2350
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,439
83 year old dude here he's still alive

2351
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:14,399
he's in bad health right now he got

2352
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:16,319
into a car accident and uh spent a year

2353
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:17,198
in the hospital with a broken back and

2354
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:18,799
then

2355
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,719
now he's wheelchair-bound but he's still

2356
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,760
growing the [ __ ] gst the guy that

2357
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,719
originally

2358
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:28,560
produces with his old crew

2359
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:30,560
pretty uh pretty tough old cat but he's

2360
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,280
he's going downhill i'd like to think he

2361
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,039
doesn't [ __ ] uh

2362
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:37,759
if he can pull out of the [ __ ] his goals

2363
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:40,319
to get out of that wheelchair

2364
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,320
hell yeah

2365
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,279
uh he's a good he's a good old cat him

2366
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,520
and his guys just like us would have

2367
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:49,599
been with uh your little local crew they

2368
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,520
had a local strain and they [ __ ] went

2369
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,920
through it and they would decide

2370
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,679
what was what and they they picked that

2371
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,440
thing after breeding for years and they

2372
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,800
all stuck with the number six that's

2373
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:00,879

everything

2392
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:39,840
those 83 year olds if you're still doing

2393
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,600
it and got a clear mind and [ __ ] they

2395
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,600
right

2396
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:48,238
went through some hard [ __ ]

2397
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:50,880
and some and some good [ __ ]

2398
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:53,678
one of our patreon shitty flips he

2399
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:58,760
wanted to know how is your big skunk

2400
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,760
and is rks still on the planning list

2401
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:04,879
big skunk i haven't um

2402
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:07,359
do tons of [ __ ] with big skunk i have it

2403
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,920
preserved in a couple of forms and it's

2404
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:12,880
available pretty much pure big skunk

2405
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:15,359
just like it was um

2406
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,199
it was a commercial type of strain you

2407
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:18,559
know some of them older [ __ ] was made

2408
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:21,599
for uh

2409
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,520
original commercial it's not going to be

2410
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,800
super strong and you can find killer

2411
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,480
ones in it

2412
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,719
some of that stock that was older

2413
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:31,039
freezer stock uh

2414
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,920
or five years ago sent that [ __ ] to uh

2415
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,760
jackson to mean jean and he reproduced a

2416
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,960
bunch of it outdoors

2417
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,480
and he the way he's so meticulous he

2418
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,840
listed

2419
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:42,559
you know when he breeds he'd grab all

2420
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,159
the

2421
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,159
ones he liked

2422
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:47,439
male wise put them on whatever females

2423
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:49,759
which were going to be whatever but he

2424
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:50,960
listed what their preferences were for

2425
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,199
uh

2426
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,399
exhibition of [ __ ] and uh one or two

2427
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:58,719
were like he said pm was everywhere [ __ ]

2428
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,158
just stick some plants other strains and

2429
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,319
and even these

2430
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:04,559
bad pm but one or two

2431
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:06,799
wouldn't even get pms and then he you

2432
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,480
know noted that [ __ ] for me so i was

2433
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,199
able to breed another generation out in

2434
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:13,039
my greenhouse from the ones that said pm

2435
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:14,638
resistance

2436
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:16,719
and they were man i made a hell of a

2437
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:19,039
difference because big skunk was a pm

2438
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:21,279

weeks early

2447
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,319

americana he's the one that named it

2459
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:06,719
because it was like a joke it was a big

2460
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:09,198
group of 300 of them [ __ ] seeds and

2463
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,238
females told every male we're just

2499
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:47,039
beginning uh how the whole thing went

2500
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,880
down the the benefits that him could do

2501
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,119
the world like he's selling this [ __ ]

2502
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,600
and we knew already we're like we are

2503
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,279
nuts dude we're like

2504
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,360
we are known we're pissed we're like

2505
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:00,319
revolutionists about this [ __ ] back in

2506
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,799
[ __ ] the 80s so we are um

2507
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:06,238
we're all behind them anyway

2508
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,600
this is like 89 in the summer of 89 and

2509
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:09,359
uh

2510
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,920
they get to go visit different gardens

2511
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,679
and [ __ ] play around and anyway i

2512
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,319
give them a half

2513
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:19,199
ounce of the hash which was near bubble

2514
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,960
hash of that that production from the

2515
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:21,119
americana crop

2516
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,560
and

2517
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:24,399
[Music]

2518
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,840
we didn't call it americana back then

2519
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:27,920
but he uh

2520
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,279
he went on his deal a couple days

2521
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,960
meeting other people we met him up about

2522
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,158
the third day and he's like

2523
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,920
i didn't think he'd ever smoked that

2524
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:35,839
[ __ ] it was super expansive and it's

2525
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,279
super [ __ ] strong so i thought it

2526
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,199
would last the whole time and he's going

2527
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:41,279
to smoke other people's weed he comes on

2528
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:42,799
the third day we met up he's completely

2529
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:44,479
out of it asks if he can get any more i

2530
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,480
don't know how he [ __ ] smoked that

2531
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,879
[ __ ] because it's really it was that

2532
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:51,198
strong but his tolerance was

2533
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,800
truly [ __ ] insane because he smoked

2534
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:54,879
all the other [ __ ] best weed that

2535
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,800
people were displaying for him

2536
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,639
and all that i gave him of that [ __ ]

2537
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,360
killer hash and uh

2538
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,359
it was amazing but we got to uh

2539
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:06,399
there's a there's an initiative to

2540
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,000
illegalize marijuana in 1975

2541
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:10,238
what happened was a

2542
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,158
lawyer named raven

2543
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,599
intentionally was arrested with a couple

2544
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,079
joints

2545
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,239
to go to jail and then fight this in

2546
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:21,119
court that he had the right to smoke pot

2547
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:23,359
so this big battle goes out he wins in

2548
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,519
local court goes to the state supreme

2549
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,920
court and wins

2550
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,920
and because of that

2551
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,920
what the deal was they they ruled that

2552
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,719
alaskans have the right to privacy and

2553
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,800
it would override a privacy in their own

2554
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:43,039
home this is

2555
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:44,880
it would override a suspected illegality

2556
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:46,960
the right to have privacy in your home

2557
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,199
would override the fact that a cop

2558
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,960
thinks you're smoking pot indoors so

2559
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:53,839
they write it in the constitution that

2560
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,760
it is legal to

2561
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,159
[ __ ] possess marijuana and they wrote

2562
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,400
it up as 16 plants and four ounces in

2563
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:02,638
your own home you can do this in 1975

2564
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:04,399
that became a law here so

2565
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,800
you couldn't transport it so you still

2566
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,039
get uh

2567
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,880
not no felony [ __ ] for transportation

2568
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,840
but a misdemeanor fine wasn't an

2569
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,440
infraction it was a misdemeanor so uh

2570
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,000
it's still pretty big trouble you could

2571
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:19,919
get like [ __ ] 30 to 90 days or

2572
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,760
something a thousand dollar fine it was

2573
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,079
pretty hairy [ __ ] so

2574
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,880
and bigger the worst and anything over

2575
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:27,840
16 plants and 4 ounces was turning into

2576
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,039
trouble

2577
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,400
so

2578
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:34,000
in 1990 a bunch of really stodgy

2579
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:35,599
people that are starting to move up here

2580
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,198
from the other places

2581
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,360
decide it should be illegal to have

2582
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:40,719
marijuana they don't want the [ __ ] and

2583
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:42,319
they think you know they don't want

2584
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,560
their [ __ ] children there so they get

2585
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:47,039
a initiative going

2586
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,039
alet initiative enough people to sign it

2587
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:52,880
to

2588
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:55,198
outlaw marijuana in alaska so

2589
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,000
yeah we're as patriots you know we all

2590
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:00,079
have tri-cornered hats and we're like at

2591
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,079
the time you look in the 80s late 80s

2592
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:03,600
high times this is going on in ann arbor

2593
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,158
michigan and [ __ ] there's all these

2594
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,760
people that are like protesting

2595
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:09,439
and let's make marijuana legal

2596
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,119
everybody's wearing tri-cornered hats so

2597
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:14,479
that was like our symbol and kind of our

2598
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:16,238
moniker and uh

2599
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:18,238
jack is up here promoting his book

2600
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:21,198
emperor wears no clothes and he decides

2601
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,000
to help with um

2602
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:23,839
you know

2603
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,158
that kind of help with the fight on the

2604
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,840
initiative which was going to be in uh

2605
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,559
the november vote

2606
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,239
to make it illegal to vote but uh i mean

make it illegal to smoke

2608
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,678
but at that point in time

2609
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:37,279
uh

2610
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,039
we were all rallying there was a group

2611
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:40,880
of guys from the states which did more

2612
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:43,439
harm than good because they were all the

2613

yeah it was super it became negative

2634
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:39,039
more than anything so but

2635
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:40,879
during that little rally point we

2636
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:42,880
all of us is a huge group got to go down

2637
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,079
to the denny's there's a there's a

2638
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,000
there's a couple of denny's up here but

2639
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,760
there's one on virgra street it's still

2640
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,479
there today it's like you know regular

2641
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,880
denny's they have a [ __ ] big main

2642
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:55,119
like area and in the back convention

2643
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,800
room and uh

2644
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,639
we got to go

2645
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,480
have our meeting or whatever the [ __ ] it

2646
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:02,560
was in the convention room and somebody

2647
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:05,039
at one point decides to [ __ ] start

2648
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,199
smoking and uh it turned into a

2649
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,439
full-blown [ __ ] smoke fest in the

2650
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,519
denny's restaurant they they served us

2651
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:14,319
not we kept oh no

2652
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:16,320
they kept ordering our stoners so we

2653
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:18,639
ordered every [ __ ] thing on the

2654
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:20,880
[ __ ] menu and

2655
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:23,279
they kept just letting us do it and it's

2656
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:25,440
it was crazy it's like the first known

2657
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:27,759
indoor smoke out that that's probably

2658
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:30,559
ever happened [ __ ] up here for real

2659
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,719
a dangerous story for you to tell no it

2660
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,880
is it's so it's so normal and good no

2661
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:36,319
but at one point though it was leaking

2662
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:39,039
out you know every time they entered

2663
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:40,559
through the conference room doors the

2664
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,560
smoke was just belching out into the

2665
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,000
[ __ ] main area and at one point after

2666
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,679
about three hours

2667
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,760
customers were complaining that the

2668
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,560
[ __ ] smoke was just [ __ ] them up

2669
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,880
and they shut us down on the smoke so

2670
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,320
but it's the it's an epic [ __ ] thing

2671
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,159
that happened right there we were

2672
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:57,198
rallying and it was all like for the

2673
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:59,279
cause

2674
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:01,839
we ended up losing the initiative [ __ ]

2675
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:04,238
in to end the story

2676
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,159
it goes illegal 1990 the [ __ ] [ __ ]

2677
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,399
goes illegal illegal to smoke marijuana

2678
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:10,399
after [ __ ] since 1975 we've always

2679
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:13,359
had the right just to do it to grow your

2680
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:15,439
own and smoke your own so

2681
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:17,920
it's it's like super illegal at this

2682
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,519
point and [ __ ] snitchy ass neighbors

2683
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,600
and people that know what you used to do

2684
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,360
are going to [ __ ] turn you in

2685
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,280
right the eea's up here thick as [ __ ]

2686
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:26,799
this green merchant just went off and

2687
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:29,198
it's still fun going on they're embedded

2688
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,800
like hell so it's scary [ __ ] times in

2689
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:33,039
alaska

2690
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,800
and uh somebody [ __ ]

2691
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:38,238
use

2692
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:40,239
that it is illegal to change the [ __ ]

2693
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:42,238
constitution

2694
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:44,638
with an initiative ballot that goes to

2695
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:46,079
court and [ __ ] they reverse the

2696
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,039
initiative

2697
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:50,960
so

2698
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:53,039
we party we rally [ __ ] alaska is 100

2699
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,439
[ __ ] legal again to smoke and just

2700
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:58,479
shut those [ __ ] whiny you know people

2701
01:35:55,439 --> 01:36:00,238
that were basically

2702
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,638
hockey moms and call them now they were

2703
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:04,079
like soccer moms from scotland

2704
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,079
they came up here and you got to call

2705
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,679
them hockey moms when [ __ ]

2706
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:09,359
but it was the

2707
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,000
that's who made that initiative and just

2708
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:13,920
like evil marijuana evil marijuana [ __ ]

2709
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,238
it's a normal [ __ ] non [ __ ]

2710
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,880
harmful thing besides the

2711
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:20,238
medical aspect is insane

2712
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,960
so

2713
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:26,479
weird though how the evolution of

2714
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,480
of alaska has gone

2715
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:35,119
