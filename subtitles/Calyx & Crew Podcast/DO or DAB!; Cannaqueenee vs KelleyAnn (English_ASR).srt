take a red hot Banger dab Charlie Brown

red [ __ ] hot like glowing

58
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,840
or you can pass take a regular dab but

59
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,340
you don't get the point what a way to

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,580
start the game

61
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,759
right that burns

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,400
what I'm gonna do Queenie we can do it

63
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,560

I know that's for her and it's like the

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,300
first the first challenge of the game

66
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,340

75
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,779
yeah it might burn the fingers a little

76
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,780

00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,359
supercalifragilistic Expialidocious and

105
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,239
