21
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,519
absolutely I appreciate you taking your

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,580
time to come out and uh spend this with

23
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,560
me and get to know you a little bit more

24
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,200
um obviously you've been doing this a

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,700
lot longer than I have so like I said

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,340
you're somebody that I've kind of looked

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,000
up to in that aspect

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,460
um

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,920
let's start from the beginning so I I

30
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,798
can get to know you a little bit more

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,740
when did you first get into cannabis

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,600
what was your first experience

33
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,719
great question

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,839
um I think so so my very first

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,658
experience my mother at the age of 30

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,359
has finally told me that she did have a

37
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,460
joint when she was pregnant with me for

38
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,938
morning sickness so I guess I get to now

39
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,798
be OG and say in utero but I always

40
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,478
remembered the dragonfly guys said that

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,118
and I thought oh that's pretty cool

42
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,859
um anyway so the first time I ever

43
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,359
smoked weed I think I had that pretty

44
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,978
classic experience where you don't

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,538
really get high because you're not

46
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,038
really sure what you're doing and you

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:14,878
know you probably didn't really draw it

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,699
down into your lungs uh but then uh the

49
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,219
next time I did I got a little more high

50
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,378
but to me sort of in that early period

51
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,959
the one that really stands out as super

52
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,179
unique was me and some buddies were um

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
like in this little Forest area near my

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,040
house I was lucky enough to grow up in

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,419
an area called Tweed heads like shout

56
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,639
out to eat bread

57
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,039
um and basically really nice coastal

58
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,738
town in Australia and there was this

59
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,120
little forest and we had like found some

60
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,259
shopping trolleys that were in the

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,700
forest and so like we just tipped them

62
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,859
over on their sides we had like this

63
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:50,639
cool little makeshift couch

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,620
and we got super high and basically I

65
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,479
think it was maybe one of the first or

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,219
within the first few times I'd ever had

67
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,039
like indoor

68
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,598
um weed because in Australia uh outdoor

69
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,098
is quite common and if you're like a

70
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,479
young person you know Beggars can't be

71
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,419
choosers you're probably getting a lot

72
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,539
of bushweed so I had this sort of potent

73
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,639
indoor stuff and I got so high I

74
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,739
remembered looking at my buddy sitting

75
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,658
on the shopping trolley cart with you

76
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,300
know the trees as the backdrop behind

77
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:20,878
him and very distinctly saying to him

78
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,459
like oh man like you've got a green

79
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,719
screen behind you like that the trees in

80
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,158
the back that's not real men that's a

81
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,800
green screen I can see the outline

82
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,419
around you it's fake and I guess in

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,280
retrospect it was sort of the first real

84
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,139
psychedelic experience because I'd

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,900
gotten high but like I was I was truly

86
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,339
like having some visuals and I guess a

87
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,039
reflection of having such a low

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,598
tolerance but that one always lasted

89
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,039
with me I loved it and then one other

90
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,840
one which I'll mention which I haven't

91
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,798
really mentioned before was as I was

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,959
mentioning we're getting a lot of

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,260
bushweed right like in in the Australian

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,860
bushweed is largely speaking heirloom

95
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,840
Thai varieties so they're like these big

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,060
Thai varietals that handle the Heat and

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,219
the humidity really well you get huge

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,620
yields off them Unfortunately they

99
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,359
didn't quite have that tie effect that

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,000
you would hope for like this really nice

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,340
you know connoisseur sativa sort of

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,259
thing so it wasn't quite the high but it

103
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,780
had most of the other characteristics so

104
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,199
one time I get this batch of weed and

105
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,660
it's distinctly minty in smell I'd never

106
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,340
had anything like it very minty and it

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,139
looked like essentially what sort of

108
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,239
Tire sticks look like nowadays and I

109
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,918
hadn't really experienced that so I

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,720
tried this stuff and it was truly

111
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,879
memorable but I never had the words to

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,320
describe why I liked it so much and

113
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,839
looking back it was because it was like

114
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,339
it was uplifting and creative and really

115
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,039
fun and me and all my friends had it at

116
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,478
a party it was a great time so I think

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
when I first got into weed I sort of

118
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,000
didn't think I had these very

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,620
interesting stories and then the more I

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,360
thought about it I'm like no no like I

121
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,459
guess I have had some cool stuff happen

122
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,199
so that would be how I sort of first got

123
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:53,939
into it

124
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,280
awesome man

125
00:04:53,939 --> 00:05:01,019
and I you've come such a far away since

126
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,779
that moment you know you're you're doing

127
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,180
more than I even knew about

128
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,339
um honestly I didn't pay that much

129
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,800
attention to podcasts when I started

130
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,839
doing this maybe a couple years ago I'm

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,780
still pretty fresh at it

132
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,579
um but it's funny when I get people ask

133
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,559
me you know what podcast do you listen

134
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,418
to Doc and it's like I I really don't

135
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,519
listen to podcasts it's kind of a weird

136
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,379
thing but I do this and I don't really

137
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,079
listen to very many but one of the ones

138
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,719
that I am always consistent of is the

139
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,120
podcast and that's because I've always

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,400
appreciated you as an interview or

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
you're very articulate you get very deep

142
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,418
into things that mean a lot to people

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,699
like you and people like me that

144
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:44,639
actually grow this plant Steward this

145
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:48,538
plant and love and have a passion for it

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,819
so we can speak from that perception you

147
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,918
know of like the home grower

148
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,659
um so it's really cool seeing you get in

149
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,698
with some of the biggest names in

150
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,740
cannabis you know especially people that

151
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,220
I would just dream of [ __ ] talking to

152
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,900
and you have this amazing catalog build

153
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,780
up from you doing this over the years

154
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,659
how did we go from your first experience

155
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:12,599
with cannabis into

156
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,759
I'm going to create a podcast and this

157
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,340
is where we're gonna go with it

158
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,900
how did okay I guess the good question

159
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:24,060
would be how did a man from Australia

160
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:28,138
where this is such a hard [ __ ] thing

161
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,740
to you know be public with go from that

162
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,960
to becoming the podcast

163
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,939
uh again man I gotta start off like

164
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,680
thank you I gotta gotta keep my head

165
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,319
from getting too big you're giving me

166
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,819
too many compliments but I really do

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,560
appreciate that you take the time to

168
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,819
listen to the show and I totally

169
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,259
understand what you're talking about

170
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,319
like when you're running a show

171
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,960
sometimes you get like audio fatigue and

172
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,879
it's almost hard to find the the mental

173
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,620
space to listen to other stuff so I

174
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,680
totally get you there's still a few

175
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,120
shows I listen to I um I try to stay in

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,538
touch with all the guys who I'm homies

177
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,459
with so like yourself do gross show

178
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,318
um breed of Syndicate Adam Dunn those

179
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,959
are sort of the the staple ones I check

180
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,259
out for sure but I think your question

181
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,379
is um is good it's I've thought about

182
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,479
that myself uh I I think that there's a

183
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,918
lot of factors at play and it plays into

184
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,180
what you said

185
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:26,698
part of My Success has been the momentum

186
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,220
I got from certain episodes and I really

187
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,919
want to acknowledge that that I was very

188
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,380
lucky to get certain guests and that

189
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,698
gave me a certain amount of momentum

190
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,038
that I think I wouldn't have had

191
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,840
otherwise so definitely want to

192
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,279
acknowledge that and I think the obvious

193
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,138
one would be

194
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,598
um I think the first two episodes really

195
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,680
set me up to be able to approach other

196
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,560
guests

197
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,740
but to get more to the heart of your

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,079
question uh how did I go from yeah being

199
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,960
like sort of this guy in Australia to

200
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,719
doing the podcast I think situationally

201
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,239
there wasn't too many podcasts at the

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,819
time so I I had made the transition from

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,120
like a smoker to a grower and I was

204
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,098
watching the weed nerd I was watching

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,019
um Emerald cup talks there was this one

206
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,060
that used to be up about uh the Rev

207
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,159
talking about just giving Organics a try

208
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,740
and that sort of what got me into

209
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,280
Organics and then I would watch sub cool

210
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,259
and I'd use his super soil recipe so I'd

211
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,959
sort of watch these different

212
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,879
um programs and I was just learning I

213
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,120
wasn't growing particularly great weed

214
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,099
at the time very much still learning

215
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,580
and after a while

216
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,099
I sort of felt like I had watched

217
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,538
all of the content on like YouTube that

218
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,899
I could sort of get my hands on that was

219
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:48,059
interesting and I felt like there was a

220
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,519
really good amount of information for

221
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,739
entry-level Growers but at a certain

222
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:57,299
point I was looking for more advanced

223
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,799
sort of content and I I the names on the

224
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,778
tip of my tongue I really want to give

225
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,299
them a shout out it was a guy from

226
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:05,580
Portland he um

227
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,019
oh I'm gonna at some point in the

228
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,700
episode I'll remember and I'll chime in

229
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,919
and say it but there was one guy I used

230
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,360
to watch uh Maddie Cropper that was his

231
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,979
name Maddie Cropper

232
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,659
um I liked his content I felt like it

233
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,639
was like a little more targeted a little

234
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:18,958
more advanced but basically I just sort

235
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,338
of looked at it and I was like hey it

236
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,139
seems like there's a bit of a vacuum

237
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,899
here there's a lot of great content for

238
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,338
entry-level people but there's not too

239
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,440
much intermediate stuff and there's

240
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,480
nothing Advanced really and I don't know

241
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,180
if I'd put my show in the category of

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,680
advanced I'd say it's probably more

243
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,419
intermediate in the grand scheme of

244
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,239
things but I just thought you know what

245
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:41,338
like no one's doing it so that's really

246
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,860
advantageous right because they can't

247
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,360
compare you to anything so like that's

248
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,100
helpful

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,980
um it sort of it makes makes your thing

250
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,440
better if it's hard to judge it so

251
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,039
um I I thought to myself

252
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,140
right yeah so I thought let's do it and

253
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,179
I started messaging people and like no

254
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,399
one really got back to me and I think

255
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,439
that was because I I can't remember how

256
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,120
I was approaching people but what year

257
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,760
was it

258
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,399
good question 2015 I think wow 2015. so

259
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,200
I should give a little more context in

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,839
the two years prior to that I had

261
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,600
started an Instagram and I was trying to

262
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,880
be active in the Australian community

263
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,200
and I was just giving away seeds and I

264
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,360
was just hoping some people would grow

265
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
them so I was making seeds before I

266
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,759
started the show and part of my

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,440
motivation to start the show was that I

268
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,600
just legitimately had a bunch of

269
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,980
questions I wanted to ask the big

270
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,620
breeders and I knew that I think I tried

271
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,300
typing some out one day and I after I

272
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,339
got to like a Page worth of questions I

273
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,899
was like No One's Gonna like you know if

274
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,060
I got an email like this I'd be like no

275
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,159
way too hard basket

276
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,739
um so I sort of thought a podcast was an

277
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,039
interesting way to circumvent that

278
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,379
excuse me and essentially be able to

279
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,639
like ask a whole bunch of questions to

280
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,259
someone but because it's recorded

281
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,639
everyone gets to benefit from it and the

282
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,338
breed is more likely to be like yeah

283
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,139
I'll give that a go oh so there was a

284
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,260
few considerations at play but I thought

285
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:15,480
like it could work and at the time I was

286
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,360
like and even up until a bit more

287
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,759
recently I um I was like toying with

288
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,620
like stand-up comedy and so like I sort

289
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,819
of had an idea of how to talk to people

290
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,620
and

291
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,760
um how to make it work so I just thought

292
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,500
let's just let's just try to blend it

293
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,819
all together oh and then the final thing

294
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,039
was

295
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,200
um I I've always enjoyed producing music

296
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,360
in my spare time I like playing music I

297
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,240
like writing music so I had like the

298
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,879
audio know-how to be able to like put so

299
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,560
I I was really lucky in that I sort of

300
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,259
felt like there was these three or four

301
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,259
different pieces of the puzzle and I

302
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,059
just like coincidentally had them all so

303
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,740
I was like okay I can on a technical

304
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,219
level I could make the show and all that

305
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,680
so yeah I'm emailing people

306
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,060
responses from people and um then I

307
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,019
eventually just started talking to Duke

308
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:06,000
diamond and he uh was sort of obviously

309
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,259
incredibly generous and nice with his

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,958
time

311
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,879
um but he sort of I asked enough

312
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,699
questions that he was like okay like I

313
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,379
don't think this is gonna be terrible

314
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,300
and he jumped on and and we did that

315
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,278
first episode and it sort of all went

316
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,139
from there and I have to be honest I

317
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,059
never anticipated it was going to be as

318
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,120
successful as it was I remember I sent

319
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:30,899
the first episode to my friends

320
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,519
and like cannabis friends and um and

321
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,679
they're all like oh yeah that's really

322
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,720
cool man like um where'd you find it or

323
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,159
whatever and I was like oh that's me and

324
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
at the time they'd never heard my voice

325
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,399
so they didn't and they're like that's

326
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
not you and I was like yeah yeah like

327
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,539
seriously I'm gonna I'm gonna try to do

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,278
this show you know and um so it was a

329
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:50,759
huge surprise to all of us that it went

330
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,740
so well but um definitely a labor of

331
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,939
love and one that sort of really took

332
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,000
off

333
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,360
um with a lot of its own momentum

334
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,039
that's really really cool dude I had no

335
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,740
idea that you did any of the audio

336
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,659
editing or anything like that

337
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,759
um you said you were musical as well

338
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:11,219
what do you play

339
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:15,958
uh yeah look I I try to be in my spare

340
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:19,259
time I am I I play guitar and I play uh

341
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:22,859
bass and on a good day I like to think I

342
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:26,220
can play drums and on a very good day I

343
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,259
I can maybe play a bit of piano so

344
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,360
um nothing I'm sure I'm sure everyone

345
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,860
out there who plays an instrument could

346
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,539
probably play it better than me on their

347
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,639
instrument but I can play a few which is

348
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,679
helpful and then

349
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,778
um I I don't really say it too much but

350
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,159
like any of the music or anything you've

351
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,919
ever heard in the show is just like

352
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,659
stuff I've made in my spare time

353
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,278
um so so yeah I like to do a few

354
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,219
different things it just helps me um

355
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,500
relax I find I love music for that

356
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,060
are you telling me right now that all

357
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,799
the music that you hear on the podcast

358
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,199
you've created

359
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,338
yeah bro yeah the bird noise is

360
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,379
everything

361
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,060
yeah yeah yeah I mean you just record

362
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,439
that right like I just recorded that in

363
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,559
the field

364
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,839
still that's really amazing man uh I

365
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,299
don't think my audio skills are up there

366
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,000
but I think it's really cool that you

367
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,159
and I play the exact same instruments so

368
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,759
yeah I'm not a master at any of them but

369
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:23,039
uh I would say guitar is my main you

370
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,980
know my main circumvent

371
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,360
um oh yeah but yeah are you the same

372
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,220
instruments we both dabbled in audio

373
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
before we got into this it's pretty damn

374
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,579
cool man

375
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,259
um I've got a couple questions I wanted

376
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,859
to get through really quick right here

377
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:40,259
from our patreon members

378
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,519
dank magician says what is your favorite

379
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:45,899
guest you've had a chance to interview

380
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,759
uh dank magician thank you for the

381
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:53,278
question it's one that I am always like

382
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,899
um battling myself internally because

383
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,220
I've got a bunch of favorites and people

384
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,039
always say to me like what's your

385
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,560
favorite I think undeniably a lot of

386
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,719
people really enjoyed the Chimera

387
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,239
interview because it was probably one of

388
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,639
the few interviews I did that does fall

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,698
into that more advanced category

390
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,500
and so that was quite memorable because

391
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,958
I was able to have quite a high level

392
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,000
discussion with someone about genetics

393
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,939
so that was really cool

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,139
um on a personal level I really like

395
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,019
episode 40 but I always be flowering he

396
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,399
had some very very modern takes on a lot

397
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,159
of issues

398
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,659
and I listened to it now and I could

399
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,480
totally believe it was recorded

400
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,578
yesterday like everything he says is

401
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,259
still so incredibly relevant and

402
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:42,778
accurate and he talks about strains that

403
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,939
are like still in the common Zeitgeist

404
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,860
of like hype stuff today and this

405
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,560
interview was done like three plus years

406
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,360
ago I really like that and his whole

407
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,059
thing that I took away from that was

408
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,519
like rather than getting mad at these

409
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:58,259
other dudes like you know secure your

410
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,299
own bag like you know don't get angry at

411
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,439
someone else doing it like for the most

412
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,759
part

413
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,899
um you know do your own thing so I

414
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,078
really love that

415
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:10,139
the the skunk VI episode I think is is a

416
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,719
brilliant one because uh he is a

417
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,399
fantastic Storyteller and largely

418
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,980
speaking the episode is just him

419
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,720
recounting his life story as opposed to

420
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,159
other episodes where like we'd talk a

421
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,899
little bit about your life and then like

422
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,519
a whole bunch about breeding and stuff

423
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,958
he was just largely speaking just

424
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,240
telling you his life story which I

425
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,458
thought was incredible so those ones

426
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,440
would be up there for sure but I'm also

427
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,838
going to throw out a controversial one I

428
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,800
absolutely love the Masonic one it was

429
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,800
such a uh a different perspective and I

430
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,479
try to do the show as like I try my best

431
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,000
to just

432
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,259
um not be too fussy with like there's a

433
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
lot of people who'll be like oh don't

434
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,639
get such and such on I don't like them

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,139
and I try not to listen to that sort of

436
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,600
stuff too much and just get anyone on

437
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,519
who I'm genuinely interested in and I'm

438
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,300
really glad I got Masonic on because his

439
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:02,399
views are so like contrary to the common

440
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,500
um answers you hear for questions about

441
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,078
breeding about

442
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,818
um collaborations things like that so I

443
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,459
think it was it was very different

444
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:13,740
probably very polarizing but I did enjoy

445
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,380
that one I have to admit do you know

446
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,740
we've all got what we like and what we

447
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,439
don't like but as our job as podcasters

448
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,078
is not deciphering that it's

449
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,360
interviewing these people taking in

450
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,099
their perspective and how they view the

451
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,678
world and then letting the viewers

452
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:35,279
decide for themselves you know

453
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,919
um so yeah I completely respect that uh

454
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,899
patreon members Stone stew says does he

455
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,120
remember there being named strains back

456
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,240
in the day or like where I grew up it

457
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,779
was just weed or orange Bud purple bud

458
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,779
etc etc

459
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,179
uh look I um I didn't get named weed for

460
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,119
the most part there was one or two

461
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,340
instances where I've got better quality

462
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,839
weed and I was told that it was white

463
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,298
rhino

464
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,220
more recently when I'm like you know in

465
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,980
the Cannabis scene and had some really

466
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,960
good White Rhino I can't exactly vouch

467
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,640
that the stuff I had back then was White

468
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,100
Rhino but I guess that would be

469
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,220
something which among my friends circle

470
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,439
growing up it was always touted like you

471
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,360
know bro White Rhino White Widow man

472
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,340
those are the strongest strains on Earth

473
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,500
if you can get them

474
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,839
um surprisingly I never got anything

475
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,359
that was called mullumbimby madness even

476
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,459
though I grew up not that far from about

477
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,439
two hours or so from sort of that area

478
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,600
so

479
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,400
um yeah surprisingly it never got given

480
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,339
that but yeah definitely I remember

481
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,480
White Widow White Rhino were said to be

482
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,819
the best thing ever and then I remember

483
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,919
when I turned 18 I went to Amsterdam I

484
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,720
tried white wine and right Widow and I

485
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,280
remember thinking I've had other stuff

486
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,880
here that were stronger I think so much

487
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:59,160
Sour Diesel Soma's diesel uh I thought

488
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,179
was better so there you go hopefully

489
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,179
that answers it for you my friend

490
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,400
hell yeah I have to ask for myself did

491
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:12,319
you ever have any encounters being in

492
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,320
that region to with the PNG

493
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,899
I don't in my heart of hearts I don't

494
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,179
think so I wish I wish I could have it's

495
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,179
like it's the Moby Dick man I'm chasing

496
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:27,000
it everyone says it's the best but yeah

497
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,280
I'm just not sure I got a buddy of mine

498
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,058
um who says he might have some seed

499
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,220
stock

500
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,200
but I think you'd have to grow It

501
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,819
Outdoors you know it's it's meant to be

502
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,100
so gnarly

503
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:41,939
yeah especially something that's become

504
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:44,459
acclimated to that region for so long

505
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,100
so

506
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,779
doing what you do

507
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:51,178
was there ever

508
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:53,720
any major worry about being in the

509
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,720
public eye

510
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,700
yeah I mean obviously still now but but

511
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,918
was there ever a point where you were

512
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,538
like [ __ ] maybe I should quit this or

513
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,320
maybe I should slow down did you ever

514
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:11,460
have any doubt in what you were doing

515
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:14,339
yeah a few times I think my barometer

516
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,220
has always been um my girlfriend I've

517
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,439
I've largely speaking I when I first got

518
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,839
into cannabis I was with this really

519
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,298
great girl who allowed me to do a lot of

520
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,459
growing even though she wasn't a smoker

521
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:28,440
and I I will always be grateful to her

522
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,700
for that and then I've also been with my

523
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,500
wife

524
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,700
um so over the whole time the public has

525
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,380
known me I've only ever been with those

526
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,819
two women and they would always be the

527
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,160
one who would tell me when I'm getting a

528
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,519
bit too grandiose with how many plants

529
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,419
I've gotten maybe maybe railing it in a

530
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,220
bit

531
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,559
um so I do need to give a shout out to

532
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,819
them for being the voice of reason

533
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,619
however there have certainly been times

534
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,178
where I've been concerned I've always

535
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,519
said to people look I've actually never

536
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,380
had any issues and

537
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,798
um I think the reason for that is pretty

538
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,919
simple I absolutely do not associate

539
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,319
with anyone who sells or uses hard drugs

540
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,660
now I don't want to go into the ethics

541
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,399
of like you know anything about that

542
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,840
really you know like I think drugs

543
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,940
should probably be legalized and stuff

544
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,859
but everyone I knew who ever got in

545
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,440
trouble it was always through that right

546
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:19,019
it was and so I just thought as a point

547
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,640
of precaution purely speaking I would

548
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,500
limit my Social Circle in that regard

549
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,780
and as a result I've actually never had

550
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,298
any issues and I think that sort of

551
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:30,599
speaks volumes for itself in a sense so

552
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:32,158
there have been times when I have been a

553
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,959
little bit worried about being a bit too

554
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,640
public like maybe you know the podcast

555
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,860
is out there you know the Australian

556
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,360
police could look it up and decide maybe

557
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,339
they want to try to find out who does

558
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,699
that but I don't think they are because

559
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:46,500
they largely speaking um have come out

560
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,140
on the public record they've done like

561
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,579
amas on Reddit surprisingly

562
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,659
um but they've done amas and people have

563
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:53,759
asked them you know like do you troll

564
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,860
through the Cannabis subreddits did you

565
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,298
draw through cannabis forums blah blah

566
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:58,979
and they were just like we don't have

567
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:00,720
the resources you know like we're too

568
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,679
busy trying to stop murders and rapes

569
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,298
and

570
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,640
um if something gets put in our lap if

571
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:07,319
if if your neighbor calls us up and says

572
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,179
they saw it like sure we'll do something

573
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,879
but we're not we're not putting any

574
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,980
resources into it and so for me I think

575
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,020
that bit of knowledge in combination

576
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,779
with that little bit of precaution I

577
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,639
take is largely speaking being able to

578
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,200
steer me pretty keep me on the pretty

579
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,940
straight and narrow so to speak because

580
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,159
I'm sort of like

581
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,179
not really bothering anyone and like I

582
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,919
oh and the other thing I should mention

583
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,019
is like I don't sell weed that's like a

584
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,880
big thing I think for me which helps

585
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,918
um like I don't sell any weed period

586
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,340
like I sell seeds but I don't sell weed

587
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,400
so I think that helps as well because um

588
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:43,918
yeah it's a different clientele

589
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,720
yeah it's a good mindset to have

590
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,059
and that's that's been something that's

591
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,919
helped me out as well you know

592
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:53,279
um obviously it's much more accepted

593
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,500
over here but where you know back in the

594
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,079
underground days I didn't there was no

595
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,460
regard just a plant count if you were

596
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,839
going to get busted with 10 you were

597
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,079
going to get busted with a hundred you

598
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,819
were going away either way no problem

599
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,678
um so where there was kind of disregard

600
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,418
for that then it kind of came into this

601
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,919
podcasting and everybody's like oh when

602
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,780
are you gonna be you know hunting you

603
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,720
know five different land races and [ __ ]

604
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:19,019
again like I I just don't have the heart

605
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,759
with what I'm doing now to to be like

606
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:22,798
that anymore

607
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,140
um not associating with people that do

608
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:32,038
hard drugs we definitely share that one

609
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:34,559
in common and uh I am a firm advocate of

610
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:36,000
um decriminalizing deep penalizing the

611
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,798
plant

612
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,140
um where it's not something that anybody

613
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,119
profits off of sure there's offshoots

614
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,640
like podcasts and things like that but

615
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,678
the actual product itself I would rather

616
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
see it like tomatoes in your garden than

617
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,919
anything else and I'd rather see

618
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,359
Neighbors sharing it amongst each other

619
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,860
you know you want to try some of the

620
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,779
sour diesel you want to try some of this

621
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,459
Rude Boy whatever

622
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,200
um and that's how it should be it should

623
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,960
be a gift it should be something that's

624
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,880
shared and that's kind of my perspective

625
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,940
on it

626
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,100
yeah man fully fully I am it's an

627
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,960
interesting one I still am not sure 100

628
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,399
where I land on that one but what I can

629
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,400
definitely say for sure is it seems like

630
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,798
the 215 model was Superior to what

631
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,840
Australia has now or

632
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,000
um what California has now like you know

633
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,619
where like home Growers are supplying

634
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,359
dispensaries and then other people can

635
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,819
get it from there like to me that model

636
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,500
sounded really quite sound

637
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:29,939
um and it's unfortunately not the case

638
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,679
in Australia you know there's only a few

639
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,140
big producers and they don't do a

640
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,759
particularly good job at it but

641
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,840
hopefully that changes in the future you

642
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,480
know

643
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,220
have not heard good stories yet I know a

644
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,519
couple of Australian Growers over there

645
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,740
I know a couple medical patients that uh

646
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,480
have gotten that stuff and they say

647
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,099
they'd rather get stuff off the street

648
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,538
most of the time because it was better

649
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:55,199
quality than the stuff that they were

650
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:58,619
getting uh access to

651
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,538
oh yeah yeah yeah the in my opinion it

652
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,939
is pretty well regarded as like you know

653
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,379
it's it's the general consensus the best

654
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,080
quality stuff you can get in the

655
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,419
Australian medical system is imported

656
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,460
from Canada and so what that Indica like

657
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,259
it's it's not the best you know like the

658
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,759
best is staying there we're getting I

659
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:16,500
joke around with people I say man we're

660
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,460
getting like the floor scrapings you

661
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,279
know

662
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,620
um and yet that's the best you can get

663
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,298
so it's such an indictment on the

664
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,158
quality of the domestic produced stuff

665
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:27,658
admittedly the companies are new you

666
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,980
know these Canadian companies have been

667
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,179
around a long time so they've sort of

668
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,058
got the production down a little better

669
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,679
but so much room for growth and and

670
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:36,658
there are some companies doing some cool

671
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,179
stuff in that space I've

672
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,840
um heard of a few things but yeah such a

673
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,840
long way to go

674
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:47,579
or a patreon member Greenwich says have

675
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,538
you ever interviewed anyone that pissed

676
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:52,939
you off

677
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:52,940
and you hung up if so who was it

678
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,038
no no no no that's fine I guess I guess

679
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:01,859
like let me answer that question and say

680
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,900
yeah definitely there are times when

681
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,000
people say things

682
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,159
um that I'm definitely like that's not

683
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,798
my view and

684
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,539
um I generally wouldn't I would hope

685
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,220
that you don't notice those moments

686
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,960
because my goal is that you you don't

687
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,259
pick up on that

688
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,120
um however as a point of

689
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,519
um sort of journalistic Integrity

690
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,678
something I realized very early on in

691
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,359
the show was that

692
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,220
um

693
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,319
plenty opportunities to like sort of try

694
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,579
to voice your own opinions and stuff so

695
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,200
for example I might have asked someone

696
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:36,778
to come on the show

697
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,778
and like maybe they said yes and then

698
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:42,119
like never turned up or maybe they never

699
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:44,278
replied and like there have been times

700
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,558
when I've like like anyone you know in a

701
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,538
moment of weakness you know you want to

702
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,158
leave a snarky comment or something like

703
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:52,558
that but you've got to rise above that

704
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,240
and recognize that if you say one thing

705
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,158
or if like right now I would say yeah

706
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,140
this guest said this blah blah blah then

707
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,120
any potential guest in the future will

708
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,799
will you'll sort of lose Integrity with

709
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,959
them because the guest needs to

710
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,400
ultimately trust that um you know

711
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,860
anything they're not comfortable with

712
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,059
will be removed that you know you're not

713
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,699
going to try to make them look too bad

714
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:13,678
so 100 man there there have been people

715
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,880
who have said some [ __ ] that I do not

716
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,320
agree with

717
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,200
um then unfortunately I can't tell you

718
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:22,859
their names

719
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,679
exactly much respect on that one man

720
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:28,678
so let's talk about breeding really

721
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,440
quick yeah cool that's not something I

722
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,360
knew about until fairly recently

723
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,360
how long have you been doing that

724
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:41,038
yeah good question probably the first

725
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,058
intentional seed cross I made was

726
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,019
probably

727
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:47,399
2013 2014 wow and then I don't and then

728
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,220
I don't think I made one for another

729
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,320
year or so I tested some of those seeds

730
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,620
and I just kept growing

731
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:59,339
um what I did was I did this cross very

732
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,839
early on into my growing career so I can

733
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,298
say yeah I made this cross all the way

734
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,278
back then but I then recognized that

735
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:07,798
there was no point breeding when I was

736
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,720
still growing relatively [ __ ] Bud

737
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:12,298
um and so I just needed to learn to grow

738
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,339
better weed first so basically the cross

739
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:19,440
I made was Don FM's story Amnesia

740
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:23,158
crossed to a Blue Ox mail by rare

741
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,840
dankness and I just jokingly called the

742
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,278
name blue story because it's like it

743
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,899
never got out I never really did much

744
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,339
with it so it was just easy even though

745
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,538
I'm sure there are strains called Blue

746
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:32,459
story

747
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:35,879
um anyway it was a really nice plant it

748
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,819
ended up making these um really sativa

749
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,679
bodied plants they had the strawberry

750
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:42,240
Amnesia structure

751
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,038
um but then they had like this sort of

752
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,079
Indica potency from the Blue Ox the Blue

753
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,839
Ox was like a blueberry cross to Bubba

754
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,839
Kush sort of thing so real Indica Med

755
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,959
sativa hybrid really cool plants I found

756
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,658
this one keeper Fino I still Daydream of

757
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,538
it was like um strawberry flavor with

758
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,299
like true vanilla I've never had it

759
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,819
outside of this one plant but like true

760
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:08,940
vanilla as I said I daydream about this

761
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:11,519
thing and um anyway yeah that was the

762
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,298
first cross I did and then it was um a

763
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,418
few years later at that time I was uh

764
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:20,700
studying my undergraduate degree which

765
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,559
was it was a Bachelor of Science and I

766
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,319
had two majors I did one in chemistry

767
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,178
and one in molecular biology and

768
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,980
genetics so I had an idea of what I was

769
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,659
doing but I wasn't growing great bud so

770
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,819
then I just focused on growing good bud

771
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,919
took me about a year

772
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,439
um got better progressively and then I

773
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,020
started breeding again and I'm really

774
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,580
stoked to say that some of those

775
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,859
earliest crosses are the things I'm

776
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:46,319
working on now and this would play into

777
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:48,778
something I would recommend to people

778
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,879
I I'm trying to get back to that point

779
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:53,519
because the the period of time I'm

780
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,860
talking about I didn't have as many

781
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,259
preconceived ideas about genetics back

782
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,019
then as I did now and I picked stuff

783
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:02,759
that I just it was interesting the

784
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,639
descriptions were cool it was like

785
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,679
something I'd never heard of and I truly

786
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,140
think that like some of the crosses I

787
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,480
made with that sort of stuff are the

788
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,919
most interesting to me because

789
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,599
um a lot of it was unintentional you

790
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,340
know I might have bought a certain pack

791
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,859
of seeds going yeah let's breed with

792
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,778
this and then something else happens to

793
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,038
produce a male that's really interesting

794
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:26,398
and you're like you know what this might

795
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,140
actually be better so I I encourage it

796
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,298
and I myself am trying to do it where

797
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,399
I'm trying to get back to like almost

798
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:34,379
like not looking at the breeder and just

799
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,719
reading the strain descriptions and just

800
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,080
looking at the parents and and trying to

801
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,700
just pick stuff that's different because

802
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:44,519
I'm telling people these days in regards

803
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,058
to breeding is like you know you you

804
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,359
can't compare to JB disease cushman's

805
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:52,980
reversal so so um you know don't hedge

806
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,538
your bets and try to do a cush mint

807
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,700
hybrid there's already people doing it

808
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:58,619
like maybe instead try to do something

809
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,840
that's totally different because people

810
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:04,139
will genuinely be interested if you're

811
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,759
like yay I use this blue Amnesia that is

812
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,799
strawberry Amnesia across to this Blue

813
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,480
Ox thing and you've probably never heard

814
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,278
of either of those but it's it's a nice

815
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,558
plan I assure you

816
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,898
um I think that's a way forward for

817
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,298
people who feel like we're in the corner

818
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:20,339
of genetics and are not entirely sure

819
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:23,278
where to start you know I would say

820
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:25,439
start by just picking stuff that's cool

821
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,298
that's cool that you brought that up I

822
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,080
haven't heard the Blue Ox name for a

823
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:30,418
while

824
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,278
but that was one that

825
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,980
I was really interested in it I never

826
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,480
gotta grow very much a rare dankness's

827
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,079
stuff

828
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,599
um I should say Scott uh but that Blue

829
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,699
Ox that was one that really excited me

830
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:48,000
the only one I ever grew was the ghost

831
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,620
train Haze and that one died off for me

832
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,019
after a while it was all right to begin

833
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,418
with and then it just kind of peaked out

834
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:56,759
there was another one about that time I

835
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:00,240
want to say it's called night terror

836
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:02,158
yeah yeah yep okay that one that one was

837
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,919
one that I'd probably still grow that to

838
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,860
this day I've been kind of looking at

839
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,960
no so out of everything that you've made

840
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,359
what are some of the standout ones to

841
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,058
you what are you most proud of like if I

842
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,199
was gonna say heavy days you got three

843
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,599
strains

844
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,340
that you can take and say I want this to

845
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,339
represent my genetics

846
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,980
oh great question

847
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,140
um

848
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay so

849
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,820
the first one which most people would be

850
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,679
aware of with my work would be the

851
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,980
raspberry Mama

852
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,720
um basically this is a phantom Kush F2

853
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,720
so I got a pack of phantom Kush from

854
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,980
Ken's GDP it's pink Champagne cross to

855
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,159
Ken's Kush

856
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,319
I popped the seeds I found a mother that

857
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,480
was very shamp Pink Champagne leaning

858
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:52,798
and a father that had the same structure

859
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,200
appeared to be very Pink Champagne

860
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,740
leading I bred those together

861
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,880
so I made f2s and then from that popped

862
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,259
seed found a mum that was just entirely

863
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,960
what I was looking to find right it's

864
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:10,079
just basically Pink Champagne so then I

865
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,759
got that in like 2016 and I sort of

866
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,939
established myself with it it's like

867
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:18,000
this really nice Indica cushy thing with

868
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,700
like a baked raspberry tart sort of vibe

869
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,339
a bit of champagne to it really nice

870
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,278
perfumey cannabis it's not gonna put you

871
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:27,778
to sleep but it's like to me I describe

872
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:29,579
it as the perfect afternoon weed it's

873
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,440
like it's gonna take the weight off your

874
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:33,658
shoulders but still leaving you able to

875
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,340
get up and do stuff but you're just like

876
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:37,799
oh I don't feel like it's the end of the

877
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:39,599
day I feel sort of nice and it was a

878
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,220
really good for anti-anxiety at the time

879
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,379
I was having like sort of sporadic

880
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,659
general anxiety and so it would just hit

881
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,760
it on the heads I loved it so I made

882
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,799
some hybrids with that in like 2017

883
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:54,119
maybe 2018

884
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:55,679
um 2017 I think and then um uh it was

885
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,359
only a very small limited production

886
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,038
they never got out too far but a few

887
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,019
people who got those seeds like they

888
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,278
still hang on to the cuts and a few of

889
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,599
them have made their way back to me

890
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:07,259
which is really nice

891
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:11,039
and I did hybrids I did s1s

892
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:13,858
and then I had to move and in the

893
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,059
process of moving I lost the mum and it

894
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:16,739
was crazy because I thought I had it

895
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:19,259
backed up with friends but then it turns

896
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,539
out like they had lost it as well and I

897
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,000
was shattered and I lost it and then um

898
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:26,639
fast forward a few years a good buddy of

899
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,619
mine feral genetics he popped some of

900
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,200
those seeds he popped the S1 so it turns

901
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,480
out I gave him some and I sort of forgot

902
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,739
he's like yeah man I grew them out

903
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,119
um like not only do I have them I've

904
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,678
already grown them out I didn't tell you

905
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,879
I've popped them three months ago and

906
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,519
they're ready they're ready to harvest

907
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,679
and um one of them is insane you've got

908
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,019
to come look at it and I was like oh

909
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,300
yeah because he had never seen the mum

910
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:50,460
um so I went there and I smelled I was

911
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,580
like holy [ __ ] dude that's exactly it

912
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,320
like not not nine out of ten it like 10

913
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,838
out of 10 it

914
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,359
um and more importantly it was it was

915
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,858
dark the bud was purple and I for the

916
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,299
life of me I could never have gotten

917
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:06,358
raspberry mum and go purple she was just

918
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,519
like this green cushy plant so as far as

919
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,139
I was concerned this is better because

920
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,059
it's everything the mum had but it goes

921
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:15,059
purple really easy so that was pretty

922
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:17,699
cool and um so I got that and I've been

923
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,799
doing work with that but it's still that

924
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,838
S1 he found

925
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,820
um it's still just one of my favorite

926
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,679
plants so so definitely the raspberry

927
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,119
Mama which

928
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,399
um a lot of people don't know what Pink

929
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,099
Champagne is think of like a cherry pie

930
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,400
sort of thing like a unique

931
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:37,079
um Berry tart perfume sort of vibe so

932
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,059
it's similar to Cherry Pie in my opinion

933
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,240
so that would be the Phantom uh the

934
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:46,259
raspberry Mama the next one would be the

935
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:50,098
jelly breath that I found from in-house

936
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,740
genetics I've then worked that into a

937
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,240
bx2 line

938
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:56,719
so that would be the other one because

939
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,578
it's a really solid line

940
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:02,039
in-house has done his own jelly breath

941
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:04,560
work but it uses a different cutting and

942
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,838
I've spoken to both him and the guy who

943
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,000
found the cutting two-tone Willies it's

944
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,400
called the North Cascade cut of jelly

945
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,159
breath anyway mine's totally different

946
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,660
they're one

947
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,879
yeah yeah so it's like more of like a

948
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:20,639
dosey doe leaning Fina or like a 50 50

949
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,700
whereas my jelly breath is is almost 100

950
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,319
Mendo breath dominant so it's it's a

951
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,539
very different plant despite having the

952
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,160
same name and so my jelly breath work is

953
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:30,719
quite different to in-house's jelly

954
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,379
breath work

955
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,939
um

956
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,519
but that would be the other one so the

957
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,440
bx2 which is really cool

958
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,480
um and admittedly that is um you know

959
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,740
obviously in-house's work but I I feel

960
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,260
like I've worked it into a pretty

961
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:46,078
consistent bx2 line this particular Fino

962
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,780
and then the final one would be the dog

963
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,820
jelly which I made more recently using

964
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,339
that jelly breath mother I referenced

965
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,559
and then Crossing it to some seed stock

966
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,199
I was incredibly lucky to get

967
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,858
um our buddy Duke Diamond so he gave me

968
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:03,358
a chemd across to the Local H and I

969
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:04,980
think he said to me he only gave it to

970
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,380
like three or four people and I was one

971
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,358
I found a really nice male I hit it to

972
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,180
the Jelly breath and made this strainer

973
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,338
called Dog jelly and it's beautiful man

974
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:17,159
it's like cookies and like super loud

975
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:19,078
chem dog and gassy it's it's a really

976
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,539
special one to me and I've done my best

977
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,220
to really get those clones out I found a

978
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,539
few thinos that were really nice and

979
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,179
I've been giving them out to people all

980
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:28,679
around Australia and um I'm starting to

981
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,879
see it pop up more and more and I think

982
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,078
it would be really cool to get it out

983
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,579
more so I'm going to sort of do my best

984
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,460
to do that so that would be my three

985
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:38,099
jelly breath bx2 the raspberry mama and

986
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,280
the dog jelly and do you have those

987
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:42,240
available in both regs and femmes

988
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,560
because I know that you were doing

989
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,019
Femmes

990
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,940
yeah great question man so

991
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:49,619
um I I have done the Femmes and when I

992
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,900
was talking about historically having

993
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:54,720
done the raspberry mum Femmes that made

994
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,700
the s1s which then gave birth to the

995
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,338
plant I use now

996
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:01,858
um I made all the crosses back then with

997
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:05,219
the intention of trying to do reg

998
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:06,659
versions of them thereafter so at the

999
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:09,059
moment as you referenced I've I've

1000
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,399
femmed to keep a mother onto my other

1001
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:14,159
keeper mothers and you got the Femme

1002
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,700
crosses but I'm also in the process of

1003
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:20,039
working regular lines of those out

1004
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:21,659
um I do regular crosses in general you

1005
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,639
know I've done some different work with

1006
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:26,399
some different males but I specifically

1007
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:28,559
wanted to do like a male a regular

1008
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,260
release of the Femme line I released

1009
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,960
because I was lucky enough

1010
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,540
um when my buddy found that S1 of the

1011
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,358
the female he also found like a male in

1012
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,980
that pack and we were sort of quite

1013
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,199
suspicious at first and we were like

1014
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,019
maybe it's like pollen contamination

1015
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,539
Maybe some weird but we sort of stress

1016
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:51,300
test this male and it dead set would not

1017
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:53,159
show you what sex it was until you

1018
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,579
actually put it into flour and let it go

1019
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,139
for a few weeks so my thought process is

1020
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,460
like there's a there's a chance it's a

1021
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,980
small chance but there's a chance that

1022
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,019
is in fact a male from Femme stock which

1023
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:07,019
is known to happen Sam the skunk man

1024
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:09,300
spoke about it and um very low chance

1025
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:11,699
you know you're only meant to see that

1026
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,260
oh cool right oh man maybe you can tell

1027
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:14,699
me about it because I'm just trying to

1028
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,980
figure out if it's real or not really

1029
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:17,819
but yeah

1030
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,699
I mean

1031
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,980
you never know what's unless you're

1032
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:24,419
packaging them yourself if you were in

1033
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,159
that grow yourself you don't know what

1034
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,079
happened maybe a bean rolled off the

1035
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,299
counter from a different one you don't

1036
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,260
know what their process is like but I

1037
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,619
have definitely had a six-pack of Femmes

1038
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,720
um I believe that was

1039
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,760
I think those were Alaskan Thunder [ __ ]

1040
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:43,919
and

1041
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,359
one or two of them popped up mail I

1042
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,740
think it was just one I think it was

1043
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,420
just the one

1044
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,159
cool

1045
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,659
did you ever do anything with it or it

1046
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,239
was just sort of like a cool Oh no I got

1047
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,739
rid of it right away yeah I know I was

1048
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,559
like well that's not what I was looking

1049
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,199
for I mean most that that market in

1050
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,480
itself the feminized seeds those people

1051
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,419
are looking for a very specific thing

1052
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,639
you know these are people with low plant

1053
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,980
counts or that just want to guarantee

1054
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,858
females in their grow so when that pops

1055
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,699
up it was just automatic no no not at

1056
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,400
all

1057
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:20,639
yeah no I can appreciate that for sure

1058
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,760
but yeah looking looking to maybe cross

1059
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,699
that mail to the same mothers and then

1060
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,920
see do those resulting seeds bear any

1061
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:31,078
resemblance to the feminized ones I made

1062
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,059
obviously it's a different plant but

1063
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,240
it's from the same strain so you'd think

1064
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:38,099
like it should be like just some basic

1065
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,838
similarities just enough enough to be

1066
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:41,940
able to be like yeah that doesn't seem

1067
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,159
like it's contaminated pollen and it's

1068
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,260
totally something different

1069
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,759
can I ask you a very controversial

1070
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,220
question

1071
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,460
hit it let's do it

1072
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:56,659
how do you feel about breeding regular

1073
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,639
seeds with feminized seeds

1074
00:40:56,659 --> 00:41:02,759
I look I think the devil's in the detail

1075
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:05,940
right but as as a rule of thumb I would

1076
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,540
say that it appears fairly certain from

1077
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,940
empirical evidence that you can breed

1078
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,739
like you can get a mother from Femme

1079
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,440
stock and then fem that onto other stuff

1080
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,479
doesn't seem to inherently increase the

1081
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,420
rates of hermaphrodism you can

1082
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,579
selectively see it but it you don't see

1083
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,039
it across the board because people like

1084
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:29,300
canarado that's his whole business model

1085
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:31,679
is like make a series of Femme hybrids

1086
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,480
phenohundham the best one is the one we

1087
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,539
reverse for the next round of Femme

1088
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,719
hybrids we make and the same is said for

1089
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:41,699
compound genetics and it just doesn't

1090
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,439
seem that the empirical evidence is

1091
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,118
there that enough people are putting

1092
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,338
their hands up and saying hey this is

1093
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,559
like I'm getting at least one home a

1094
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,838
pack or something you know and I sort of

1095
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,578
joke around with people and say that I

1096
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,920
think you should honestly go into every

1097
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:58,920
phenohunt with the expectation that one

1098
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,599
plant will have term because a it's not

1099
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,338
that high of a bar you know you should

1100
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,140
give people a little bit of slack you

1101
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:06,599
know plants harm every now and again and

1102
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:08,759
it just happens but on top of that any

1103
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,640
more than that and you can start to have

1104
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,680
some um you know questions that are not

1105
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,480
unreasonable to be asking you know if

1106
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,159
you're getting two herbs in a pack maybe

1107
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,599
there is something unstable about those

1108
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,159
genetics but

1109
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,260
um and then if you're getting 10 herbs

1110
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,259
in a pack it's probably on you bro check

1111
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,720
the light leaks but um uh yeah it's

1112
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:30,660
definitely an interesting topic I do

1113
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:33,239
suspect that if you femmed on to famed

1114
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:36,539
onto Femme for like forever

1115
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:39,358
then like yeah you might see some

1116
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:41,279
deviation in the way the genes Express

1117
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,440
themselves in terms of sexual stability

1118
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,900
but I don't think we're there long term

1119
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,539
and it seems as though like enough sort

1120
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,760
of Femme stuff happens that you know if

1121
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:52,980
it is if it is increasing the rates of

1122
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,320
hermaphrodism it's happening very slowly

1123
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,440
and we haven't in my opinion we haven't

1124
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,859
yet truly detected it and

1125
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,440
um I think it's just more anecdotal you

1126
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:06,719
know like I I honest to God feel like I

1127
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,818
I get less homes now than I ever have

1128
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,578
maybe that's a reflection of my

1129
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:14,759
environment being more dialed but um

1130
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:17,940
yeah at the moment I would happily pop

1131
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,460
seeds that are like femin to Femme and I

1132
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,900
would happily make those sorts of seeds

1133
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,940
and sell them

1134
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,858
um so long as I was confident they were

1135
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,900
stable and that everyone sort of knew

1136
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:30,358
what they were in my most recent seed

1137
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,000
release that I did the sort of version

1138
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,980
twos of the raspberry Mumma fans I

1139
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,980
wanted to make it very clear that the

1140
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,260
plant I was reversing was an S1 you know

1141
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,300
so I I think I did make that very clear

1142
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,980
in a number of ways

1143
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,720
um in terms of like if you read the

1144
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,300
descriptions on the posts and the actual

1145
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,679
infographics and all that but yeah I

1146
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,839
just think like as long as you're

1147
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,179
upfront about it like this that that is

1148
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,759
really up to the consumer to decide and

1149
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:59,338
I myself as a consumer

1150
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,260
um don't I I would run Canada I would

1151
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:03,838
run compound I don't think it's going to

1152
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,780
be home City so to speak

1153
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,779
very very good answer and I appreciate

1154
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,000
your honesty on that one okay one of our

1155
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,000
patreon members dank magician wants to

1156
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,280
know uh what solution do you use for

1157
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,358
your reversals

1158
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,819
nice one good question I have used uh

1159
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,619
Matt Wright's reversal spray in the past

1160
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:28,259
and had success with it I would

1161
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:31,980
recommend that spray I more recently

1162
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,140
have used a local option which was

1163
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,000
um just in the past when I've used matte

1164
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:37,679
spray it's been very successful for me

1165
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,059
but it comes from America you know it

1166
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,980
takes a few weeks to arrive and

1167
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,960
sometimes I'm not as organized as I

1168
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,639
should be and I don't have a few weeks

1169
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,199
unfortunately

1170
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,358
um so I've been using some more local

1171
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:52,199
options which I've had some good success

1172
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:53,098
with my buddy has a company called

1173
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,118
um

1174
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:58,980
uh old sod's reversal spray and that's

1175
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,740
an australian-based company that you can

1176
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,500
use who do a really nice STS solution

1177
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:06,059
it's made fresh when you order it

1178
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,219
um and you can also have the option of

1179
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:09,960
mixing it yourself if you'd like I've

1180
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,239
had good success with that

1181
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,119
um and I've also used another product by

1182
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,739
a buddy of mine uh called feral genetics

1183
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,019
I've mentioned him a few times he also

1184
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,979
sells an STS solution

1185
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:22,559
um I think that's a slightly different

1186
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,940
formulation and I've had success with

1187
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,619
both of those products so if you're an

1188
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,880
Australian person definitely check out

1189
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:30,059
those two guys they've got great

1190
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,358
products I would be really interested in

1191
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:36,900
using hybratex solution which is the

1192
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:40,980
cobalt chloride solution as opposed to a

1193
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,599
sodium thiosulfate so yeah so I I'm Keen

1194
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,039
to give the cobalt chloride solution a

1195
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,140
go I've heard nothing but great things

1196
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:48,539
about hypertext product which is that

1197
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,639
but I've also had great success with STS

1198
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:52,318
I've never used colloidal silver and I

1199
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,239
don't think I ever will because

1200
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,739
um I I just hear like it's it's a bit

1201
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,618
finicky the application you've got to

1202
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:00,719
use it Con instantly and um yeah just

1203
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:04,740
seems like less efficient to me

1204
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:06,779
how often are you using that one

1205
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:09,419
uh sorry which one are we talking about

1206
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,819
specifically the one that uh did you say

1207
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,338
you were using the Cobalt recently

1208
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:16,800
no I would like to use that but I

1209
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:20,219
haven't but apparently it's literally a

1210
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,839
once application I've spoken to

1211
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:23,879
I can't remember who it was it might

1212
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:27,119
have been right

1213
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,059
so they all say one time but

1214
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,240
um I I tend to use an STS spray a couple

1215
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:35,940
of times just to really ensure you're

1216
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:39,059
saturating all those nodes because it's

1217
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,500
really like that axial branching node

1218
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:44,519
point that you really want to try to

1219
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:46,858
saturate so I I I go against the rules

1220
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:49,079
and I apply STS a few times and I don't

1221
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:51,179
see any negatives to it and I like to

1222
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,760
think it slightly increases my chances

1223
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,318
getting a successful reversal

1224
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,359
um however I've been told I'm quite good

1225
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,759
authority that that Cobalt one you

1226
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:02,519
really only need to apply it one time as

1227
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,500
hybrotech advertisers because apparently

1228
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,960
like it stresses the plan out a bit if

1229
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,699
you um if you applied a number of times

1230
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,559
I've seen some very frazzled looking

1231
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:12,719
plants and the other thing to quickly

1232
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,858
mention because you know people may not

1233
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,959
know this until they've done a few

1234
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:18,059
reversals the first reversal I ever did

1235
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,280
went reasonably successful in the grand

1236
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:21,838
scheme of things and then the next two I

1237
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,760
did went horrible and so I went into

1238
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,338
them thinking this is easy I've done

1239
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,780
before it worked like I just sprayed it

1240
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:29,818
and it just worked

1241
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,560
um and so it's worth noting that like

1242
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:33,960
when you reverse a plant to make

1243
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:35,818
feminized seeds it's sort of it's not

1244
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,740
like a binary outcome it's not like oh

1245
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:40,318
this plant successfully reversed or this

1246
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:42,358
plant didn't it's usually like oh

1247
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,159
there's some bananas but mostly female

1248
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:46,139
buds or it's like

1249
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,879
all the way through to there's no

1250
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:50,219
bananas and on the other end of the

1251
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,760
spectrum it's expressing as if it's an

1252
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:56,578
entirely male plant and so it truly is

1253
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,680
important to reverse a couple planets

1254
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:01,079
um I would say three is a good number

1255
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,838
and you'll be fairly certain to get one

1256
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,160
that will reverse really nicely and

1257
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,440
you'll just get like that male

1258
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,299
morphology and it's just damp and pollen

1259
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,579
that's what you want

1260
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,920
um because I've had like two that have

1261
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:15,900
just sort of like not really got there

1262
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,240
they're not really releasing much pollen

1263
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,300
at all and it's like a failed reversal

1264
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,979
and so keep that in mind and if you are

1265
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,980
making feminine seeds anyone out there

1266
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:28,858
always have a male backup Mass medical

1267
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:32,579
taught me this and it's true because

1268
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:34,019
um I I did this femrun and the Femme

1269
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,599
failed and I had a I had a different

1270
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:38,519
strain I was also spraying and I was

1271
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,619
like if if the the main one doesn't work

1272
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,659
I use the backup one and the backup one

1273
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:45,119
didn't work either so like at the end of

1274
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,159
the day yeah the the end of the day you

1275
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,380
need a mail that you know will produce

1276
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:52,500
pollen on cue if it's in the right light

1277
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,119
cycle so um yeah that would be a bit of

1278
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,760
advice too otherwise you'll end up

1279
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,039
getting a Scentsy crop when maybe you're

1280
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,260
hoping to have some seeds

1281
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:04,679
very very good answer

1282
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:06,480
so we have a few more minutes here so

1283
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:08,759
I'm going to ask you a few more

1284
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,880
questions I wanted to get into

1285
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:15,780
the other controversial one really quick

1286
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,539
which is how do you feel about testing

1287
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,440
yeah great question

1288
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,719
um

1289
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,420
like just to make sure we're talking the

1290
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:29,480
right thing like THC contents and stuff

1291
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,480
no testing uh your genetics or stability

1292
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:39,299
no there's no hard and fast rule but I

1293
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,338
think that it's important to be very

1294
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,099
upfront with what you're doing so for

1295
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:47,880
example the most recent raspberry Mama

1296
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:50,220
release I did I had not finished

1297
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,079
flowering out those plants yet because

1298
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:56,219
they were remakes I had already made

1299
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,800
those crosses a few years ago so in that

1300
00:49:56,219 --> 00:50:00,719
situation I didn't really felt like it

1301
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,160
was going to achieve much more than what

1302
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,480
I already had in terms of the

1303
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,279
information because it was like I'm just

1304
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,880
doing the V2s

1305
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,859
um so that situation is one where I felt

1306
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,980
comfortable for it to go out and then

1307
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:15,900
when I did that

1308
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,519
seed run I had some new mothers in the

1309
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,900
room and those ones didn't really go out

1310
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,940
because I'm still testing those now

1311
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,160
because I'm just some of them others are

1312
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,960
new I'm not as familiar with them I

1313
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:26,818
remember I was talking to JJ from Top

1314
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,500
Dog genetics a while ago and he said

1315
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:30,838
something that lasted with me which is

1316
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:34,500
like you probably should test everything

1317
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:36,779
right but for someone like him if he's

1318
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,818
got like a certain Tres dog male he's

1319
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,579
been breeding with for like five years

1320
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:43,559
he sort of knows how that male is

1321
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:46,560
generally going to interact with things

1322
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,420
and so I'd be happy to accept if someone

1323
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,759
said to me hey look I've got this mail

1324
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,500
I've had for a number of years I've done

1325
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,240
a few different lines with it like a few

1326
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,780
different releases like you know maybe

1327
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:59,578
20 strains in total with it and I I know

1328
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,140
what it works with I could probably tell

1329
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:04,318
you it's not going to pair well with

1330
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:06,239
these sorts of strains they tend to her

1331
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,099
um I could accept that and be like yeah

1332
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,379
that that's I'm happy to accept that

1333
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,700
that's reasonable empirical evidence but

1334
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,619
I think that if you're making some

1335
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:14,338
totally new stuff

1336
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,280
um

1337
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:19,318
it's important to test it not from

1338
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,780
necessarily the consumer point of view

1339
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,119
because as Masonic does he's so upfront

1340
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,400
I don't test anything like you know like

1341
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,920
it's not tested but I'm charging you

1342
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,280
this price take it or leave it

1343
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:35,039
um however the reason why I think you

1344
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,680
should test it is because it takes five

1345
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,739
years to build your reputation and five

1346
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:43,139
minutes to destroy it and um I think

1347
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:45,299
that's what is really at risk is your

1348
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,838
reputation because

1349
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,640
um

1350
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:50,400
you know at the end of the day I don't

1351
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:52,078
like if someone stuff Herms on me it it

1352
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,200
is what it is you know I'm never gonna

1353
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,119
get that time back so it's sort of a

1354
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,219
live and learn thing so I think that

1355
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,358
it's it's it's tough one because and

1356
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,219
this is the other thing you know if

1357
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,019
someone grows your seeds and they Herm

1358
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,000
and you're like oh hey I'd like to make

1359
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:07,380
it better and send you some seeds they

1360
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,880
probably don't want to grow more of your

1361
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,160
seeds out

1362
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,660
um and so it does leave you in a tough

1363
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:14,159
position as a breeder because you might

1364
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:16,379
be like oh I'd love to make that right

1365
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:20,578
for you but it's um I'm not exactly sure

1366
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,019
what so yeah it's um it's it's an

1367
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,359
interesting one to navigate that

1368
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:25,858
Minefield but I think above all as long

1369
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,139
as you're honest no one can really

1370
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:30,179
criticize you and if you want to make

1371
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,219
sure you don't end up with egg on your

1372
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:34,558
face maybe you should test but you don't

1373
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:38,338
necessarily need to

1374
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:41,099
everybody has their own goals absolutely

1375
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:43,318
um before we get going here buddy I

1376
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:46,920
wanted to ask you

1377
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:50,219
aside from things that you've created

1378
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:54,420
what are your top three favorite types

1379
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:58,739
of cannabis that you've smoked today

1380
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:59,700
uh what a great question man all right

1381
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:01,919
um

1382
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:04,199
I I used to have as I mentioned earlier

1383
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,940
I used to have very bad anxiety like

1384
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,318
generalized anxiety so it sort of just

1385
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,920
come on sporadically nothing

1386
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:13,380
specifically triggering it and for that

1387
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,000
reason I struggled with sativas I just

1388
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,780
couldn't handle them

1389
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,300
um

1390
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,339
however as I got over that that was

1391
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,760
probably about eight years ago as I got

1392
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:25,799
over that I began to enjoy sativas now

1393
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,660
to the point where it's like they're

1394
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,400
they're definitely my favorite and um

1395
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,779
they're probably I can probably honestly

1396
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,480
say there will come a time when I will

1397
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:37,559
only smoke sativas probably

1398
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,838
um and so as a result some of my

1399
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,720
absolute favorite varieties are like

1400
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,039
unique sativas

1401
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,039
um I think

1402
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:49,219
death

1403
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:52,318
definitely if I had to give you three

1404
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:54,179
genius from Brothers Grim is one of the

1405
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,539
most memorable clones I've been able to

1406
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:59,940
smoke it was unlike 90 of sativas out

1407
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:03,239
there it was it was um uplifting and

1408
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:06,599
cerebral but it was very clear-headed it

1409
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:08,818
was very focused sensitive is like Cindy

1410
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:10,740
99 you smoke them and it's great but

1411
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:12,179
every 10 seconds you're like what was I

1412
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:15,659
doing again because you got that

1413
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:17,879
fogginess but um genius was the opposite

1414
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:20,338
the name fit man makes you feel like a

1415
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,920
genius so clear-headed and focused and

1416
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:26,578
that was one for sure I've got to give a

1417
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,700
huge shout out to um like Jack Harris

1418
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:33,119
Super Silver Haze it's probably gonna

1419
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:35,879
get me uh clowned on a bit but being

1420
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,920
someone who didn't live in America I've

1421
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,260
never been burnt out on jakara I've had

1422
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,900
some incredible samples of Jack Herer

1423
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,640
and I think to me super silver haze that

1424
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:48,180
keep a cut that you see floating around

1425
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,940
is in that same vein of like very racy

1426
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:54,118
very uplifting

1427
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:55,500
Piney terpenly indominant sativas I

1428
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,720
really really enjoy that this is

1429
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,239
probably a very like unexpected answer

1430
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:03,058
but like I love that [ __ ] but the final

1431
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,818
one would be

1432
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:07,559
um I had most years when I've come over

1433
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:09,659
to the states I've been lucky enough to

1434
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:12,839
spend the night before I go home I would

1435
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:14,399
usually spend it at Bodie's house and I

1436
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:16,920
would just get to smoke all this crazy

1437
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,440
land race [ __ ] and then um jump on the

1438
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,119
plane all buzzed and fly home and he

1439
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,519
gave me

1440
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,559
I believe it was Vietnamese number seven

1441
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,900
it's he posts about it on his Instagram

1442
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:29,519
you can see it if you check it out

1443
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,559
um you'll find it Vietnamese number

1444
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,880
seven it's like you know he popped who

1445
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,559
knows how many Vietnamese seeds and that

1446
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,358
was the number seven some of the most

1447
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:40,079
unique weed I've ever had in my life

1448
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:43,019
like so legitimately giggly like nothing

1449
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,318
is giggly compared to this stuff like

1450
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:48,000
uh my dream would be to like do a comedy

1451
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,639
show and to force everyone to smoke this

1452
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,300
on the way in it would be insane but um

1453
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:57,118
yes so uplifting so fun yeah one of a

1454
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:01,318
kind that's a great answer man that's

1455
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:04,980
cool uh we're both musicians who both

1456
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:07,318
appreciate sativas you do the comedy the

1457
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,318
[ __ ] I've been searching for giggly

1458
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:11,818
weed that's something

1459
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:13,920
that I feel that's been lost throughout

1460
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:16,079
time you know something that's really

1461
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,680
been bred out I can't say I've had any

1462
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,760
modern cultivars I don't I don't truly

1463
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,299
believe

1464
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,040
that it's something

1465
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,980
that you can find in a lot of modern

1466
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:30,599
cannabis anymore because everything that

1467
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:33,119
affected me that way I don't think it

1468
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:36,079
was a tolerance to build up to THC that

1469
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:39,180
did it I think it was a certain

1470
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:42,660
endocannabinoid profile that

1471
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:45,419
made that you know that effect

1472
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:47,879
um and I get it with some ties and

1473
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,139
that's why I appreciate ties so much but

1474
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,260
that is something that I've heard about

1475
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:54,299
the Vietnamese and that's a reason that

1476
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,980
I've been kind of looking that out do

1477
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,318
you know if that was the Vietnamese gold

1478
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:01,318
or the Vietnamese black or

1479
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,318
but

1480
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,139
sorry excuse me

1481
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,660
um I I

1482
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,779
honestly don't know it was green so I

1483
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:15,118
don't think it was the Vietnamese black

1484
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,819
um I think he said that it was like a

1485
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,099
low land Vietnamese he said he thinks of

1486
00:57:17,818 --> 00:57:21,838
them as like either Highland or lowland

1487
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:23,460
I think from memory he said it was low

1488
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,980
land

1489
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,659
um so maybe the highlands turn purple or

1490
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,740
something in there the Vietnamese blacks

1491
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:32,399
or

1492
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:34,019
um I'm not 100 sure but I have had a

1493
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,900
bunch of um

1494
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:39,059
ties a bunch of different stuff I had a

1495
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,480
very memorable tie from Bodhi actually

1496
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:45,599
it looked exactly Picture Perfect like

1497
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,280
that Infamous photo of um Dr grinspoon

1498
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,440
with like just the single alternating

1499
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,160
calyxes

1500
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:56,700
um yeah it was it was really cool stuff

1501
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:58,440
equally special uplifting fun

1502
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,719
um yeah really cool stuff and I think

1503
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:04,200
when I spoke to Bodhi as well he said

1504
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:07,019
that largely speaking the the strains

1505
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:09,960
um just move around in those areas and

1506
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:13,019
so like Vietnamese Thai it's like it's

1507
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,300
it could be very interchangeable really

1508
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:17,400
similar regions

1509
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,980
yeah it's very cool man and that's

1510
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,400
something I definitely want to look into

1511
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:25,139
