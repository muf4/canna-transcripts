oh the scent stuff i had a headache for

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,560
a while the whole house smelled like um

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,200
like artificial grape all night

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,280
yeah that was fun though it was very

43
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,280
interesting and and informative

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,959
did any of you guys pick up a kit after

45
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
to try it i really want to do another

46
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
episode where a bunch of us have kits

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
and we can all do it so you guys can all

48
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
type in here like what's going on with

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,680
your smelling etc

50
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,679

having a look

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,598
whatever they are they're probably worth

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
it you know because they're they're

55
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:01,840
pretty

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,719

127
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,038

128
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,840

129
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,839

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,199
you know

138

i get sick of staring at my [ __ ] head

139
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,240
[Music]

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
i'm staying sober for this one too

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
because

142
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,959
chimera talks

143
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,478
way over my head the guy is brilliant

144
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,598
and when it comes to

145
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,680
science

146
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,360
it's really hard to find anyone who is

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,439
as confident with

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,720
science and breeding science when it

149
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,038
comes to that as him so i'm trying to

150
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,800
try to keep my [ __ ] together today

151
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,519
i have not tested out the purple pro yet

152
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,439
um i know i know csi got one but i don't

153
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,279
know i don't think he's had even time to

154
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,759
touch it or use it or not do anything

155
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,758
with it yet

156
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,319
is the s or c silent word in the word

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,319
sent

158
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,359
god that's a good one

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
all the bb stuff you've done anything

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,240
without cast cut from nugs and jug days

161
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,240
i have not no one ever passed it um

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,478

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,000
when you sip your tea this is coffee

164
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,918

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,759
because yesterday i drink full calf

166
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,439
coffee it was up all night

167
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
steep hill labs do can of annoying terp

168
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,120
testing

169
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,720
i don't know much about any of the labs

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,720
which is a reason why we're doing the

trying to make it more professional

196
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,958
because uh we're doing the 2.0 of reader

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
syndicate and everything so

198
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,879

we'll get jamming

200
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,600
gotcha

welcome to breach of syndicate where we

202
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,639
explore the history of a clandestine

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,560
scene through the eyes of the folks who

204
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,480
lived it i'm matt the owner of riot

205

seeds this is chimera

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
owner of chimera seeds

207
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,639
uh

208
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
yeah

209
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,958
welcome to the underground that is so

210
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
professional yeah you like that yeah i

211
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,239
really really like the game

212
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,879
do we have some uh is there a good place

213
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
to look up the labs aspect

214
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,519
like different labs that i could put i

215
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,879
have my tablet right here yeah

216
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,919
i'm wondering the best way to do this

217
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,720
you know what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna

218
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,838
send you a text message with a sample

219
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,278
okay um a report that for a report

220
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
format that i have a little bit to do

221
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,759
with

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,799
um the

223
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,319
designing the way it is but really

224
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,639
we can use anything right the important

225
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,278
thing is that we go through a lab report

226
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,278
lab report and show people

227
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,759
what are the things to look at

228
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,200
what can you like obviously in a lab

229
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,200
report there's all this built-in

230
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
information right

231
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,920
so how can you take that information and

232
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
essentially infer things about the

233
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,319
results or see if you can identify

234
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,720
problems

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
with what the lab has done yeah right

236
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
and so you know what you sent me the

237
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,679
other day and i think you got those

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,360
posted on your ig or something yeah yeah

239
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,958
they're posted on the ig yeah so people

240
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
can check those out either now or later

241
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,439
but

242
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,879
you know

243
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
like i said one of the things i said to

244
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,399
you back then was that um

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
it wasn't really

246
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,919
like that was those were results that

247
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,480
somebody had cut and pasted into a

248
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,479
spreadsheet yes yeah so that's an

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,159
opportunity for like anybody manipulate

250
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
them yeah yeah anybody can [ __ ] with it

251
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,759
at that point yeah in an excel

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,240
spreadsheet eventually

253
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,159
like a legal document in a way

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
yeah well they are they are legal

255
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,799
documents oh they are legal documents

256
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,078
yeah

257
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,519
i didn't know that

258
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,799
especially when it comes to like you

259
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,399
know obviously there's all this

260
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,078
environmental testing that needs to be

261
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,360
done but yes in the context of

262
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,359
regulations like these are these are

263
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,839
legal documents that certify something

264
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
for the purpose of regulations that's

265
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,200
right yeah so that makes sense it's gone

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,720
to like a good standard right yeah

267
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,639
um i don't i don't know why i'm not

268
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,839
having any luck suddenly sending this

269
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,839
thing over

270
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,360
let me just do it this way

271
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
all right so that'll bring up a picture

272
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
and

273
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,600
you might want to actually go in and

274
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
copy the link from the picture

275
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
but um

276
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
this lab report is called the phytofax

277
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
and some artifacts were developed by

278
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
napro it's actually it's an image search

279
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,079
i don't know what comes up for you but

280
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
it's the top left picture

281
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,838
on that on that okay one sec i gotta

282
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:36,120
switch off here because it it'll it'll

283
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,120
pause me for a second one sec

284
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
there we go

285
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
you looked really crazy when you were

286
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,319
frozen like you had this really bizarre

287
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
look there we go

288
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,720
i don't know if it'll even let me show

289
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,560
pictures on here now

290
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,839
you might just have to copy and paste

291
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,518
the link in or you know what we'll put

292
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
it up on our ig after some people yeah

293
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
let's put it up on that g after

294
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,480
um

295
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,159
yeah so

296
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
essentially like

297
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,600
look when you get back when most places

298
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,278
give you back a lab report i mean we're

299
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,399
looking at

300
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,838
even even if we're just talking

301
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,799
cannabinoids

302
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,120
you're looking at like

303
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,199
minimum 12 chemicals okay

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,200
because like i guess it's probably

305
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,839
important to talk a little bit about lab

306
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,360
testing there's various ways there's

307
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
different assays that you can do so

308
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
there's different tests that you can run

309
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,839
to try and determine the cannabinoid

310
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,078
content of a sample

311
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
right yeah

312
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,519
if you put it into a gc a gc's got

313
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,278
something it called um

314
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
what is it called the injection port on

315
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,039
a gt it's like putting what you do is

316
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
you take up you take

317
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,759
think about you like you got your bud

318
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,959
you put it in some alcohol or some

319
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,480
methanol or something that's going to

320
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,879
extract to catch me

321
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,839
you more or less shake it up and then

322
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,480
you take like one microliter

323
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,160
of the liquid that has now dissolved so

324
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,560
you got your ethanol but now you've got

325
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,198
all the stuff that came off the plant

326
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,039
yes right in that liquid and so what we

327
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,198
want to do is we take

328
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,278
we take a small sample of that liquid

329
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,439
i'll call it like a thousandth of a

330
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,360
milli milliliter

331
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
and that gets injected into this

332
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,959
injection port

333
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,480
of the of the gas chromatic okay and so

334
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,838
what that does is it takes the liquid

335
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
that we have with all of our stuff

336
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
inside it and it makes it into a vapor

337
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,199
that that injection port is heated like

338
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
300 degrees

339
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,799
yeah they are 350 degrees celsius or

340
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,199
whatever so

341
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,399
the point is is when you put that [ __ ]

342
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,799
in

343
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,440
in the liquid or sorry that liquid into

344
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,000
the injector and it becomes a vapor it

345
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
automatically decarboxylates yeah

346
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,519
right so you don't you no longer have

347
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,879
because the cannabis plant doesn't make

348
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,560
thc it makes thc acid yeah

349
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,198
we really want to be able to detect the

350
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,799
compounds as they were in

351
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,919
the in the plant

352
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,439
right yeah

353
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,919
because what happens is when stuff gets

354
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,120
decarboxylated a certain percentage of

355
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,879
it

356
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
like gets destroyed in the conversion

357
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,120
process it just yeah

358
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,078
right so it's like if you start with

359
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,198
like 100 of thc acid or 100 molecules of

360
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:30,000
thc acid and say you lose 20 of those

361
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,958
molecules as it gets converted into thc

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,039
yeah

363
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,679
when you get a report at the end that

364
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,000
shows 80 milligrams of you know thc or

365
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,919
80 units of thc that's not what was

366
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,799
actually in the sample right our testing

367
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,399
method has destroyed part of the sample

368
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,000
and so if you go back and look at like

369
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,799
all the cannabinoid testing that's been

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,159
done

371
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,679
you know in the scientific literature

372
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,759
60s 70s 80s most of it was done on dc

373
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,758
right so the numbers that we see

374
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,600
are going to be lower than really what

375
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
was in the plant and so

376
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
call it like that's interesting roughly

377
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,758
after 2000 sometime it might have been

378
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,159
like late 90s

379
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,560
people started realizing hey now we need

380
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,399
to do this in what's called an hplc or a

381
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,919
high pressure liquid chromatograph

382
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,440
chromatograph

383
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,278
and okay the liquid chromatograph

384
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,759
doesn't do that initial

385
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,439
decarboxylation step right because your

386
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,399
sample it gets rather going into

387
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,040
ejection in an injection port your micro

388
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,559
microliter of liquid sample that we use

389
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,599
to extract you know our extraction

390
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:32,000
buffer from the plant yeah that gets

391
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,959
injected into like a stream of other

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,919
liquid

393
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,879
that runs through the machine at like 25

394
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,639
27 30 degrees right maybe 40

395
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,799
so that's not a big deal that's not

396
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,919
decarboxylating anything so the

397
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,679
chemicals that are in that

398
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,240
uh in the hplc and the liquid

399
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,159
chromatograph they don't change right so

400
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,639
what we're getting if we use that method

401
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,319
is an accurate representation of what's

402
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,600
in the

403
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,199
uh what's in the sample okay wow okay

404
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,759
and so it's a much better technique for

405
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,678
using for cannabinoids is that what they

406
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,759
use now

407
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
not all labs are the same right so this

408
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,919
is kind of the way here here's the thing

409
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,720
is the last the the regulations usually

410
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,400
say

411
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,120
you have to develop a test that will

412
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,880
accurately quantify cannabinoids yeah

413
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,359
and that test must be

414
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,799
what's called validated and validated

415
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,558
just means like you run a set of

416
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,720
experiments using your

417
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,359
your your protocol to show that your

418
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,038
protocol is

419
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,879
actually measuring what you say it's

420
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,798
measuring yeah right it's like it's like

421
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,200
calibrating your ruler it's like proving

422
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,319
that your ruler is calibrated yeah yeah

423
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,919
right it makes sense like you're not

424
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,279
saying stuff's 12 inches when really

425
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
it's like you know eight and a half

426
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,160
inches or whatever right it's the same

427
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,519
kind of thing yeah that's what

428
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,120
validation is

429
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,119
and so the regulations say you have to

430
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,639
develop a validated method but they

431
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,399
don't tell you you have to use this

432
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
exact method with this machine and this

433
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,720
column and this solvent and this

434
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,798
extraction buffer right and so yeah what

435
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,079
ends up happening is every lab develops

436
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,839
and you'll see if you go and ask them

437
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,639
about their methods a lot of them will

438
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,879
come back and say well that's

439
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
proprietary we can't disclose to you the

440
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
way we do that

441
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,798
right and that's a bit of a red flag

442
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,879
like if i'm yeah

443
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,319
you know like i'm not a one-off

444
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
we do it in-house because it gets too

445
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,159
expensive but you need to do it as a

446
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,160
third party but if i am working with a

447
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
third-party lab we're not just running

448
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,519
one or two tests like we're gonna be

449
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,038
running hundreds of tests right

450
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,440
so we're essentially paying them to

451
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,919
generate data for us right so

452
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,360
i need to be sure

453
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,960
that the test that you guys are running

454
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,879
actually measures what it says so i'll

455
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,120
go in to a lab and say show me all your

456
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
validation document yeah right

457
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,079
they won't let you photocopy them take

458
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
them with you but you can certainly sit

459
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,798
down in their office and read through

460
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,519
their method

461
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,960
right and we've done this

462
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,400
like when i was working at napo we did

463
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,279
this with multiple different labs

464
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,038
because

465
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,839
napo was a research lab and we had

466
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,640
dispensary clients that were

467
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,720
so

468
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,799
you know growers that we represented

469
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,798
would grow the samples we would analyze

470
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,879
the results they'd go off to the lab or

471
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,359
they go off the dispensary but the

472
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,679
dispensary would be using like

473
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,479
one or two or three of the biggest labs

474
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,640
in california for the same samples right

475
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,079
and so we had our data

476
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
that we knew was

477
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,319
damn solid and we published the method

478
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,679
so anybody can go and check out why it's

479
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,599
solid

480
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,000
but it's like we had real confidence in

481
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,839
that our results were right but we would

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,679
what would happen is because our client

483
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,879
would send off the same sample that we

484
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,720
had data for to multiple labs

485
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,640
we would get back

486
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,679
that are essentially duplicate copies of

487
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,160
the same

488
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,320
results yeah but with somebody else's

489
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
lap right so it was generated by

490
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,480
something else and you'd see

491
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,519
oh this lab can identify

492
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,880
terpenoline or this lab is confusing cbd

493
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,279
and cbg

494
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,440
oh wow right and like those are pretty

495
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,558
big deals right yeah that's a big deal

496
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,200
well yeah again like

497
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,038
99.9 of the samples they see are thc

498
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
only so it doesn't really matter whether

499
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,879
that tiny little blip is cbd or cbg but

500
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,639
yeah you know

501
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
again like if we're saying that this is

502
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
a legal document that supports the

503
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,319
regulations that uh that have been

504
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
created to protect cannabis like it's

505
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,918
kind of an important thing yeah yeah you

506
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,360
think so

507
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,919
so yeah

508
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,439
and so in the in the gas chromatography

509
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,320
when they do that kind of sample with

510
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,440
ethanol is that little tiny one

511
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:32,079
milliliter that they or point whatever

512
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,880
milliliters is that homogeneous enough

513
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,319
when they pull it to be a great average

514
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
of the sample that they're taking is

515
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,678
that is it

516
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,279
is that how that works yeah and it's

517
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,679
like that's a very good question so the

518
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,079
sampling of the one microliter

519
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,120
thing like you can you can imagine that

520
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,279
like

521
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,199
every step along that process from

522
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,200
taking the flower it actually goes back

523
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,558
it's like it starts with the sampling

524
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,558
procedure

525
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,240
how did you get the bud out of the bag

526
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,960
that it was grown in or out of the lot

527
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
that it was grown in okay and so

528
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
very often what happens

529
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
is this is

530
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
like

531
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
listen everybody's found all sorts of

532
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,798
ways to game the system because the

533
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,280
consumer is so thc driven yeah

534
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,558
everybody is trying to work every single

535
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,079
snap angle right so for example growers

536
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,158
will go and cherry pick all the biggest

537
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,759
nicest beautiful buds out of the thing

538
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,120
the biggest bugs are the top of the

539
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,200
plant they get of course they're going

540
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,918
to have chemical content

541
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,279
right and so if you want a real number

542
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,679
of the batch

543
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,599
we developed a sampling method where you

544
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,519
know you take one bud this big and one

545
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,279
bud this big and then one bud this big

546
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,519
and they all get combined together or

547
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,519
you know so many grams of each the whole

548
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,519
thing gets blended up

549
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,960
and and homogenized and then you use

550
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,798
that homogenized sample to do your

551
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,919
extraction from right

552
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,519
people don't do it like if you're

553
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,799
showing up at fc labs and you're trying

554
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,038
to like get a feed company you're trying

555
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,798
to sell a million seeds

556
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,879
they go and they chop off the top is

557
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,639
nice big buds and they trim all the like

558
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
the grainy leafy parts off so there's

559
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,640
like absolutely nothing but resin yeah

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,400
and then those pristine beautiful baby

561
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,440
labs go off the samples go off to the

562
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,559
left yeah you're gonna get a [ __ ]

563
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,798
higher number

564
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,319
right that's that should be obvious but

565
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,679
these are the games that end up getting

566
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,000
played because

567
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,360
the more thc you got in your sample the

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
better the distributors and the

569
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,639
retailers and everybody is you know

570
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
anybody that's thc focus they're gonna

571
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,679
get

572
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,439
bamboozled from that kind of stuff right

573
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,280
yeah and so like you said there's

574
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,840
there's that's just sampling the flower

575
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,678
now it goes to the lab like maybe the

576
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,759
labs like getting paid a decent fee and

577
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
they like put like an extra you know

578
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,158
point five or five percent extra flour

579
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,319
in the scale when they go to do the

580
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,120
extraction buffer like there's there's a

581
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,119
million ways between

582
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,199
the plants and getting

583
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,439
you know that injection going into the

584
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,319
injection port ways to manipulate the

585
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,360
sample yeah forget like intentionally

586
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:58,079
manipulating it there's also like

587
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,158
natural variation and like experimental

588
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,759
error that happens yeah that is going to

589
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
allow that is going to have on a loud

590
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,038
variation and so one thing we were

591
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,559
talking about the other day is that like

592
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,558
for example in canada

593
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:12,798
the regulation says

594
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:14,399
that the thc content in the flower

595
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,038
um

596
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,798
must be whatever's labeled on the on the

597
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,359
bag or the box however it's labeled for

598
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,519
thc content yeah that has to be within

599
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,918
plus or minus 15 percent

600
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,200
of the actual amount well so that's like

601
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,000
if it's 20 and it's actual 20

602
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,480
15 20 is three so that means

603
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,240
that like 23 to 17 or 17 to 23 is

604
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,159
actually like that plus or minus 15

605
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,120
percent window on either side of 20

606
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
right

607
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,158
so

608
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,359
like it's important for people to

609
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,360
understand that like

610
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:53,679
with a loud error that's to be expected

611
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,240
there's really no difference between 17

612
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
and 23

613
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,240
and then and again that would apply like

614
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,558
between 30 and 24 right like

615
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,079
well yeah as you go up like yeah up to

616
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,240
30 now

617
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,960
you know about 50 of 30 is four and a

618
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,919
half percent right so you've got like 34

619
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,880
percent down to like what is it 26 five

620
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,960
and a half right 25.5 yeah yeah so like

621
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,440
that's a huge [ __ ] rate yeah as you

622
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
get higher it gets quieter

623
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
yeah

624
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,400
and listen

625
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,240
that is cannabinoids cannabinoids are

626
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
typically regulated by regulation like

627
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,919
the regulator whoever makes the rules

628
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,400
for the you know to set up a legal

629
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,440
program says hey can havenoid lab test

630
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,360
have to be

631
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,278
with plus or minus within plus or minus

632
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,439
15 that's what that's going to be our

633
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,599
allowed range so your

634
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,000
your assay that or that protocol that

635
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,599
your lab designs to generate this thing

636
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,599
it has to hit between these two goat

637
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,558
balls well terpenes like for example

638
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,678
terps aren't regulated in canada

639
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,839
right so they're

640
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,600
considered cannabinoids

641
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,480
no they're not catalyzed okay

642
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,480
yeah

643
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,839
their cannabinoids are a specific class

644
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
that bind to the cannabinoid receptor

645
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,399
and it's arguably like only

646
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,759
beta-carotene binds to one of them

647
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,278
so

648
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,519
but they're they're a different chemical

649
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,119
class but like you know all of us all

650
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,960
the producers

651
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,038
and retailers they want that terpene

652
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,840
info on the label right because it is

653
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,720
somewhat informative to the consumer so

654
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,759
it's another way that you can

655
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,200
differentiate your product say hey

656
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,480
mine's different because this is the

657
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,278
chemical well

658
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,759
yeah terpenoids or terpenes aren't

659
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,159
regulated in the system like there is no

660
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,919
requirement to analyze and disclose the

661
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,640
amount of terpene content on a flower

662
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
it's like it's purely an extra thing

663
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
yeah

664
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,439
so because they're not regulated

665
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,959
molecules there's no [ __ ] regulations

666
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
that says

667
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,000
hey it has to be within

668
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,679
15 allowable range

669
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,440
so in canada

670
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,798
and i'm sure it's i don't know exactly

671
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,440
what it is it probably varies by

672
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,278
district in the state but at least

673
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,759
because they're not

674
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,679
regulated labs set their own allowable

675
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,640
acceptable rate so

676
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,640
i validated one labs method

677
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,038
and i was reading through their

678
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,278
described allowable range is 30 plus or

679
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,319
minus jesus

680
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,519
so

681
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,918
you've got like let's call it like

682
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,440
well let's call it six percent terps

683
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,480
yeah right

684
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,278
a third is like two out of those six so

685
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,558
that's essentially saying like

686
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,079
you know two percent on either side of

687
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,038
six that's like from four to eight

688
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,639
percent range yeah that the lab can't

689
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,960
really differentiate between the

690
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,799
difference between those two things

691
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,278
right yeah

692
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,639
um like that's a bomb that's a huge

693
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,960
bummer i don't think people understand

694
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,520
that because you know when some of these

695
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,400
labs publish the results they're like oh

696
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,519
you have like three point four seven

697
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
nine

698
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,480
uh milligrams of are

699
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,599
3.579

700
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
um

701
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,480
percent mircine yeah right well it's

702
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,600
like dude if it's 30

703
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,278
off

704
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,359
why the hell are we measuring it down to

705
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,599
three decimals yeah that's true that's

706
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,839
wild yeah it's it's intense

707
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,119
right it's like you just it's so dumb

708
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,639
but again

709
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,879
you have to realize there's a difference

710
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,120
between accurately leaving labeling the

711
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,000
information on a product

712
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:22,158
versus how can you stick information on

713
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,960
a label of a product to sway a

714
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,760
consumer's buying preference right

715
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,840
um

716
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,640
and clearly those aren't the same thing

717
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,639
no right so not at all it's kind of i

718
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,360
think it's really

719
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,120
well

720
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,038
for anybody watching like if you're just

721
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,158
basing things on thc numbers you're

722
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,519
getting fooled like you're getting

723
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,559
bamboozled right yeah um

724
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,558
you're getting you're having your

725
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,440
marketing emotions played with right and

726
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,119
this is this is what companies do

727
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,640
um

728
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,239
so understanding that all in context

729
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,080
maybe let's think about going back and

730
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,759
looking at like a lab report right and

731
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,519
so

732
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,038
in the numbers that you sent me one of

733
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,879
the things i found really interesting

734
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,798
was you know whenever i look at a lab

735
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,720
report my first thing is

736
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639
i don't even like everybody goes to

737
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,798
straight to tac or straight to terpene

738
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
content or whatever i don't know i go

739
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,240
who who's the lab

740
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,159
yeah right who's the lab are these guys

741
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,159
trustworthy or not and after like a

742
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,679
thousand lab reports or 2000 lab reports

743
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,080
you start to say

744
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,159
hey these guys always have like you know

745
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:28,319
like all of their roosevelts are like 33

746
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,120
to 38 thc like yeah

747
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,278
really yeah i apply that same logic

748
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,119
right things or to seed companies you

749
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,640
know like i see them working with things

750
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,398
like 40 different things that have been

751
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,120
non-existent for 40 years and i'm like

752
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,639
okay well full of [ __ ] you know yeah

753
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,839
yeah yeah and it's marketing right and

754
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,919
the thing is too like the other thing

755
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,079
you got to keep in mind too it's like

756
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,919
when we see these hchc scores like 30

757
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,240
plus percent thc acid

758
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,080
that's a huge amount yeah it really is

759
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,038
like a [ __ ] massive amount for a

760
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,000
plant to produce that was one flower on

761
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,200
one run right that's really what was set

762
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,759
sampled

763
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,519
if you follow that cultivar

764
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,759
back through five ten cycles like you'll

765
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,240
see twenty eight twenty six

766
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,519
sure but the one that always appears on

767
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,558
the seed bank

768
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,918
package says it's 34 oh yeah yeah right

769
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,079
so like

770
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,840
people got to realize that like when

771
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,480
you're being fed one of these numbers

772
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:26,319
especially if it doesn't come on

773
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,679
that certified letterhead legal document

774
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,439
and they're fine at the bottom like if

775
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,120
you go down and look at it it's signed

776
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,759
by the laboratory manager right because

777
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,759
again that's part of this

778
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,158
chain of custody thing that happens with

779
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,200
regulated ship right yeah

780
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,640
so

781
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,120
um yeah so check out the lab okay yeah

782
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,038
secondly

783
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,278
look before even looking at the numbers

784
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,398
like i i was like you know i always want

785
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,240
to say

786
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,719
before i can put any confidence in these

787
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,798
numbers i need to try and figure out how

788
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,960
those numbers were generated yes right

789
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:02,720
and so a lab report should say

790
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,480
cannabinoids were were analyzed by hplc

791
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,558
so they had a laboratory back and it

792
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,440
says cannabinoids are analyzed by gc

793
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,038
it's like right there i'm like okay well

794
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,240
the cannabinoid numbers could be off by

795
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,398
30

796
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,960
yeah right because we've done those

797
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,278
experiments and you can burn up to 30 or

798
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,440
30 of the total cannabinoid content in

799
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,440
an injection port of a gc

800
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,278
inject like gcs are not a great

801
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,679
instrument for measuring cannabinoids

802
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,839
even though all the analysis like up to

803
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,200
the mid 90s was done that way

804
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,798
right yeah

805
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,798
but for terpenes for example it's

806
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,798
actually a great way to do it

807
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,558
and so

808
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,639
a lot of very good labs what they'll do

809
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,639
is they'll do it you'll do your you know

810
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,720
you put your bud grind it up

811
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,240
homogenize it take your sample put in

812
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,079
your ethanol or methanol or whatever

813
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,558
your extraction buffer is

814
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,319
strip out the contents separate out the

815
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,440
solid material now you've got your

816
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,200
little liquid

817
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,200
yeah with all your goodies in it right

818
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,359
that often gets split into two different

819
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,840
samples or you will sample two different

820
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:07,278
one microliter amounts from there one

821
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:10,720
goes gets injected into an hplc

822
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:13,919
for cannabinoid a separate one goes into

823
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,839
uh an hpls or sorry a gc4 terpenoid or

824
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,360
terpene okay okay

825
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,759
we actually used to do two different

826
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,719
things when we sent the one off to

827
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,038
uh

828
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,399
the the hplc we would take

829
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,480
your sample out

830
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,639
and then we would take one raw sample

831
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,200
out of that subsample and the other

832
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,519
would get diluted by a factor of 10.

833
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
so you have nine parts nine microliters

834
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,000
of of the solvent mixed in so now what

835
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,798
you do is you have

836
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,839
um a diluted sample and a concentrated

837
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,319
sample

838
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,759
and so the concentrated sample is good

839
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,278
for

840
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,599
all the very small

841
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:53,679
components that exist like you know cbc

842
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,439
the cbg

843
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,960
whatever the little blip cannabinoids

844
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,000
are essentially you've got one that's

845
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
like really

846
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,839
it's like being able to do that on those

847
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,839
with a magnifying glass yeah

848
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,678
your diluted sample for the molecules

849
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,519
that are there in abundance

850
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,000
right because if you try to often if you

851
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,240
try to cram those like thc like a type

852
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,919
one plant that's full of thc you cram

853
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,480
that through your hplc and it just it

854
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,559
overloads the detector okay so you

855
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
wanted to so

856
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,319
as you can see all these places are

857
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,278
opportunity for error

858
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:29,119
yeah if you do them very very carefully

859
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,960
you can actually get incredibly um

860
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,439
incredibly accurate results now if

861
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,679
you're like running

862
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,798
a thousand two thousand samples a week

863
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,798
that come into your commercial

864
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,798
laboratory in california

865
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,240
dude that's like three throughput

866
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:43,679
yeah right so it's like you're you're

867
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,798
essentially breaking down how many can i

868
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,240
do in a day

869
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,158
okay well if i'm doing that many a day

870
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
maybe i don't have the ability to do it

871
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,480
quite as accurately yeah right and so

872
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,000
these are the decisions that get made in

873
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,200
the lab that no one's thinking about

874
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,038
everybody just thinks you drop down your

875
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,640
120 bucks or 150 bucks and you get a

876
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,079
bunch of numbers back in it's proof of

877
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,440
them yeah you just toss it in the

878
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,359
machine bam

879
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
yeah it's not like that right

880
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,599
so

881
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,000
it's just important for people to

882
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,678
understand the context right so

883
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,359
do um did you want to go over the

884
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,480
standard what the standard is how it

885
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,639
works

886
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,120
yeah so chemicals so any machine has to

887
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,640
be calibrated right

888
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,959
um

889
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,960
and

890
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,519
how's the best way to explain it when we

891
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,798
take you so you got your butt okay you

892
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,960
get your butt call us our extraction

893
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,720
buffer you put a flower in there you put

894
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,558
in your ethanol and shake it around blah

895
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,399
blah blah

896
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,158
send out the flower oops say about the

897
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,918
flower i just throw a sample all over

898
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,200
the ground

899
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,000
you said about the flower and you got

900
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,480
your

901
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,640
your your left over what we've got is

902
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,240
ethanol or methanol whatever it doesn't

903
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,919
matter your solvent

904
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,679
with all the chemicals that we were able

905
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,360
to strip out of the cannabis plant

906
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,960
material so you got turf you've got all

907
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,278
the different cannabinoids

908
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,960
a standard like but we don't know how

909
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,960
much of everything is in that

910
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,079
sample like it's an unknown amount of

911
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,759
unknown chemicals in the sample right

912
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,359
and what we need to do is compare it to

913
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,480
a known sample

914
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,440
and so

915
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,838
you can actually order pure thc from a

916
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,519
lab synthesis company and these

917
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,759
synthesis companies that are allowed to

918
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,358
have you know they get a dea license so

919
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,720
that like the cops can have and they'll

920
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,239
they'll sell

921
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
they'll be the dea license so they can

922
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,638
synthesize thc and make

923
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,398
what are what are known as like a

924
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,559
chemical standard which is usually one

925
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,679
milligram of thc

926
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:36,000
into one milliliter of methanol yeah

927
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,320
well methanol is an alcohol but it's not

928
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,398
like ethanol it's poisonous go blind so

929
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,838
the idea is people won't consume it

930
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,440
so it's

931
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,398
so weird that anybody would like

932
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,320
consider the idea to go get thc standard

933
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,838
ethanol like [ __ ] shoot it or

934
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,000
whatever they're doing and do with it

935
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,159
it's wild yeah but this is what the dea

936
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,800
is the the context of the da's thinking

937
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,240
in progress right like yeah of course

938
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
thc and someone's gonna try and get high

939
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,838
a milligram like dude really yeah you

940
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,000
know like even like a 20 bud is like 200

941
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,920
milligrams yeah right so it's like you

942
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,519
really you're gonna try to anyway

943
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,039
of course you don't but that's the

944
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,719
theory behind it but

945
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,679
one milligram

946
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,759
in one milliliter of ethanol is legal

947
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,838
yeah it's legal people can buy and trade

948
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,079
it without having licenses

949
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:22,078
so

950
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,960
now you have your one milligram

951
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,719
milliliter you can essentially treat

952
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,559
that like your extraction buffer

953
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,719
extracted cannabis plant you can take

954
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,440
like one microliter out of that

955
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:38,078
milliliter inject it into your hplc and

956
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,119
you get a peak of a known amount and you

957
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,720
can say okay this peak is i know that

958
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,800
it's this known amount we're putting in

959
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:48,239
boom

960
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,079
you know now i can when i run

961
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,000
another sample and it has a peak of the

962
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,320
same size i know that it had the

963
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,838
equivalent amount of thc so it's a way

964
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,880
that you can calibrate your machines

965
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,320
okay got it and good labs will do what

966
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,760
are called check standards like you run

967
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,000
your calibration curve you get the

968
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,000
machine all calibrated and then like

969
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,199
call it every three or five or maybe 10

970
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,960
runs

971
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,358
rather than running a sample you run

972
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,440
your standard through or your standard

973
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,759
mix of terpene standards and cannabinoid

974
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,119
standards and what that should do is

975
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
that like

976
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,920
now you have throughout your day you've

977
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,000
got your 100 samples that are going

978
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,920
through the lab say every 10

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,719
you've got like a snapshot of the

980
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,119
machine in calibration yeah

981
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,319
and if it's out you can see oh hey we

982
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,280
caught it while it was getting out of

983
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,440
calibration let's recalibrate it right

984
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
that makes sense it's an important it's

985
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,800
for any analytical

986
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,800
uh endeavor where you're trying to

987
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,039
figure out like hey what's this exact

988
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,039
amount of compound in a plant or in a

989
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,119
substance you want to have the ability

990
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,960
to compound or to

991
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,320
to validate that number confirm that the

992
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,159
amount that you're measuring is actually

993
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
what you're measuring right

994
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,239
yeah um

995
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,400
so it's a great question because like

996
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,239
when our my friend arnold has

997
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,559
a dutch research scientist that was

998
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,719
involved in setting up the dutch system

999
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,320
and he's a real plant nerd guy and he

1000
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,239
started doing all this research and he

1001
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,920
wanted to to check to see if the

1002
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,439
standards from the chemical company are

1003
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,559
or are what they were you know they're

1004
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,400
supposed to be

1005
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,000
one milligram per milliliter well he did

1006
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,960
a whole bunch of tests and showed that

1007
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,358
the standard was actually 88 or 0.88

1008
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,159
milligrams oh yeah

1009
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:27,519
so the the the substance that the guys

1010
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,960
are selling to all the labs

1011
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,480
wasn't properly calibrated that means

1012
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
everybody in the industry is off right

1013
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,280
or everybody yeah that's from those guys

1014
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,519
wrong

1015
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,040
like this is we're talking you know

1016
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,800
i think it was like 20 2009

1017
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,159
but two years ago in canada the same

1018
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,560
thing happened right like somebody

1019
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,559
identified that hey you know the restek

1020
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,639
sample or that was restek is a supplier

1021
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,559
for standards the res tech samples that

1022
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,799
everybody uses to calibrate or but half

1023
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,279
the industry uses calibrate they've been

1024
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,039
wrong for eight months man they kept

1025
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,040
that quiet

1026
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,279
it comes up in the circles but it

1027
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,159
doesn't like yeah it does come up if you

1028
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,839
if you're

1029
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,920
it listen when that happens they have to

1030
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,000
like they're legally to send that

1031
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,159
requirement but again you're the support

1032
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
industry for a regulated system

1033
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,519
yeah you [ __ ] up that's affecting

1034
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,400
everybody how they're complying with the

1035
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,400
regulations it's like they are closed

1036
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,920
right so it does it does become known to

1037
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,440
much lab but again it's the type of

1038
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
thing that like

1039
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,400
the labs might

1040
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,439
they're not required to disclose to the

1041
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,119
public

1042
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,800
yeah yeah right they they probably

1043
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,838
should disclose to their clients but

1044
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,359
often they don't right yeah

1045
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,199
um or it can happen that they don't so

1046
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,719
anyway like

1047
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,319
yeah that's a chemical standard and you

1048
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,838
buy a chemical essentially if you're

1049
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,320
calibrating for cannabinoids like you

1050
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,679
know i was just on the sc lab website

1051
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,079
reading over through some of their stuff

1052
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,559
they they test for 39 terpenes and

1053
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,359
terpenoids so they've even

1054
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:54,480
they they either have a standard mix

1055
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,480
that a chemical supplier supplies or

1056
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,719
they buy individually all of those

1057
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
individual terpenes and

1058
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,879
create their own standard mix that they

1059
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,800
use to to calibrate the machine so

1060
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,079
you're not only calibrating for thc

1061
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,440
you're calibrating for terps if you're

1062
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,480
running the test you're currently every

1063
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,000
individual terpene yeah wow

1064
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,280
yeah and like i said some now they've

1065
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,119
gotten to the point where

1066
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,480
like uh you know

1067
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,480
say

1068
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,079
res tech or someone one of these terpe

1069
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,159
or these supply chemical supply

1070
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,599
companies that services the medical

1071
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,679
cannabis industry

1072
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,640
they might say hey we've done the mix

1073
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,358
for you here's 15 terpenes you know all

1074
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,000
the majors or whatever yeah the pioneers

1075
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,679
termine blah blah blah and you'll buy a

1076
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,039
pre-mixed

1077
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,879
one of those so that you don't have to

1078
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,039
individually go and create the standard

1079
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,599
to put it to calibrate your dc

1080
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,519
yeah um but again anytime you're buying

1081
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,200
a compound that you're not making and

1082
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,199
you're not quantifying your say itself

1083
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,960
is a potential source of error

1084
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,480
yeah absolutely

1085
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,400
so

1086
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,400
yeah it's a bit of a deal

1087
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,160
so wow so when we started looking at

1088
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,160
your results i started going through

1089
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,920
them i realized

1090
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,358
whoever was generating those results for

1091
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,000
one

1092
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,000
like again it was data pasted into uh an

1093
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,639
excel spreadsheet yeah it wasn't even a

1094
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,400
lab report so it's like one like right

1095
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,239
off the bat it's like how much i'm not

1096
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,480
saying it was the numbers were wrong but

1097
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,598
if somebody gave it no yeah my red flags

1098
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,920
would be like okay

1099
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,960
something could be up here yeah the

1100
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,838
second thing i went through and i

1101
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,079
started looking at what's the ratio of

1102
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:28,159
thc um in the plant versus thc acid in

1103
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,920
the plant as you probably know cannabis

1104
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,159
doesn't produce thc it produces the

1105
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,599
natural form thc acid

1106
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,039
and so

1107
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,400
if right right

1108
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,079
right away if you get a live report back

1109
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,160
and there's junk thc in there like i'm

1110
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,359
talking more than really a percent

1111
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,159
yeah

1112
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,519
it's probably been run through a gc

1113
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,440
so it's like okay

1114
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,880
if the thc numbers are coming out like

1115
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,679
you know 20 thc 25 whatever that's yeah

1116
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,039
you should see 25 percent thc acid

1117
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,000
yeah you couldn't see 25 thc so

1118
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,800
right here

1119
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,880
like just by that one number you can see

1120
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,960
oh they measure the whether or not they

1121
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,200
measure the cannabinoids through plc or

1122
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,599
through gc if it's through gc the number

1123
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,358
is probably wrong yeah because again we

1124
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,519
know that a bunch of it gets destroyed

1125
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,440
in the injector right so

1126
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,920
there's things that you can like right

1127
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,679
off the top look at you know most people

1128
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,358
are looking at the they grab the lab

1129
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,159
report they go straight to the thc

1130
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:26,078
number and they're like 32 i'm the best

1131
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,920
yeah right and it's like that's you

1132
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,760
shouldn't be doing that right yeah

1133
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
looking at the context of what that

1134
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,599
number means

1135
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,200
is all the information in this lab

1136
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,960
report consistent

1137
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,960
right and internally consistent like

1138
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,559
this between each other

1139
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,079
yeah like the queen itself doesn't make

1140
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,000
sense and so that was one of the things

1141
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,720
that's that tweaked me a little bit when

1142
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,440
i first saw yours it was like

1143
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,879
they had clearly run in hplc

1144
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,480
and gc

1145
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,079
which is fine i mean like i said if

1146
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,920
you're using it for the terps the gc is

1147
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,800
fine but they were probably it looked

1148
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,720
like they were collecting that

1149
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,318
cannabinoid data as they were doing the

1150
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,039
terpene run as well

1151
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,358
ah okay so it's like you know in my mind

1152
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,960
i'm like looking at him like ignore that

1153
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,559
yeah don't even look at that don't even

1154
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,679
put any credence into it because it's

1155
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,838
just

1156
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,519
it's weird well and

1157
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,519
with me like when i see something off

1158
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,519
like that and like when it comes to

1159
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,280
terps and lab reports the reason i sent

1160
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,358
it to you of course when we talked i was

1161
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,359
like i don't know like i have no fun

1162
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,639
including you can read this what is it

1163
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,078
but like

1164
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,639
yeah i i

1165
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,800
i i'm like anybody else you know like i

1166
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,639
i see that and i'm like wow thc number

1167
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,318
wow cool high terp numbers what's this

1168
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,078
somebody asked me about a year ago ryan

1169
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,920
when you start getting

1170
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,680
uh skeptical about a lab report and i

1171
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,000
said when somebody says to me i have a

1172
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,759
lab report for you to see

1173
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,920
right you should already be skeptical of

1174
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,040
the results and that's okay like it's

1175
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,920
not like you're trying to hate on

1176
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:52,719
somebody's report card no but you should

1177
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,400
be yeah you have to be right like you

1178
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,919
that is the mentality that you have to

1179
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,800
have are these numbers that i'm looking

1180
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,800
at really real yeah right

1181
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,200
yes

1182
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,160
because like again like you know you

1183
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,919
hear i hear for a while in washington

1184
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,598
they were calling them thc stores it's

1185
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,639
not a [ __ ] score

1186
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,400
like you didn't win a race

1187
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,480
this is an analysis of what's in the

1188
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,480
flower that you grew yeah

1189
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,199
and like yeah you played a role in that

1190
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,760
but it's mostly genetics right like

1191
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,439
you know anyway it's just funny like you

1192
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,920
you know in this world that we're in

1193
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,280
like there's so much grower's ego right

1194
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,280
where it's like oh yeah you know and

1195
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,519
it's like i really like let's try to

1196
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,160
tease those two things apart

1197
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,920
right with how awesome you are from the

1198
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,279
weed that you grew i'm like all for

1199
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,280
telling people that they grow great meat

1200
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,280
you go great flower i mean i'm always

1201
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,480
impressed i don't care who it is yeah

1202
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,480
right it's like if you're truly

1203
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,920
producing the finest that's great like

1204
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,199
people like that in my opinion helping

1205
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,519
the world

1206
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,199
right but if you're just growing

1207
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,239
like looking for lab of course you can

1208
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,919
run around the world telling how

1209
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,759
everybody how cool you are it's like you

1210
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
know yeah it doesn't impress me like

1211
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,359
i've seen enough live boards that like i

1212
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,119
don't it's like who cares great you got

1213
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,960
it yeah you got a big one it's like

1214
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,880
great you know what i mean like yeah we

1215
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,440
if you grow enough plants especially

1216
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,240
from seed you're going to find some big

1217
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,039
ones yeah right big big big plants and

1218
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,719
big big high numbers so

1219
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,719
anyway that's like a good thing to look

1220
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,639
at look at the cannabinoids are you know

1221
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,919
are you seeing neutral cannabinoids or

1222
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,598
acidic cannabinoids or bones right

1223
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,079
you want to be seen both

1224
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,160
and you want your neutrals like thc cbd

1225
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,160
cbg you want those numbers to be really

1226
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:35,920
low yeah um because that's an indicator

1227
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,759
that your lab report is good and now you

1228
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,200
sent me like for example so you sent me

1229
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
ones and one had like i think there was

1230
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,039
like three and a three and a four

1231
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,639
percent or terp-wise yes they're both

1232
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,000
like i mean those are

1233
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,519
we have a we had what we called the

1234
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,199
schwag flag

1235
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,480
and it's really like under one percent

1236
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,480
so we would just discard anything that

1237
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,559
was under one percent terpene content

1238
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,920
yeah because they're they're not like

1239
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,799
they're 80s weed it's not that they're

1240
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,000
bad

1241
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,680
yeah it's just not the oiliest dankest

1242
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,800
like super drippy oily wheat right

1243
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:08,559
um

1244
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,160
and so we would just automatically

1245
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,759
anything under it doesn't even get

1246
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,719
considered for the

1247
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,720
for you know quality and then

1248
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,480
we started you know this is a few years

1249
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,959
ago but we were you know getting into

1250
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,358
the four or five percent range

1251
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,039
and through breeding the highest

1252
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,119
terpenoid producing plants we were able

1253
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:30,079
to get some like outliers that were up

1254
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,640
to like even seven percent or even eight

1255
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,400
which is like ridiculously oily yeah

1256
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,440
um

1257
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,119
so you know you can do that but

1258
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,880
again like you really want to have

1259
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,119
confidence in the lab that you're doing

1260
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
exactly and

1261
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,519
as a

1262
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,119
as a breeder like a home breeder it gets

1263
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,358
really [ __ ] expensive to use thirty

1264
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,000
party third-party laps because it does

1265
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,920
you're growing a hundred plants

1266
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,559
like that's like a ten thousand dollar

1267
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,240
analytical bill yeah yeah crazy in most

1268
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,000
cases like even if you were to turn

1269
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,159
around and sell every gram of that crop

1270
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,199
you're not getting enough like yeah

1271
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,118
you know unless you're growing huge

1272
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,519
plants you're not getting that 10 grand

1273
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,318
back yeah right so

1274
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,159
um

1275
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,440
doing that kind of breeding has to be

1276
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,559
funded by people with pockets or

1277
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,838
somebody that has an understanding that

1278
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:19,838
hey i'm going to make an investment in

1279
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,759
this and the result that comes out of

1280
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,400
the end is going to have value

1281
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,839
yeah right and and so nowadays like

1282
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,920
you'll see those plants that are like up

1283
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:29,358
into the five percent like five percent

1284
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,519
i'm not gonna say it's a maxima in the

1285
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,039
market but like yeah when i see someone

1286
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,880
with a five percenter

1287
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,880
even when i consider it might be thirty

1288
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,838
percent inflated i'm like my good job

1289
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,200
you agree that well yeah um

1290
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,279
when i see eights i'm really skeptical

1291
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,199
again they're not possible i know

1292
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,480
they're possible because we've made them

1293
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,719
yeah but

1294
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,318
when it's such an anomaly got like six

1295
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,199
lines and all of them are eight

1296
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,358
percenters yeah that's kind of like oh

1297
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,358
yeah you won like five billion dollar

1298
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:02,000
lotteries in a row like the probability

1299
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:04,000
of that is really [ __ ] low right and

1300
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,679
so when the probability is really low

1301
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,318
something shifty is probably going on

1302
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,838
right yeah right like this isn't about

1303
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:12,639
calling anybody out or saying whatever

1304
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:15,599
your [ __ ] stuff sugar yeah yeah like you

1305
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,559
know somebody showed me a 38

1306
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,480
labs flower 38

1307
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,358
total cannabinoids

1308
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,639
um which is like exceptionally high and

1309
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,119
it was enough to be lab important i

1310
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,838
called up josh you know i know josh and

1311
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,440
uh

1312
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,880
and alec from there they're two of the

1313
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,079
owners and i called up alec and i said

1314
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,760
dude like

1315
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,680
what's up with this number like people

1316
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,640
are showing this all over ig and sending

1317
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,239
it to me

1318
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,078
tell me what's going on with this sample

1319
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,719
and he's like yeah he says when we get a

1320
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,559
number over you know i think it was 32

1321
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,919
or whatever

1322
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,760
but when they when they have a number

1323
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,440
that hits a certain thing it's go back

1324
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,440
to the sample

1325
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,039
start from the beginning again and yeah

1326
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,720
the whole process reanalyze it they call

1327
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,920
it a represent run a reprep on that

1328
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:59,519
sample

1329
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,200
and they do and it came back like you

1330
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,719
know within the same

1331
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,480
small window that it was like yeah it's

1332
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:08,399
a real number wow so you can have like

1333
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,358
these massive [ __ ] numbers where it's

1334
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,358
like

1335
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:12,799
all the stars aligned and the plants

1336
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,960
treated perfectly and it's the most

1337
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,559
banging genetic and

1338
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,318
the the dry and everything is done

1339
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,079
perfectly and you preserve that

1340
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,960
beautiful specimen and get it yeah

1341
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,720
um

1342
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,079
so when you when you show me your

1343
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,439
samples and you have that one that was

1344
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,760
higher yeah and all i can tell you is

1345
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,119
it seems high it doesn't mean it's wrong

1346
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,200
yeah but

1347
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,200
it's one to look at

1348
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,118
it's anomalous

1349
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,199
yeah exactly and there's two anomalies

1350
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,079
in those three samples

1351
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,719
well yeah so so so even if it was just

1352
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,480
based on the numbers i would be like

1353
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:49,679
that doesn't mean that they're wrong

1354
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,920
yeah

1355
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,078
no lab report no signature

1356
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,000
it's not even on a lab report you know

1357
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,680
yeah no i don't know the lab never saw

1358
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,440
it missing it's like all those things

1359
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,039
combined it's like red flag red flag red

1360
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,400
flag rag flag

1361
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:07,838
right so absolutely yeah

1362
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,838
and like i said you know

1363
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,199
the only way to really know these things

1364
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:12,880
is to run that sample that that plant

1365
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,519
through five different grows and analyze

1366
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,960
that that yeah and kind of see what's

1367
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,318
the range of what that plant does

1368
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,679
um

1369
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:22,800
yeah i mean i guess it could be an

1370
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,719
anomalous

1371
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,760
it could be an anomalous anomalously

1372
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,879
good grow just that one round and

1373
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,359
that's that

1374
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,358
only time you'll ever see it yeah and i

1375
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:34,960
think like i think that we can still say

1376
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,239
that like

1377
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,199
nobody

1378
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,118
really knows all the secret little

1379
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,598
switches and bells and whistles which is

1380
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,400
to give a plant to make it produce

1381
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,559
at its optimum optimum production every

1382
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,318
single time like sure you know you hit

1383
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,680
it or you don't and sometimes like

1384
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,119
there's a lot of clouds or sometimes

1385
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,440
it's shitty weather and you get you know

1386
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,720
like whatever it is like yeah

1387
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,559
nothing goes perfectly the air

1388
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,000
conditioner goes down who knows right

1389
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,200
yeah there's a ton of things that can go

1390
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,440
wrong

1391
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,799
um

1392
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,800
so

1393
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,280
again in the context of like the thing i

1394
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,880
like consumers to know is that like it's

1395
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,640
just to understand that context just

1396
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,838
because it's like you know like i'm out

1397
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:15,118
in the market you're out in the market

1398
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,039
we're trying to sell seeds we're trying

1399
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,599
to provide good products from people and

1400
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,519
you've got some jump that's been growing

1401
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,599
for like seven years

1402
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,838
and they've got an instagram page with

1403
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,318
like their crosses and like

1404
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:31,599
everything's you know i i you know my

1405
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:33,759
results range from like 32 to 40 thc and

1406
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,280
it's just yeah

1407
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,160
the reason i want to have these

1408
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,480
conversations in public is so that like

1409
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,879
the consumers that are watching us they

1410
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,559
can become informed and then when they

1411
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,200
see the used car sales and seed pushers

1412
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,680
that like are everywhere in this [ __ ]

1413
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,279
market every left turn like every second

1414
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,759
account that follows me is something

1415
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,440
genetics or something labs yeah right

1416
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,119
it's like oh you're a lab are you you've

1417
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,838
got like a tent

1418
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,280
yeah

1419
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,960
um

1420
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,559
it's all about

1421
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,800
it's it's all about marketing it's all

1422
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,720
about trying to [ __ ] nick buck right

1423
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,640
yeah and

1424
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,558
you know i'd like making a living out of

1425
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,078
a cannabis would be nice for everybody

1426
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,640
but

1427
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,519
you know i really

1428
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,598
have

1429
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,719
taken this to like a stupid level of

1430
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,720
passion

1431
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,558
yeah in depthness that it's like when i

1432
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,239
have to stand beside like joe blow

1433
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,160
that's like

1434
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,439
it's about nonsense it's like i just you

1435
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,199
know and i'm

1436
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,639
not competing not even competing for an

1437
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,159
audience but it's like i'm at a

1438
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,598
conference i'm speaking on a panel

1439
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,440
besides some dude

1440
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,359
that's like spouting nonsense near this

1441
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,200
point jesus christ man

1442
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,558
yeah it's hard it's hard when you love

1443
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,279
something that much and you fit that

1444
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,960
many that many years into it and and

1445
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,040
just to watch you get bastardized super

1446
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,920
fast around you well yeah

1447
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:55,358
and the only way to do that is to like

1448
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,318
you know is to try to explain to people

1449
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:00,558
why your shit's different right

1450
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,920
like what do you see like all this time

1451
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,519
and energy that i put into learning and

1452
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,240
understanding all this stuff like why it

1453
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,079
makes a difference in our our seeds

1454
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,239
yeah

1455
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,720
and

1456
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,039
you know it's it's demoralizing

1457
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,279
that it's demoralizing to have to

1458
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,679
to sit there and do that and the but the

1459
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,079
only way to really have people recognize

1460
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,919
is to like educate all of our consumers

1461
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,839
right yeah so that people can be

1462
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,680
informed and people can like not get

1463
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,519
caught in the carnival

1464
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,639
of co get caught up with the carnival

1465
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,039
parkers

1466
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,480
yeah right so

1467
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,239
yeah it's abundant

1468
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,838
well they're everywhere it's like you

1469
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,439
know it's like trying to walk across a

1470
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,440
field like avoiding cow patties

1471
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:44,719
yeah it really is

1472
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,559
there's a loose bunch of stuff on labs i

1473
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,079
don't know what other stuff we want you

1474
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,280
want to cover or what if there's

1475
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,400
questions from the audience or stuff

1476
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,400
that you want yeah

1477
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,800
someone someone asked are inaccurate

1478
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,079
percentages fabricated by via false

1479
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,240
standards when using the gc

1480
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,880
uh which is what you mean a standard

1481
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,759
like so if you know yeah

1482
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,160
like

1483
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,920
i think the answer is yes lab results

1484
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,679
can be falsified they can also be

1485
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,358
there are all the time as we've

1486
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:16,799
explained with that 15 thing if you

1487
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,078
didn't understand and see that go back

1488
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,160
and watch it

1489
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,880
there is an inherent amount of normal

1490
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:26,000
variation and acceptable

1491
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,039
laboratory error that influences the

1492
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,559
end results right so like

1493
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:34,400
when you put in the flower

1494
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,839
and you get back that lab report that

1495
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,838
didn't come from god

1496
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,358
right yeah like i don't believe god that

1497
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:42,318
didn't somebody didn't hand that down to

1498
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,239
the divine and say this is the divine

1499
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,519
ultimate truth right like yeah yeah it's

1500
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:46,959
like hey we measured your [ __ ] this is

1501
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,719
the this is the measurement that we got

1502
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,920
here's the number and by the way what

1503
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,439
you should understand is that that

1504
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,480
number is like has an acceptable

1505
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,599
variation

1506
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,519
right

1507
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,400
on the other side of the question do

1508
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,838
people

1509
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,838
manipulate these laboratories

1510
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,880
yes absolutely

1511
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,400
in every district there have been

1512
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,920
laboratories that have had their bombs

1513
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,680
bank because

1514
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,760
like it's like you take like you know

1515
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,440
there was somebody they in a leafly

1516
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,119
article somebody did this

1517
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,960
and laid out like a thousand lab reports

1518
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,599
they took all the statistical averages

1519
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,838
of

1520
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,640
all these different labs and every lab's

1521
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,880
statistical average went on on a graph

1522
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,358
with a different color curve right oh

1523
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,280
wow you see like everybody is all lined

1524
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:33,279
over this one specific area and then you

1525
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,079
got one lab that's like shifted to the

1526
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,839
right

1527
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,680
their whole curve is like shifted to the

1528
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,679
right and it's like okay well what the

1529
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,679
[ __ ] are these guys doing wrong yeah

1530
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,879
right and the truth is

1531
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:47,279
it happens in every district

1532
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,000
higher lab results

1533
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,079
get more sales of course therefore

1534
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,880
there's an incentive for labs to give

1535
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,680
higher results because they're a profit

1536
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,559
for-profit service yeah and

1537
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,358
there's

1538
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,319
a benefit for growers to seek those labs

1539
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:04,000
out

1540
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,279
and maybe pay a little bit more for a

1541
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
higher number

1542
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,480
right

1543
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,480
and so

1544
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:12,960
i think that's a bad design yeah i think

1545
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,920
the answer you can't go back to that

1546
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,318
question

1547
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,119
do do labs manipulate let's not say all

1548
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,639
labs but say a percentage of labs do

1549
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,798
manipulate

1550
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,078
and that can be done intentionally or

1551
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:25,759
unintentionally

1552
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,000
yeah the the way it's set up is right

1553
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,079
for corruption if if one wants to be

1554
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,880
corrupt

1555
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,559
it's

1556
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,240
you have to it again it's about this

1557
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,920
passion thing that we were talking about

1558
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,558
what are you seeking

1559
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,880
are you speaking to market a product or

1560
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,319
are you seeking the ultimate truth yeah

1561
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,400
are you seeing any answers cannabis

1562
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:46,400
understanding right and like

1563
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,639
if you're not controlling that agenda

1564
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,640
you're getting played by it right so if

1565
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,118
you're a consumer that's true unless you

1566
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,798
know like say for example like

1567
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,640
you know you i go through all the stuff

1568
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,480
and you say to me you know dude i really

1569
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:01,440
want to be like high integrity seed bank

1570
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,358
we're going to do everything the right

1571
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,760
way and you show up you're doing it the

1572
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:05,759
right way

1573
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:10,239
i'm going to have more faith than you

1574
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,439
yeah

1575
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,039
um and then if like i resonate with that

1576
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,440
kind of thing and i say hey matt's doing

1577
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,358
all the thing look he's demonstrating

1578
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,880
that like hey i got this lab report but

1579
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,639
maybe it was a little high i don't know

1580
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,798
like something's questionable that shows

1581
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,679
that you got integrity if i'm a customer

1582
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,599
i'm gonna support that yeah right

1583
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,798
um but these are again that's like a

1584
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,318
value judgment of something that i value

1585
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,239
other than i might not value those

1586
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,000
things right like because as you can see

1587
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,358
like a lot of other people are like well

1588
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,199
[ __ ] that the jungle boys is the hottest

1589
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,798
[ __ ] i'm gonna go grab whatever they got

1590
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,039
you know what i mean yeah they don't the

1591
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,079
value system is not the same so anyway

1592
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:47,920
next question

1593
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,519
and the education system's not the same

1594
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,880
i mean like that what we've been trying

1595
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,039
to do with the whole breeder syndicate

1596
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,119
thing has been it's been tough because

1597
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,639
we decided a long time ago the only way

1598
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,480
to combat

1599
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,960
disinformation and misinformation is to

1600
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,119
educate but you can't force people to

1601
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,920
want to educate themselves

1602
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,200
no you can't all you can do is

1603
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,079
lay it out for the people that want to

1604
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,000
know

1605
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,079
yeah and

1606
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,280
i've been pushing this uphill for a long

1607
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,519
time

1608
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,798
um

1609
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,079
more people are getting to the point

1610
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:18,880
where they want to know

1611
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,839
yeah

1612
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,798
right

1613
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,599
um

1614
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,440
and it's changing right i mean just it's

1615
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,599
changing over time but yeah it takes

1616
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,720
time and you know it's like everything

1617
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,400
it's like

1618
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,798
you know what you and i consider good

1619
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,720
music that ain't what's on the top 40.

1620
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,159
right and the cannabis industry is going

1621
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,439
to be no different like there's going to

1622
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,719
be people that really understand they're

1623
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,798
really passionate and they really want

1624
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,719
that's a compared beautiful things

1625
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,358
and then there's like

1626
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,399
the 90 that are gonna listen to justin

1627
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,358
bieber

1628
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,200
yeah right and smoke bieber butt

1629
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:52,798
so

1630
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,078
i have some i have some questions i want

1631
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,119
to run through

1632
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,960
it it refers to testing but it refers to

1633
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,760
genetic testing

1634
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,760
uh are you cool with that yeah sure okay

1635
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,200
um

1636
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,319
this is kind of i don't know i mean i

1637
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,798
don't know if there's an answer to it

1638
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,880
necessarily but do you know how far we

1639
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,519
are in mapping the cannabis genome as

1640
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,318
far as are we able to tell

1641
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:20,318
real genetic relation as far as like s1

1642
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:22,239
variation and and parental lines father

1643
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,480
cousin sister is that even something in

1644
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,159
cannabis that you can do

1645
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,240
yeah you can do it

1646
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,159
i can't go and like seek that

1647
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,159
information out so one of the weird

1648
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,358
things with the filos

1649
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,118
was going on you know they were doing

1650
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,480
the run around trying to get samples and

1651
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,599
they obviously approached me at one

1652
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,798
point in time and i was like not

1653
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,119
interested

1654
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:42,559
yeah but what i will do is i said hey

1655
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,480
i've got all these

1656
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,319
self populations

1657
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,838
why don't i help why don't we look at

1658
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,199
like 50 individuals from the self

1659
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,679
population and then explore the

1660
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:54,239
variations so then now we've got like

1661
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,399
we've we've shown hey here's like the

1662
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,959
parental clone here's the

1663
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,519
heterozygosity by sequencing

1664
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,639
yeah growing 100 offspring of themselves

1665
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,119
do the same thing to each other they

1666
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,078
didn't want to do that [ __ ] yeah

1667
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,838
um

1668
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,160
it seemed like that was the most

1669
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,318
like what people went to philos for was

1670
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,199
that information more so than anything

1671
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,199
else

1672
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,798
they were just weird they had the pitch

1673
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,118
was great it was like

1674
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,880
collect your star on the galaxy

1675
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,400
yeah right like and it was like it's

1676
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,318
kind of like that whole like

1677
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,720
we can show you your name it'll be up in

1678
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:28,880
lights yeah you know like it's [ __ ]

1679
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:33,838
nonsense but that's it people fall and

1680
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,838
fall for that [ __ ] right yeah so um

1681
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,679
when we when i don't mean we but i mean

1682
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,679
when

1683
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,000
humanity first

1684
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,519
did the human genome project it was like

1685
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,119
oh my god we're going to know everything

1686
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,239
we've got the whole genomes and that

1687
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,760
would be able to treat disease and it's

1688
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:50,798
like wait a second

1689
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,960
it's like you've got one white guy

1690
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,639
yeah right like do you think that that

1691
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,440
encompasses the genetic variation that

1692
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,598
exists in like the jewish or the or the

1693
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,358
afghan or the african population of like

1694
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,760
the north yeah yeah

1695
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,279
south africa or like asia versus you

1696
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,640
know like wherever

1697
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,040
right and so

1698
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:11,759
the next evolution that came out of that

1699
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,880
was called the thousand genomes project

1700
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,400
right and it's like once you got a

1701
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,720
thousand genomes now you can start

1702
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,559
looking at all the different genes and

1703
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:21,598
seeing okay here's kind of like a

1704
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,359
catalog of the in the genomic variation

1705
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,160
that exists in the species

1706
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:27,358
or

1707
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:29,920
like at least it gives us a look at hey

1708
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,838
there's way more varieties right and so

1709
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,200
we're not at the point with cannabis

1710
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:37,599
yeah so there are you know

1711
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,439
folks like medicinal genomics and some

1712
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,440
other groups i think medicinal genomics

1713
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,720
probably have like i would say they've

1714
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,960
been doing it i think they've been doing

1715
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,879
it like more or less the longest

1716
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,639
and they so they've started to get like

1717
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,160
yeah you can go in and if you're one of

1718
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,078
their clients and you paid out your [ __ ]

1719
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,000
sequence you can compare

1720
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,400
you know your snips versus other

1721
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,960
essentially snip sir

1722
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,079
genetics misspelling isn't a word

1723
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,599
right yeah

1724
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,119
you can and because these things are

1725
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,160
repeated over time if you have like a

1726
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,920
genetic

1727
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,279
misspelling that happens in skunk and

1728
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,680
then you cross it into skunk northern

1729
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,079
lights and skunk caves and found

1730
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,838
like you have a probability of finding

1731
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,760
that

1732
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:18,159
misspelling in all of those different

1733
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,799
lines right yeah so over time you can

1734
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,759
use those to build like a family tree

1735
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,000
um

1736
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:27,359
but what we haven't really done a good

1737
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,519
job of at this point yet is saying

1738
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:34,000
this

1739
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:36,480
small genetic change results in x

1740
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,559
right okay so like we've got a bunch of

1741
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,719
dna letters and we can see there's

1742
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,000
variation in these dna letters but it's

1743
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,000
like okay what does that correlate to in

1744
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,480
a plant we don't know

1745
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,559
yeah right and that's the hard work is

1746
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,079
correlating the phenotypic data with the

1747
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:54,079
genetic data that makes sense and that

1748
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,079
is going to take time yeah that's got to

1749
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,280
be years away yeah but it's going to

1750
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,760
it's always going to be an ongoing

1751
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,680
process right yeah and with corn they've

1752
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,000
done it they've got a pretty good job of

1753
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,679
it now and like listen we've got like

1754
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,599
we've got what's called an annotated

1755
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,279
genome which means

1756
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,160
you can look up hey you want to look up

1757
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,160
like the uh

1758
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,200
fatty acid desaturates gene that is

1759
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,400
involved in like you know cell plant

1760
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,239
cells what happens when plants get

1761
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,318
really cold they increase the oil

1762
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,558
content and the cell membranes then

1763
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,480
there's a gene involved in that right so

1764
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,400
yeah like i can look up that gene and

1765
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,679
actually now go and find out exactly

1766
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,519
where it is in the canopy you know

1767
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,598
because they've said hey this small

1768
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,599
suction of the the chromosome matches up

1769
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,160
with this gene and all of the plants

1770
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,440
this is the gene that does this in

1771
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,679
cannabis

1772
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,599
right so but like again it's like you

1773
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,199
know that that gene that segment of dna

1774
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,119
signals there

1775
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,598
do we know what every variant that

1776
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,680
exists for that gene

1777
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,440
and the result of those variants are no

1778
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,440
we don't know that

1779
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,358
very interesting so we're starting to

1780
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,119
build that knowledge like one of the

1781
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:01,358
things you know recurrent medicinal

1782
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,119
genomics recurrence no dummy

1783
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:03,838
you know he looked he was like oh we're

1784
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,599
going to start looking at the

1785
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,038
cannabinoid synthase genes like that's

1786
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,119
going to be one of the first things so

1787
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,480
you know they sequence the whole genome

1788
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,599
but the first thing that they do they

1789
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,039
take the microscope up it's not a

1790
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,880
microscope or a magnifying glass but

1791
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,920
it's an analogy you take the magnifying

1792
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,160
glass out and you go and you look at

1793
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,920
that region of the genome that has those

1794
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,598
genes involved in cannabinoid production

1795
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,079
hey this one's got a break in the gene

1796
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,599
or this one has two copies of the gene

1797
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,519
right and so

1798
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,400
they're starting to tease it apart for

1799
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,199
like

1800
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,519
some of the major genes of interest

1801
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,038
yeah but because they don't grow plants

1802
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,798
and they don't do those correlational

1803
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,799
studies between genetic data and

1804
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:41,519
phenotypes

1805
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:44,480
they can't generate that kind of data

1806
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,719
yeah right it was it was slow build

1807
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,559
it was interesting going back and forth

1808
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,000
with filos at the very end before they

1809
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,200
shut their doors

1810
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,519
and

1811
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:56,000
giving them known parents

1812
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,440
and the known children cuts and watching

1813
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,199
them come back and say there is no

1814
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,920
relation it was really interesting

1815
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:04,000
watching that and they they put their

1816
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,760
their whole reputation on the line to do

1817
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,039
it on top of that well it makes you

1818
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,039
wonder what's going on because i mean

1819
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,119
you know they are so it's like did they

1820
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,559
[ __ ] up the samples lab are they not

1821
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,000
just not running them and taking your

1822
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,760
money and telling you

1823
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,519
right like that could be yeah too right

1824
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,440
you have no way of knowing

1825
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:23,280
you have no way of knowing and and when

1826
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,119
we pointed it out they shut the doors so

1827
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,359
i guess i i don't know i i'd like to see

1828
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,920
how long their data stays up online

1829
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,759
their data sets because knowing that it

1830
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,440
i i would think that if the more that

1831
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,440
gets out the more likely people are to

1832
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,240
start asking questions

1833
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,000
i

1834
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,199
i had like listen when they first

1835
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,119

like

1855
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,118
the way that they were going and

1856
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,400
collecting their data

1857
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,240
was wrong

1858
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,760
right and just because of

1859
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:25,279
you know not who i am but because of

1860
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,119
like the position i was in with knowing

1861
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,839
a lot of people on the internet yeah

1862
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,760
yeah and having access to like you know

1863
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,920
all the known stuff i was like guys like

1864

1865
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,480
yeah

1866
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,838
and then it's verified cuts and you know

1867
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,519
when you're doing a catatonic that it

1868
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,279
came from the guy that read cam chronic

1869
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,318
right like yeah yeah exactly you know

1870
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,440
and they were like well we don't want to

1871
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,798
do that

1872
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,559
they didn't want we got real legacy

1873
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:48,719
strength you know we got fearless like

1874
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,400
well why not it's like oh you want to

1875
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:51,919
take people's money to give them an

1876
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,440
answer

1877
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,920
right because they were running a test

1878
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,119
their cost was 30 100 bucks or whatever

1879
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,720
it was and they're charging people

1880
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,519
hundreds of dollars right so

1881
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,519
yeah

1882
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,079
they're just turning and burning

1883
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,599
um and in the meantime they're learning

1884
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,318
all this stuff because they see

1885
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:10,880
everybody's samples or like the guy that

1886
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,318
pays the test you only see your sample

1887
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,280
right yeah it's like you understand your

1888
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:14,719
genetic

1889
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,640
data

1890
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:18,318
to whatever degree

1891
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,679
you can say oh look there's my star on

1892
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:21,759
the galaxy

1893
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,118
yeah right it's kind of like buying an

1894
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,400
anchor on the moon

1895
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,160
right yeah like you can see with the

1896
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,000
telescope who cares it's like [ __ ]

1897
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,440
useless

1898
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,440
yeah dude

1899
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,440
um

1900
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,719
so but anyway you know

1901
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,000
anyway it's one of those things where

1902
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:39,838
it's like i don't know if you're thought

1903
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,358
to read tom sawyer but it's like there's

1904
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:42,639
a certain point in time he has to paint

1905
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:44,719
whitewash the stupid fats and

1906
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:46,480
everybody's like yeah yeah hey tom can i

1907

give you my like apple if you let me

1908
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,079
whitewash some of your fence that's kind

1909
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,599
of what phylos was doing with the

1910
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,079
cannabis industry right everybody was

1911
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,318
lining up like suckers to be remembered

1912
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,680
it all turned like because of i did that

1913
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:59,199
breeding work from napro then there was

1914
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:00,960
the patent that came from it like a lot

1915
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,960
of people all bent out of shape and it

1916
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,318
was like you're [ __ ] filos you're

1917
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,960
working with filos and patenting all

1918
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:09,279
this stuff and i was like wait a second

1919
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,798
all you dumbasses fell into the [ __ ]

1920
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,280
philos trap

1921
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,199
you actively paid to give away your

1922
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,240
[ __ ] information to some big genetics

1923
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,639
company

1924
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,798
and you're pissed off at me like why

1925
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,558
don't you ask me mad at me like you fell

1926
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:23,759
into the trap dude

1927
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,880
right

1928
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,799
um

1929
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,720
so i don't know the cannabis is

1930
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:29,838
you know community is funny with that

1931
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:31,199
stuff because it's like yeah like the

1932
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,000
patents already freaked out about the

1933
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,199
patents and now everybody wants a patent

1934
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,559
right yeah

1935
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,759
literally everyone

1936
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,480
yeah

1937
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,280
and

1938
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,960
like

1939
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,798
i think if you truly bred something and

1940
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,720
you created something new then you can

1941
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:46,400
get intellectual property protection by

1942
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,318
way of a patent like a plant patent in

1943
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,720
the states [ __ ] get on with your bad

1944
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:51,838
self now now why not now it's got to now

1945
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:54,239
it's got to the point of where you

1946
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,759
almost have to if you want to stay

1947
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,519
competitive because the legal market's

1948
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,119
coming and if you don't patent it

1949
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,519
someone else will it's just it's going

1950
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:03,519
to happen well they can't nobody can

1951
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,960
so somebody can't come along patent your

1952
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:06,239
[ __ ]

1953
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,519
um

1954
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:08,959
they can patent something that is the

1955
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:11,519
same as your [ __ ] if you didn't get to

1956
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,559
it in time yeah sure

1957
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:14,239
but yeah

1958
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,079
really like what a patent is saying hey

1959
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:17,278
this this unique thing that i developed

1960
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,119
is mine

1961
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,640
and yeah this gives you a stamp that

1962
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,358
says hey that you actually developed

1963
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,798
that because you have to demonstrate

1964
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,759
how you made it

1965
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:27,278
okay

1966
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,798
like you have to say to people i crossed

1967
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,920
this and this we did these selections

1968
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:31,519
and there's all things like role

1969
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,158
descriptions right do you have to have

1970
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,319
actual proof that you crossed x y z and

1971
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,960
the proof of all this like video like do

1972
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,239
you know how it works it has to stand up

1973
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,920
in court

1974
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,838
right because it can be challenged at

1975
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,000
any point in time so if you don't do a

1976
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:48,238
good enough job like you might get it

1977
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,319
past the uspto you met you might get

1978
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,718
past the patent examiner and he says

1979
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,480
yeah this thing appears

1980
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,920
whatever but if somebody comes along and

1981
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,599
and challenges it later and they can

1982
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,520
demonstrate later

1983
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,880
that that hey

1984
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,120
you didn't

1985
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,039
document well enough and there's these

1986
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:08,079
things that call what you said into

1987
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:10,079
question that's up in front of the judge

1988
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:12,399
yeah who's going to make a ruling on

1989
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,000
whether you actually the patent is valid

1990
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,439
a patent is a claim right it doesn't

1991
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,039
mean that you wouldn't hit it to claim

1992
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,719
that you own something

1993
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:20,399
right whether you really own it is a

1994
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,880
matter for the cards

1995
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,158
yeah right and so like any patent can be

1996
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,400
challenged

1997
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:29,198
um and so if you're going to go through

1998
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,719
a patent and all the effort and expense

1999
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,119
of getting a patent for something that

2000
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,119
you've created you should probably do a

2001
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:36,798
good job of describing everything like

2002
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:38,798
all your homework every last step yeah

2003
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,838
because you want to lay out the whole

2004
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:41,679
story

2005
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:42,798
so some because the story is what gets

2006
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,640
published in the patent if somebody

2007
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,880
comes along and says yeah this doesn't

2008
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,440
make sense in your story that's ground

2009
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,199
for a challenge yeah and so

2010
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,559
that's why when you see like you know

2011
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,238
i'm not talking about plant patents but

2012
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,679
if you read some of these patents on

2013
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,759
like genes

2014
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,520
you know it's like

2015
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,719
or for example in a chemotype so it'll

2016
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,960
be like

2017
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,760
we're patenting every plant in

2018
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,000
terpenoline dominance with uh type three

2019
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,560
or type two you know cannabinoid profile

2020
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,039
meaning cbd and cbg and that means

2021
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,800
everything from one percent two percent

2022
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,119
three percent four percent five percent

2023
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,039
six yeah and you'll literally see them

2024
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,559
[ __ ] list out like you know one

2025
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,279
through forty percent

2026
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:25,760
right yeah for clarity that they say

2027
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,198
this patent claims every plant that is

2028
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,560
one percent two percent three percent

2029
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,359
four percent yeah

2030
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,840
and it's like you document it as tightly

2031
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:36,319
controlled as possible and the idea

2032
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,159
for that patent attorneys do is like

2033
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:40,079
you want to write patents that are

2034
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:42,639
defensible in the future

2035
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,399
so you try to close every loophole that

2036
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,440
you can think of

2037
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:46,719
right

2038
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:48,960
is and patents are different than

2039
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,279
trademarks i know archive trademarks

2040
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,079
yeah trademarks are some there's a trick

2041
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:55,198
yeah

2042
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:57,359
trademark is how you sell a product

2043
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:59,119
okay okay look

2044
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:02,079
when we start talking about intellectual

2045
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:03,760
property on plants

2046
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,158
it's

2047
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,760
who wherever the person is watching this

2048
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:09,039
in the world like if you're in europe or

2049
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,560
in your canada or you're in the united

2050
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:12,960
states or you're in china

2051
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,520
totally different okay yeah

2052
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,439
there's something in in the

2053
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,840
this there's a system that is like

2054
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:22,799
accepted all over the world

2055
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,400
called um upof and upon essentially the

2056
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,199
union for the protection of plant

2057
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:29,198
varieties and and they're the guys that

2058
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,439
created this overarching system that

2059
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:31,439
said

2060
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,840
these are the ways that we evaluate to

2061
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,119
see who owns or develops a new plant

2062
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,640
variety

2063
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:41,119
yeah but it's an international treaty

2064
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,880
made by an international organization

2065
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,158
all the countries come together most of

2066
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,560
the countries in the world come together

2067
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:47,599
and have signed this treaty but like for

2068
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,440
example

2069
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,280
you know

2070
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,839
they call it like new zealand say they

2071
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:56,079
signed on in like the 1974 edition of

2072
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,319
the treaty and the united states signed

2073
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,279
on in like a later version call it 1991

2074
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,920
right

2075
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,759
made up numbers and dates sure you're

2076
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,920
only beholden to the version of the

2077
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,390
treaty to which you signed

2078
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,520
yeah okay so and then

2079
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,119
[Music]

2080
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,880
you sign the treaty all these like for

2081
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,640
example they go home you know so there's

2082
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,560
this international treaty the united

2083
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,000
states signs on the international trade

2084
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,360
hey we're gonna be part of this thing

2085
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,119
now they go back to the united states

2086
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,719
and they write a set of legislation that

2087
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,559
backs up the treaty

2088
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,319
yeah well that legislation is totally

2089
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,080
unique to the united states

2090
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,559
right like you follow the overarching

2091
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:33,039
principles of the

2092
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,159
the umbrella organization that top level

2093
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:35,119
org

2094
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:36,879
but

2095
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:38,319
really every country is a silo with

2096
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,119
their own system

2097
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:40,719
yeah

2098
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:44,559
and so

2099
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,840
patents plant patents per se

2100
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,960
only exist in the united states in

2101
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,640
australia

2102
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,319
okay like that makes sense there is no

2103
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,280
such thing

2104
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:54,399
plant patent in canada or europe yeah

2105
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:56,479
we use

2106
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:59,119
um breeders rights the breeder's right

2107
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:00,559
system that's overthinking by upon

2108
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,000
um

2109
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,719
one of the major differences between

2110
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,479
those two is that a patent

2111
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:10,079
you don't have to disclose or make

2112
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:10,079
available so for example

2113
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,759
when we talk about international

2114
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,239
registration of plant varieties or plant

2115
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,280
cultivars

2116
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:21,359
what that does is so so i develop

2117
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:22,639
whatever call it like a blueberry sweets

2118
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,000
it's called a blueberry sweet skunk

2119
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,920
plant i find a blueberry sweet snail

2120
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,158
plant it's totally different i register

2121
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,119
it i declare the parents i do the whole

2122
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,439
spiel

2123
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,039
yeah but he says okay ryan this plant is

2124
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:35,359
yours we recognize that you're the

2125
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,880
developer of this plant this one plant

2126
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,158
that you selected out of this population

2127
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,679
we're going to give you a cultivar

2128
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,439
registration

2129
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,840
recognition so it's a registered

2130
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:46,639
cultivar

2131
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,000
what you get out of that is the rice you

2132
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,400
don't get the plant

2133
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,920
yeah so it's like now that plant that i

2134
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:53,279
have that i that

2135
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,719
anybody that wants to grow that plant

2136
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,880
anywhere else in the world

2137
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,800
they can kill that plant but i get the

2138
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,400
royalties or you know

2139
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,640
like i have the rights to the royalties

2140
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,639
or whatever profits come from

2141
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,239
the development section of that plant

2142
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,320
what you don't get to say is nobody else

2143
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:11,279
can use this plan in fact one of the

2144
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:13,679
conditions that you have to do

2145
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:14,800
is make your plant available to other

2146
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,880
breeders

2147
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,039
oh interesting yeah and the the reason

2148
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,800
is is like hey

2149
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:22,880
the reasoning from the top level org is

2150
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,719
hey we recognize that you develop that

2151
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,480
plant and it's special it's awesome and

2152
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,960
it's unique and we're going to give you

2153
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:32,000
17 years of economic

2154
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:35,359
exclusivity around that plant

2155
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,600
plant genetic resources are not yours

2156
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:41,119
yes the entire globe has the right

2157
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,679
everybody on the planet has the right to

2158
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:46,158
that plant

2159
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,000
for use in the betterment of all plants

2160
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:49,920
for humanity

2161
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,840
therefore the plant that you have the

2162
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,440
certification on

2163
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,440
we recognize it as yours but you have to

2164
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,960
share it with everybody else yeah right

2165
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:58,719
and so other people can take my [ __ ] and

2166
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,239
breed it and improve it

2167
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,920
yeah if i have a patent i don't have to

2168
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,158
give it out to anybody

2169
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,319
uh okay i got you right you can control

2170
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,319
who gets it right because it truly is

2171
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:10,639
your piece of property it's your you

2172
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:12,399
have ownership over that thing

2173
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,760
gotcha um that makes that's that's yeah

2174
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:15,759
that makes a lot of sense it's kind of a

2175
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,520
weird like unique thing that happens in

2176
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,560
the states because you guys have these

2177
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,000
patents

2178
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,039
they're recognized in australia they're

2179
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,079
not recognized anywhere else in the

2180
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,800
world

2181
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,760
not even canada no that's funny yeah

2182
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,920
yeah

2183
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,119
yeah so that's one form of patents

2184
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,640
there's other forms of patents like

2185
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,079
there's utility patents and there's all

2186
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,520
this other [ __ ] so

2187
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,119
but i think

2188
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,719
you know rather than doing a show on

2189
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,359
patents it's just good to recognize that

2190
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:41,439
that's kind of the way it is so yeah get

2191
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,439
yourself a plan you can also do cultivar

2192
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,198
and variety registrations in

2193
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:46,719
the united states i think with patents

2194
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,759
around why would you

2195
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:53,359
yeah right the thing about being part of

2196
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,640
the international variety registration

2197
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,119
is that

2198
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,239
you you don't only have record like for

2199
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,760
you if you're only growing and your

2200
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:00,959
clients are only in the states fine it

2201
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,800
doesn't matter get your patent in the

2202
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,679
states you're protected you you're

2203
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,440
you've

2204
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,640
you're protected in the space take that

2205
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:08,479
plant to

2206
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,039
europe

2207
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,718
nobody recognizes your ip

2208
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:14,000
yeah so

2209
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,520
you know you might want if you're going

2210
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,600
to be doing business internationally you

2211
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,960
might want to get

2212
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,239
a form of intellectual property

2213
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,840
protection that is recognized

2214
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:23,678
internationally

2215
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,119
okay

2216
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,960
so we've got a question for you i want

2217
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,519
to hear chimera talk about kitazan

2218
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,719
jasmonic acid and salicylic acid is this

2219
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,840
something that you

2220
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,119
know a lot about

2221
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,880
i know i mean i know a little bit about

2222
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,039
them i'm not like a plant physiology guy

2223
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,039
and i have that stuff on the top of my

2224
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,119
on the top of my head i mean they're

2225
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:43,198
they're signaling chemicals right yeah

2226
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,479
so chi doesn't kitazan's not kitazan is

2227
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:47,279
an additive is that it's like what's

2228
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,678
that's the molecule that's in

2229
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:50,639
uh the shells of crustaceans right yeah

2230
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,079
so there's

2231
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,760
some evidence that it does stuff and

2232
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:55,519
plants and that's not my area of

2233
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,840
specialty

2234
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,440
so i want to talk to you about what is

2235
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,440
chimera

2236
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,439
excited about genetically that's around

2237
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:05,439
right now something you're working on or

2238
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:06,799
something that maybe you saw recently

2239
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:09,039
that you're really stoked on that's

2240
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,279
novel

2241
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:15,039
my list not i get off on the variation

2242
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:17,279
so i like new stuff i like i like

2243
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:18,800
i like when our understanding grows

2244
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,279
right so it's like you can use it

2245
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,119
because for me in genetics

2246
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,519
it's like i you know we talked about a

2247
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,119
little bit with caleb on the shango show

2248
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,040
the other day but yeah like when you're

2249
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:30,399
solving a plan it's not just about

2250
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:32,079
looking through the population and

2251
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,319
saying hey oh this plant's great because

2252
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:35,679
of whatever i want to understand all the

2253
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,000
traits and the plant and how they're

2254
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:39,520
inherited right and how it's breeding

2255
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,800
it's kind of like being able to take a

2256
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,080
part machine

2257
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,199
once you can take it apart and put it

2258
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,519
back together

2259
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:47,119
then you can reassemble it in new ways

2260
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,560
yes right and so

2261
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:50,640
that's really what get you know like

2262
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,880
when for example the file story came out

2263
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,760
right in the the skunk compound yeah

2264
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,800
yeah

2265
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,800
super interesting

2266
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,559
i want to now be able to go into a

2267
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:03,519
breeding program

2268
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,159
take a plant with styles self it

2269
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,760
and see how does the

2270
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:10,000
like what happens in the distribution of

2271
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,920
that thiol expression in the offspring

2272
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,600
yeah right because when you analyze that

2273
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,760
then you can kind of get to understand

2274
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,800
then you can develop a hypothesis about

2275
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,640
how

2276
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,000
that trade is inherited

2277
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,920
yeah once you know how that trade is

2278
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,319
inherited then you can bring it into any

2279
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,319
other breeding program sure right so

2280
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,000
that's like kind of what i nerd on it's

2281
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:30,479
not probably that's very exciting to

2282
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,319
people no i mean it's like yeah yeah

2283
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:33,839
that's the kind of stuff that i like so

2284
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:35,599
you know i don't really

2285
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,719
like

2286
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,280
that there's i have favorites but

2287
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:43,439
you know when i look at cannabis i don't

2288
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:45,840
really look at it in that almost call it

2289
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,198
like a prejudicial way

2290
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,440
where we're segregating plants on

2291
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:50,960
quality and i only like one type

2292
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,639
you know what i mean like

2293
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,640
i've got my favorite dogs but for

2294
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,640
cannabis

2295
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,319
i see the very i see the inherent value

2296
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:02,559
in all of it

2297
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:04,319
yeah right you know that makes sense

2298
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,760
funky like rudorah stuff with the

2299
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,359
autoflowering i mean that was like i

2300
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,400
collect that stuff you know yeah like

2301
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:09,839
when i'm in morocco when i was in

2302
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:11,198
morocco i found these plants there

2303
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,360
there's a there's a hemp variety called

2304
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,599
panorama and essentially

2305
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,599
that the plant grows like a globe

2306
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,640
so like all the branches are completely

2307
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,640
equal so it makes like this round bush

2308
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,640
oh wow right and this half breeder in

2309
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,320
him even bosch years ago he developed a

2310
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,480
variety of it for

2311
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:30,319
um like as an ornamental variety it was

2312
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:31,759
like it was at the time it was the only

2313
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:33,679
ornamental cannabis variety that had

2314
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,960
been bred yeah and he thought oh yeah

2315
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,359
people planted their garden yeah with

2316
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,960
these little weird glove balls

2317
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:40,799
um anyway i found a plant like that in

2318
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,640
morocco and i was like [ __ ] you like

2319
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,960
take some seeds out of that sucker and

2320
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,239
take it home yeah right

2321
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,319
it's an oddity

2322
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:50,639
yeah it's an oddity it's not in the

2323
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,158
current cannabis massive gene pool as

2324
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,199
far as what's being worked with you

2325
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:54,719
never know what it's going to offer

2326
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,319
different like i like the difference

2327
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,719
like i really do get off on the

2328
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,960
variation that you see in the species

2329
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:05,279
yeah um because i don't think anybody's

2330
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:07,198
done a very good job at like

2331
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:09,439
characterizing the variation that exists

2332
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:10,719
on any given set of trades right well in

2333
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:12,799
april we did we started doing a pretty

2334
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,639
good job on terps

2335
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,079
and then once we you know what we did

2336
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,760
terps at first and then we were like you

2337
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,679
know you end up with a plant that has

2338
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,400
the same terpene terpene profile and

2339
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:24,719
you've got two plants that are identical

2340
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,920
that's that look identical by lab report

2341
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,439
but you smell them they're totally

2342
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,359
different you're like okay

2343
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:31,439
this is clearly not the whole story we

2344
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:34,000
need to look at other chemicals so you

2345
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:36,238
pull out the gcms and you start looking

2346
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,158
for

2347
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,079
regions between your peaks it's like

2348
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,079
what else is in there that we're

2349
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:43,920
like just driving over right we're

2350
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,279
passing in the analysis

2351
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,880
and then you start looking at that and

2352
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:48,639
then you find oh there's other scent

2353
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,159
molecules that are involved in other

2354
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:52,480
molecules with scent that are involved

2355
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:53,759
in our perception perception of smell

2356
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:56,959
because again it's like i've used this

2357
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,800
analogy before but it's like

2358
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,960
it's kind of like going to the orchestra

2359
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,480
and then and then turn to the guy that's

2360
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,000
never heard orchestra music and saying

2361
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:06,319
hey did you hear the oboe

2362
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,639
yeah right it's like yeah yeah he he

2363
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:10,319
perceives that in the overall sound of

2364
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,639
what he's perceiving is the sound of the

2365
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,479
orchestra but he hasn't trained himself

2366
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,760
to be able to like identify that one

2367
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:19,599
note right

2368
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:22,480
yeah um and scent is an orchestra

2369
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,400
yeah it is molecules right and when we

2370
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:27,519
smell those molecules we get them all at

2371
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:28,399
once that we perceive it as one thing

2372
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,560
but really

2373
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:31,920
it's one thing it's like it's kind of

2374
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,199
like looking at the mona lisa it's like

2375
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,119
you can say yeah it's one painting well

2376
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:36,879
yeah it's one painting but it's like

2377
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:39,439
look at all the intricacy that exists in

2378
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,600
it right all the brush details yeah

2379
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:42,799
yeah and that's really the difference

2380
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,320
between

2381
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,639
that's what happens when you you know i

2382
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:47,840
did i missed the thing last night but i

2383
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,279
imagine it's the kind of stuff that you

2384
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,360
guys were talking about last night right

2385
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:53,119
like yeah we went through his kit and i

2386
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:55,679
i i went through and smelled each

2387
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:57,198
individual one like the terpenes they're

2388
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,800
all in different percentages and whatnot

2389
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:00,000
but yeah it was fascinating there were

2390
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,079
certain ones that i was smelling like

2391
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,359
lemonade and a few others that i just it

2392
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:05,198
totally wasn't what i thought it would

2393
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,639
be like i like it smells like oranges

2394
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:08,319
doesn't it it's like yeah yeah there's

2395
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,719
there's a few different limonines in

2396
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:12,719
there but yeah it was it was wild man

2397
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,800
uh he he wants to send you one of the

2398
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,039
full kits too if you ever want it cool

2399
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,880
i'll check it out for sure yeah um he he

2400
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,800
wanted to know crybaby uh i'm curious

2401
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:23,119
how soma clonal variants fit into the

2402
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,840
whole plant patents or whole patent

2403
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:25,840
sphere

2404
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:31,600
soma clonal variants okay so semicolon

2405
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:33,759
variation is

2406
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,360
like let's call it it's usually referred

2407
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,159
to as the genetic variation that comes

2408
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:38,639
out of

2409
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,439
tissue culture but you can yeah really

2410
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,840
so

2411
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:44,559
a somatic cell is like any cell in your

2412
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,239
body that is not destined to become like

2413
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,840
sperm or egg

2414
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:49,839
okay right so like yeah

2415
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,520
uh

2416
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:56,319
audio cut for a second

2417
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,320
oh we dropped

2418
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:01,359
sorry so here we go you're good arms are

2419
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:03,039
just going to keep going off um

2420
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:05,599
so some tone of variation is like the

2421
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,479
variation that exists as a result of the

2422
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,920
plant

2423
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,519
growing

2424
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,960
so like the somatic cell is like any

2425
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,120
cell in your body like i was saying it

2426
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,560
doesn't become a germline cell it

2427
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:16,079
doesn't become again it's not going to

2428
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,560
become a gamete

2429
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:18,559
yeah okay

2430
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:23,920
in plants we talk about it from what we

2431
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,079
see the variation that exists when

2432
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,480
plants come out of tissue culture like

2433
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:30,880
there's a variant that we recognize as a

2434
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:32,638
phenotypic variant which we're noticing

2435
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,440
a change in morphology

2436
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:35,440
yeah

2437
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,439
um

2438
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:38,479
probably what's happened is the hormones

2439
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:41,039
that we've been using in the tissue

2440
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:43,039
culture processes have caused a genetic

2441
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,479
mutation that is the result of that

2442
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:46,158
variation

2443
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:47,839
right so i guess

2444
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:49,759
i'm just trying to like repurpose the

2445
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,520
question to say like

2446
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,760
what's the degree of natural variation

2447
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,040
that exists in the cannabis plant right

2448
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,239
yeah there was a paper that was just

2449
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:57,519
done on this

2450
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:59,599
and i think there are some flaws in the

2451
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,520
paper but they they actually sequenced

2452
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,600
all these different plate like they took

2453
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,880
samples from a big mother plant called

2454
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,079
like you know it was like five or six

2455
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,679
feet tall it was actually not in the

2456
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:10,079
healthiest condition which

2457
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,679
you know yeah it was like i was like

2458
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,840
maybe that's that should have been

2459
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,279
documented in the study but bottom line

2460
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,880
is they took a whole bunch of

2461
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:18,719
samples of different shoot tips bottom

2462
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,719
of the plant top and plant medium middle

2463
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,239
part of the plant and lo and behold

2464
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,679
there's all this genetic mutation that

2465
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:25,759
exists even with just a mother plant

2466
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:28,319
forget tissue culture

2467
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:31,039
just within a mother plant now

2468
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:33,359
whether that is a a factor of them doing

2469
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:35,600
a bad analysis or not let's forget that

2470
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,439
and just assume that it happens

2471
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,840
okay

2472
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:42,559
plants and we've seen this in trees

2473
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,400
mutations happen as plants grow right so

2474
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,800
if you got like a plant that throws off

2475
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:48,719
two shoots right so this is the main one

2476
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,880
here you got two shoots coming off here

2477
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,800
when this guy has a mutation every cell

2478
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,239
that develops from that

2479
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,520
cell with a mutation is going to carry

2480
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:57,198
that mutation

2481
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,120
yeah right and so we've literally got

2482
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,479
two branches on a tree

2483
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,399
that are going off in different ways

2484
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:04,718
that have different genotypes if that

2485
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,559
genotype happens in a gene if that

2486
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,760
mutation happens in a gene that's

2487
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,679
important

2488
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,840
you know an important trait for cannabis

2489
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,960
that could lead to like a change in the

2490
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,639
planet

2491
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,920
yeah right and so yeah i don't know

2492
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,600
you're probably heard like someone's

2493
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,158
asking like a sport that's that is a

2494
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,239
sport but a sport is like a shoot with a

2495
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:24,479
mutation right and so for example i was

2496
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:26,479
just going to mention like every maybe

2497
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:28,079
people have heard about like pinot

2498
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:30,399
pinot noir is a grape variety he's been

2499
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,840
around for hundreds of years

2500
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:33,679
we actually have these new grapes that

2501
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:37,520
are called pinot noir or pinot blanc

2502
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:38,960
which means you know white and pinot um

2503
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,480
pinot gris

2504
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,600
pinot gris actually kind of a pinky

2505
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:45,919
grape pinky it's actually a sport that

2506
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,520
they found on like somebody was walking

2507
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,840
through a a

2508
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,199
vineyard of pinot noir and noticed that

2509
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,840
one branch

2510
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:55,359
on a plant had gray grapes not purple

2511
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,480
grapes like there was a mutation that

2512
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,719
happened

2513
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:00,559
yeah in the color gene

2514
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,960
right and maybe some other genes as well

2515
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,360
but the point is you snip off that

2516
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,760
that sport or that cutting

2517
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:10,000
that plant is actually different enough

2518
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,920
from the registered pinot noir variety

2519
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
that you can actually take pinot that

2520
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,239
new short the the new sport pinot gris

2521
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,520
or peanut butter and and well maybe not

2522
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:19,279
patented but you can register it for

2523
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,400
life i don't know yet

2524
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:22,960
patents is a little bit different

2525
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,079
because the way they unlock the way they

2526
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,359
they kind of characterize them is a

2527
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:26,158
little bit different

2528
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:28,238
okay

2529
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,839
um but yeah it's it's

2530
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:31,119
like you know when you do your plant

2531
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,719
registration it's like oh yeah the

2532
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,840
grapes are purple well if like you go

2533
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,520
back and it's like you've got this one

2534
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,840
where the grapes aren't purple it's

2535
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,760
obviously not the same variety

2536
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,560
yeah right or the same cultivar so you

2537
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,440
can get named as a new cultivar

2538
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,480
so

2539
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,960
um

2540
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:48,479
yeah truth is like

2541
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,119
these things happen

2542
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:53,279
they happen in plants the degree to

2543
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,880
which they happen in cannabis i'm i'm

2544
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,158
sure we know that they know we know that

2545
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,920
it happens

2546
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,519
i think the degree to which we know that

2547
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,239
it happens is probably still up in the

2548
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,679
air

2549
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:03,599
yeah so i don't know if that answers the

2550
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,840
question but uh

2551
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,639
maybe there's a little context for it

2552
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,000
yeah

2553
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,600
that's interesting

2554
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
um

2555
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,039
can you talk about and now we're going

2556
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,479
to

2557
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,399
some of your strains that you've done in

2558
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:17,839
the past can you talk about what my

2559
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:19,439
favorite strain i know we've probably

2560
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,760
gone over it before

2561
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,759
but since this is a new episode mental

2562
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,079
floss like that that was one that

2563
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,400
touched me i'm a i'm a [ __ ] for purples

2564
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:30,238
and it was one of it was made during an

2565
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:32,158
era where purples were pretty obscure at

2566
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,079
the time like the the purple craze had

2567
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:36,158
gone not many people were breeding with

2568
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,399
purples but mental floss always had this

2569
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:40,319
beautiful purple senescence during

2570
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,158
flower yeah can you talk about a little

2571
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:44,639
bit when it turns at the end it's a

2572
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:46,079
beautiful one like when

2573
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,920
it does one of those things i guess it's

2574
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,198
got a bunch of carotenoids in it the

2575
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,560
carotenoids like when you look at for

2576
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,079
example i don't know you you probably

2577
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,080
don't have maple trees down where you

2578
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,238
are you might have seen them in the fall

2579
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,079
they go from like green and then when

2580
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:59,119
the green the plant you know when the

2581
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:00,639
plants going in the fall and they're

2582
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:02,559
about to shed their leaves they pull as

2583
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:04,400
much resources back out of the leaves

2584
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,159
into the trunk yes right so they can

2585
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:08,238
save those those building blocks for

2586
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:10,479
next year and what's left what happens

2587
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,399
is so the plants go the leaves go from

2588
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,479
green to either red or yellow the reason

2589
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:15,679
they're red or yellow is because they've

2590
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,000
got

2591
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,480
um

2592
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,079
molecules in the leaf called carotenoids

2593
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:24,238
and carotenoids just comes from that

2594
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:25,519
yellow orangey pigment color that's why

2595
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:26,879
they're called that like kind of like

2596
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,600
carrots right

2597
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,840
but

2598
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,800
those carotenoids kind of hide behind

2599
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,360
the

2600
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,560
chlorophyll and so with metal floss

2601
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:37,920
again when you when you give it a good

2602
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,679
flush at the end yeah and the plant you

2603
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,158
know cannibalizes all that

2604
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,399
that chlorophyll you end up with these

2605
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:45,839
beautiful kind of rainbow

2606
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:47,679
yellow and purple leaves on the back

2607
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:51,199
that plant is also like

2608
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:53,520
it makes some of my favorite hash of any

2609
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:56,719
cannabis that i've ever come across

2610
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,800
um super flavorful it's strong it melts

2611
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:02,480
like [ __ ] hell when you uh someone's

2612
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,480
saying [ __ ] carrots yeah [ __ ] carrots

2613
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,679
when you eat when you it melts like

2614
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:09,198
crazy and it's also very up like i would

2615
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,560
smoke that stuff thinking i'm gonna have

2616
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:12,079
another puff and go to bed and you know

2617
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,920
i got to come here two hours later type

2618
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,600
it away you know yeah yeah like it just

2619
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,600
it gets you going

2620
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,560
and he heals like a [ __ ]

2621
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:23,600
so it's like it's just a great plant

2622
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,320
right uh where did you source your uh

2623
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,239
stuff for the incense haze

2624
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,840
that the incidence haze one of the

2625
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:31,519
parents is sweet skin the other one is a

2626
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,920
seed that came from this dude in new

2627
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,120
york state that or that said he got out

2628
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,880
of the piff

2629
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,399
so um

2630
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,400
i don't know if it is or not

2631
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:42,399
is his name was prank so i called it

2632
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,960
frank's incense haze yeah right because

2633
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,158
it really smelt like incense um when you

2634
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,079
grew it

2635
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:50,079
like it was the reason i paired that one

2636
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:51,679
with the sweet skunk is because the two

2637
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:53,760
terp like

2638
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,760
very oft not very often not very often

2639
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,600
you'll come across two plants

2640
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,520
that are so close to each other they

2641
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,719
could be the same plant

2642
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,679
yeah um

2643
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,840
and so

2644
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:05,600
sweet skunk in this plant were like in

2645
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,000
almost every sense identical to the part

2646
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,000
where like you'd walk into a room like

2647
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,520
you like when you got when you know if

2648
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,079
you have plans for like 10 15 years in

2649
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,400
your room yeah you get to learn like a

2650
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:18,158
little in you know idiosyncratic sorry

2651
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:19,359
idiosyncrasy with the leaf and the way

2652
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:20,960
that like

2653
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:22,960
you know the way that the leaves come

2654
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,960
off the main front or the serration

2655
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,039
pattern or whatever it is yeah you get

2656
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,279
to know them like a parent can identify

2657
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:32,319
twins right like one of the twins and so

2658
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:32,319
it's the same thing like

2659
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:35,119
and

2660
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:36,319
these plants would get confused right

2661
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,880
the people would conduct them all the

2662
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:40,079
time because they're so close together

2663
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,239
um

2664
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,000
anyway yeah it was so when those two

2665
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:45,119
came together so i didn't keep saying i

2666
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,960
was selling the sweet skin because i

2667
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:49,198
wanted to understand the inheritance

2668
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,399
pattern of some of the rare volatiles

2669
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:51,439
that are in it

2670
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:52,719
and

2671
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,479
the self

2672
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:55,600
although it's pure it's a little bit

2673
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,599
smaller

2674
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,199
you got a wider range of like because

2675
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,960
it's expressing all the all the the

2676
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:02,960
hidden variation that exists within one

2677
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,319
genome right or those that self

2678
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,079
population

2679
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:09,920
but when i cross those two sister

2680
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:12,960
planets together when i when i do a um

2681
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:15,520
what i do across using a reversal i'll

2682
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,039
always hit the plant to itself because

2683
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,360
usually you're trying to get that pure

2684
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:22,000
line but i also always while the

2685
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:24,238
pollen's flying i will just make a bunch

2686
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,679
of other crosses at the same time yeah

2687
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:27,198
so it's you have them so it's like when

2688
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,359
you're going down a program it's like oh

2689
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:31,519
hey i lost a trade or this line doesn't

2690
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,880
have a trait that i want you go back to

2691
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,199
the line with the trait you've already

2692
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,880
got a hybrid that's 50

2693
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:38,559
within the line you're working in right

2694
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,600
so

2695
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,120
some guy dude uh but anyway

2696
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,719
so when you cross those two things

2697
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:48,479
together this this the incense haze

2698
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:51,119
which was simply irresistible i mean

2699
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,158
they came out much bigger and better

2700
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:55,198
um

2701
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:57,119
and very consistent to type

2702
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:58,879
you know um

2703
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,519
so it kind of was the best of both

2704
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,279
worlds so when people ask me if like you

2705
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,920
know when they're when they're sniffing

2706
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:07,679
around that thing i always say hey

2707
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,679
get both of them you know get the self

2708
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,359
for breeding so you got the pure stock

2709
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,520
it's a little little more homozygous or

2710
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,319
a greater chance of being homozygous

2711
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,040
but

2712
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:19,198
the the hybrid performs the other one

2713
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,279
right in terms of like a grower's

2714
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,039
performance right oh sure you know it

2715
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,238
really depends on what what the customer

2716
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:25,279
is looking for

2717
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,119
i

2718
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,759
want to have time i really like to take

2719
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:31,599
my time to do it like a proper consult

2720
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,440
with someone because i'll come up and be

2721
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,800
like hey somebody grew this stuff that

2722
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:36,079
you know the lemon floss that's great i

2723
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,679
want to grow it and that's like what

2724
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,359
what are you doing it for like what are

2725
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,800
you using it for

2726
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,238
right because i don't want you to apply

2727
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,000
the seeds that you think you want i want

2728
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:46,959
you to have the seeds that are going to

2729
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,079
be the best for what you're doing

2730
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,639
right

2731
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,639
yeah so yeah

2732
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,960
is there a strain that you can think of

2733
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,400
that you have been looking for for many

2734
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,600
years or strain you'd like to encounter

2735
01:32:56,399 --> 01:32:59,599
from the past that you haven't

2736
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:02,158
i mean

2737
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:04,319
yeah

2738
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:06,079
again we had a straight discussion i

2739
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:09,119
think of it in terms of plants

2740
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:10,880
right like are there rare phenotypes

2741
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:12,719
that i've seen in the past that i don't

2742
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,319
that i'd love to see again sure i mean

2743
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,760
of course

2744
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:16,880
it's kind of one of those things that

2745
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,039
it's like

2746
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,279
if it comes by it passes without you

2747
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:23,279
grabbing a copy and then solving it like

2748
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,119
it may have gone to the wind

2749
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:26,639
yeah right so you got to recognize that

2750
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:28,639
it is but you know you're always looking

2751
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:29,920
for those things in the future

2752
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,920
we decided to plant when i was

2753
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,319
relatively young and it was called the

2754
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,399
scooty sweetie there's an island off of

2755
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:37,679
uh texas british columbia and the

2756
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:39,759
straight there

2757
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,920
yeah called lustian it's no power it's

2758
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,199
essentially a hippie commune and

2759
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,319
you know they grow a lot of dope up

2760
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:47,839
there um yeah and they this one like it

2761
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:48,880
was before i had ever i'd never even

2762
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,159
heard of the island at that point in

2763
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,000
time i was quite young living on the

2764
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,479
other side of the country and a friend

2765
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,600
of mine a friend of mine

2766
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:57,599
someone's asking what do we think of

2767
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,719
breeder's team yeah your questions are

2768
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,239
funny dude um anyway

2769
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,840
this this flower ended up back with me

2770
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,079
and it was amazing it was like

2771
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,960
incredibly electric super strong really

2772
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:09,359
up

2773
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,119
and unfortunately other than the name

2774
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:12,000
was gd sweetie

2775
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:14,158
i

2776
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,079
i never knew anything you know

2777
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:17,119
yeah i never knew what it was so it's

2778
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:18,960
like yeah for sure i'd love to come

2779
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:20,238
across those things

2780
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,679
um

2781
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:23,439
but it's like the beautiful girl that

2782
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:25,600
you dated in high school you might not

2783
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:26,879
find another one like it so marry her

2784
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,679
while you can

2785
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,520
yeah

2786
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,960
yeah okay

2787
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,639
well we need to get your genetics here

2788
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,319
in the states you know i know there's a

2789
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:35,600
lot of people who really want to grab

2790
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:36,880
chimera's stuff is there anywhere

2791
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,400
available in the states right now that

2792
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,039
people no i can't i can't sell any of

2793
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:40,638
the

2794
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:43,439
states unfortunately

2795
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:45,039
oh um there is that it's definitely like

2796
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:46,879
i said when i work down there

2797
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,960
part of you know becoming a landed

2798
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,840
immigrant is having your fingerprints

2799
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,319
scanned

2800
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,679
right so it's like me me sending seeds

2801
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:54,799
into the states ain't really a great

2802
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,039
idea

2803
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,960
yeah it's probably probably not but yeah

2804
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:01,198
maybe someone can um work on doing some

2805
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,279
chimera genetics out here that'd be cool

2806
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:04,879
yeah yeah in this case we have breeders

2807
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:07,840
retail is going to come up and get going

2808
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,359
again but they're a uk bank good so it's

2809
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,760
you know with them having done brexit

2810
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,599
it's a like it's a bit of a [ __ ] show

2811
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,800
right yeah not this it's not as easy to

2812
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,119
the business out of the uk it was but

2813
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,039
it's perfectly legal for us to do yeah

2814
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:20,479
so people that want to do that can you

2815
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,399
know get contact with me and we can hook

2816
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:23,919
you up to the uk

2817
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,759
um

2818
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,359
but unfortunately the way the laws are

2819
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,639
and with that whole

2820
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,880
fingerprint and having worked for the

2821
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,480
man thing it's like yeah

2822
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,760
it's not yeah

2823
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:34,799
that always

2824
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,840
though

2825
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,760
yeah

2826
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,760
that's where we're at

2827
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,880
um crybaby made a comment on your

2828
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,560
limoncello he said i thought the

2829
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,079
limoncello was very consistent was an

2830
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,080
excellent breeder i know he's done some

2831
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,840
stuff with it too yeah that's right

2832
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,920
right that's the that's the sweet skin

2833
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,000
itself it is pretty consistent smell

2834
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,079
wise there's a little bit of variation i

2835
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,439
find still in like in morphology if you

2836
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:56,800
grow enough plants of the flower

2837
01:35:55,439 --> 01:35:58,638
morphology

2838
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,639
and so that's just what i meant from

2839
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,840
that context like the smoking they're

2840
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:03,039
more or less someone said they're more

2841
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,319
or less the same but they're very close

2842
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:05,920
they're within

2843
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,158
that type

2844
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,000
um yeah but

2845
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:11,359
you know i wouldn't lay down if i was

2846
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,279
going to grow an indoor set of tables i

2847
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,479
wouldn't lay see down seed from those

2848
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:15,519
because there's just

2849
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:16,638
if you're trying to sell the flower

2850
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,719
there's a little for me there's a little

2851
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,800
bit too much inconsistency

2852
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,920
yeah yeah

2853
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,039
well is there anything else you want to

2854
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,039
cover before we uh

2855
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,040
locals up with seeds

2856
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:31,279
all of these new region x knees suck hey

2857
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:33,519
man there's seeds are available

2858
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:34,559
yes seeds are there yeah everybody

2859
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,400
listen everybody's you know what it's

2860
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,639
like everybody's gone for the cali stuff

2861
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:40,000
all right the cali kelly world owns the

2862
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,319
world

2863
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,238
it's you know spain on the worlds 10

2864
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:48,719
years ago bcu in the world 10 years

2865
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,718
before that it'll vary it'll move around

2866
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:52,158
the work right they're doing the work

2867
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:53,678
down there there's a lot of people

2868
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:55,839
they're growing seeds

2869
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,800
um yeah and listen that's the only way

2870
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,400
that we're going to come up with new

2871
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,000
better canvas keep growing seeds just

2872
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,439
[ __ ] keep growing seeds as much as

2873
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,880
it's appealing and you have to grow

2874
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:06,960
clones for your business model

2875
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,079
you know just keep those seeds because

2876
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,520
if you don't grow these we're never

2877
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:10,880
gonna find anything new

2878
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,199
and we're always gonna be stuck with the

2879
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,600
same [ __ ] that we had five years ago

2880
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:16,879
that's how it goes yeah

2881
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,719
yeah

2882
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,520
right and listen sometimes it's stuff

2883
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:23,679
from my you know it's like i i see i say

2884
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,440
i call it cannabis fashion right it's

2885
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:27,039
like i like to i like to hold on to old

2886
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:28,719
cuts because it's like they go out of

2887
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:30,079
favor but you bring them back like five

2888
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,600
ten years later and people are like i

2889
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:33,039
love that [ __ ]

2890
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,800
you know yeah like dude it's the mini

2891
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:36,719
skirt or the bell bottoms like they keep

2892
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,920
it it is back right

2893
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,840
so yeah

2894
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,600
i never thought i'd see skunk one make a

2895
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,480
comeback and it did you know a few years

2896
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,239
ago like what the [ __ ]

2897
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:47,519
part of the live laughing at the skunk

2898
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:49,919
one if somebody actually actually asked

2899
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,360
me to sit in and help use genetics to

2900
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,560
help referee this stuff because it's

2901
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:54,719
like you got like five guys in

2902
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,719
california they were like i've got the

2903
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,639
original skunk one that's like oh you do

2904
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,600
do you it's like yeah

2905
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,279
you're original you've never heard of

2906
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,760
sam you've heard of dave

2907
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:05,118
though no okay well then you don't have

2908
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,880
the original

2909
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:08,559
yeah right it's like it's funny again

2910
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,480
it's that whole ego thing that like

2911
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,320
people want to get together

2912
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:13,759
and you know and be like hey i got the

2913
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:14,719
original i'm the man

2914
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,039
right yeah

2915
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:18,960
like you know

2916
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:20,319
drunk [ __ ] wonderful it's an

2917
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,239
interesting plant but it's one of those

2918
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:24,000
things that like you know it was one of

2919
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:25,439
the first right the first relatively

2920
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,039
creating lines and

2921
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:28,799
dave started selling in holland and then

2922
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,639
every proceed company was like well

2923
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,400
selling we got to sell the skunk

2924
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,159
yes so it's like that dutch passion's

2925
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:35,920
got it and since he's got a copy of it

2926
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,599
and then everybody's got a copy of it

2927
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,719
every [ __ ] seed bank in the world

2928
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,960
more or less

2929
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,800
has a copy of it are they all original

2930
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,158
how much are they any like you know it'd

2931
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,679
be really interesting to have like an

2932
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,599
acre and have all of them and grow them

2933
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:49,199
all side by side and just see and see

2934
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,039
what they're like they're probably not

2935
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:52,960
they probably like not even you know

2936
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:55,279
they're probably not even alike

2937
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,880
yeah i'm sure they're not and this dude

2938
01:38:55,279 --> 01:39:00,000
that bought the seeds back in like you

2939
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,279
know 96 or whatever when he got them

2940
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,560
you probably didn't get them from the

2941
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:04,639
original guy

2942
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,000
right so yeah probably not is your stuff

2943
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:08,400
original

2944
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,238
you know yeah it's just it's a funny

2945
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:11,039
it's a funny thing i i

2946
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:14,000
i

2947
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:16,560
i was actually quite amused to see

2948
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,800
one of the most spread around scene

2949
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,840
varieties that existed in the last 50

2950
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,440
years

2951
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,600
have a bunch of new people pop up and be

2952
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:25,519
like yo i've got the original like yeah

2953
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,600
and then and throw down big dollars even

2954
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,520
though it's never been gone

2955
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,119
you know yeah like it's always been

2956
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,280
available and what like what is the

2957
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:35,118
original like yeah right like the

2958
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:37,039
original was a seed it was a named

2959
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:38,238
population it wasn't like

2960
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:40,399
you know it's not like today it's like

2961
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:42,959
oh gee kush or cookies or [ __ ] runs

2962
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:44,479
or whatever like these start as cuttings

2963
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,840
right it always makes me laugh it's like

2964
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:48,158
you know for example blue dream when

2965
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,920
blue dream came around

2966
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,439
it was it was one cut

2967
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,960
right more or less like there ended up

2968
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:53,678
being a couple that were very similar

2969
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,158
but

2970
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,000
there was one cut and then people would

2971
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:59,439
come along and be like i got this blue

2972
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,039
dream santa cruz blue dream thing and

2973
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:03,919
then they'll like spank white widow on

2974
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:06,079
it or some og or whatever some random

2975
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,800
pollen yeah and then they sell the seeds

2976
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,880
as blue dreams blue dream and now people

2977
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,000
grow those seeds in a different market

2978
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,400
where they don't know what the original

2979
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,399
blue dream is they pick a mom they say

2980
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:17,519
it's blue dream and now you've got two

2981
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:19,279
plants

2982
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,719
that are being passed around the world

2983
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,238
as if they're both the original and one

2984
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,760
of them is not even the same chemical

2985
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:26,718
profile as the blue drink yeah right

2986
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,920
it's not even close most likely yeah

2987
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:29,279
so

2988
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,880
uh crab babies asking how much the

2989
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:32,719
ancestral skunk did we get to see a fair

2990
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,239
amount like we grow a chunk

2991
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:35,920
it's it's interesting i mean there's

2992
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:37,118
some stuff in there the ancestral the

2993
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:39,600
people i don't know people know about

2994
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:41,599
ancestral scots yeah talk about it those

2995
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:44,159
were seeds that dave when dave was

2996
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,600
moving over to holland uh in like early

2997
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:47,439
80s he brought obviously a bunch of

2998
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,800
stuff over he brought like a case of

2999
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:50,799
seeds over

3000
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,520
and you know did various things with him

3001
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,560
and didn't work with him various things

3002
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,239
he met a hemp researcher that that knew

3003
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,840
um

3004
01:40:58,238 --> 01:41:01,439
he met a hemp researcher that was

3005
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,039
essentially like

3006
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:04,559
he was a he was in a european country

3007
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:06,158
i'm not going to say which one

3008
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,239
but he was

3009
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:11,039
the he grew like he was known as the

3010
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:14,238
half guy right like redhead their their

3011
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:16,319
country sold hemp seed around the world

3012
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:17,279
and when

3013
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,679
when the

3014
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:21,840
uh police would like they'd come across

3015
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,279
a cannabis bust they'd go and get him

3016
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,679
and bring him to the site and be like is

3017
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:28,238
this drug cannabis or not is this hemp

3018
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,560
yeah right yeah i know black bar

3019
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:30,559
um

3020
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,840
and um

3021
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:37,279
sorry someone's asking that question

3022
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,279
that's all right and uh anyway

3023
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:43,599
sam arranged for this guy to grow on his

3024
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,399
research field a hectare of skunk

3025
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,800
yeah

3026
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:48,238
and and open populate it so essentially

3027
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,760
like you know sam brought those seeds

3028
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:51,599
over and they all went into greenhouses

3029
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,360
they did various things things with them

3030
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,600
had a big bunch of

3031
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:56,559
the skunk left enough to plant like a

3032
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,159
hectare

3033
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,119
and so they took them to this european

3034
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:00,799
company

3035
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:02,799
country and planted in hector in

3036
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,600
isolation

3037
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:07,039
and he and rob went through the

3038
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,480
uh what the field and rogued all the

3039
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:10,639
males and the off-types and the and the

3040
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,399
the females that were not skunk-like

3041
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:15,279
yeah but the rest of it just got like an

3042
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:17,359
open pocket open pollinated that is what

3043
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:20,238
the ancestral skunk is

3044
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:23,198
okay okay so it's like it's the closest

3045
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:26,079
thing a population could be

3046
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:28,559
to what was produced in california

3047
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:30,238
yes all the other families that came out

3048
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,840
of that population were like you know

3049
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:33,439
they were family lines somebody went in

3050
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,440
and found two plants and they crossed

3051
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:37,519
them together yeah so what came out of

3052
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,039
that from those one-to-one cross is not

3053
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,360
the same as what was preserved in the

3054
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:43,039
overall open population right so that's

3055
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:45,198
what the op that's what the skunk was as

3056
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:47,600
i said sam was like there's all these

3057
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:49,759
people are you know

3058
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,800
crying and whatever about having access

3059
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,560
to

3060
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,940
what's up plastagram

3061
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,320
um

3062
01:42:52,939 --> 01:42:56,158
[Music]

3063
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:57,679
let's give them access to this so we did

3064
01:42:56,158 --> 01:42:58,799
right and that and they have they got a

3065
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,800
low germination rate i mean they

3066
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,000
germinate yeah like that like 25 or

3067
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,440
maybe even a little bit less now i

3068
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,118
haven't tested them recently well

3069
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:06,079
they're pretty old right

3070
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:08,158
yeah i mean they must have been

3071
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,118
reproduced like

3072
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:11,599
30

3073
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:13,198
25 30 years ago yeah

3074
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,119
that's why

3075
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:16,319
a couple years ago

3076
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:18,559
sam was looking at selling his

3077
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:21,039
collection and i actually helped him

3078
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,800
re-catalog the entire thing

3079
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:24,639
and so we got to go you know we went

3080
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,000
through everything and

3081
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,679
we did a whole bunch of germination

3082
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,279
tests and we pulled stuff out that was

3083
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,960
like 25 year old seed that had been

3084
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,519
stored at like

3085
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,840
you know four degrees celsius for

3086
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,800
20 plus years 25 years and sometimes

3087
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,480
germinated at like 80 90

3088
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,400
so seeds if they're stored properly and

3089
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:44,158
consistently they can last a long time

3090
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:46,719
and it's like i got like i got a ton of

3091
01:43:44,158 --> 01:43:48,479
those blueberry seeds still left from

3092
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,319
from the dj projects and people like

3093
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:52,238
yeah but they're all seeds but dude i

3094
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:53,920
can pull [ __ ] the grapefruit sweet

3095
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:55,359
skunk out and pop 10 of them and i'll

3096
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,279
pan in them

3097
01:43:55,359 --> 01:44:00,719
right like doesn't matter how old the

3098
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:02,719
[ __ ] seed is if it germinates right

3099
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,399
yeah exactly

3100
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,439
obviously some people think differently

3101
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:06,960
but

3102
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:10,238
was there any skunk two in that

3103
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:12,319
population of uh stuff that he had saved

3104
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:13,839
skunk ii wasn't from sam

3105
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:15,198
oh it wasn't no you know where was that

3106
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,039
from i don't know somebody else came

3107
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:19,599
along and made it up i don't think he

3108
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:20,960
ever produced one called skunk too he um

3109
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,560
i remember there was some kind of quote

3110
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,880
somewhere about him talking about how

3111
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:27,280
skunk 2 was the

3112
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:29,118
the skunkier version

3113
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:30,079
he didn't work the skunkier version

3114
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:31,759
that's the thing he was like i don't

3115
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:32,840
like it i'm watching that

3116
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,280
yeah

3117
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,880
yeah i wonder where i read that i'll

3118
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,399
have to go back and look there's a lot

3119
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,440
of stuff that gets attributed to sam i

3120
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:41,118
mean it's like again the whole thing

3121
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,399
about him in the dea like all this [ __ ]

3122
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:44,639
is attributed to him that's just not

3123
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:46,479
even true there's little specks of like

3124
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:48,319
roots of truth

3125
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,479
somebody took and blew up into this big

3126
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:53,039
weird story and you know

3127
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:55,039
misinterpreted it um it's because he's

3128
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,800
mr mystery i think you know like he's

3129
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,560
like he's an enigma you're not wrong

3130
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,079
that doesn't help but again like i think

3131
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,440
after like i think if you were treated

3132
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,679
the way that he's been treated in the

3133
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:05,039
cannabis community

3134
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,800
look i mean it's like the same thing

3135
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,238
that happened with me in the my brain

3136
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,600
for that work that ended up being

3137
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:11,039
patented it's like everybody [ __ ]

3138
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:14,239
turns on you

3139
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:14,238
yeah right um

3140
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,960
and you know people like i said

3141
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:20,719
everywhere everywhere he went it was

3142
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,920
like the you know the whole dutch scene

3143
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:23,920
the reason that people started calling

3144
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,679
him dea

3145
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,600
was that he was able to come into a

3146
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,600
country that wasn't his he's not [ __ ]

3147
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,400
dutch he went to holland as an american

3148
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,840
expat

3149
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,799
and was able was able to get

3150
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,319
um

3151
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,239
no i didn't say rooting hormone i said

3152
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:39,920
hormones for plant tissue culture so

3153
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:42,158
rooting hormones not the same

3154
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,399
um some of the [ __ ] that they use for

3155
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:46,638
plant tissue culture can cause mutations

3156
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,799
but that's yeah

3157
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:50,960
um but anyway sam was able to go into

3158
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,320
holland set up set up business get a

3159
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,319
license to grow cannabis from the

3160
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,759
government nobody else could do it

3161
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:57,599
yeah and so of course all the dutch

3162
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,119
dudes were [ __ ] choked right they

3163
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,800
were like how is this not this isn't

3164
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:03,279
fair this guy's got all this [ __ ] right

3165
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,760
yeah absolutely he must have some

3166
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:08,079
context that we don't have what the [ __ ]

3167
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,000
like the dea is an american organization

3168
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:11,198
why the hell would the dea

3169
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,479
go to the government of a different

3170
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,238
country and say hey you got to let this

3171
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,479
america grow weed in your country that

3172
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:19,678
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense like

3173
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:21,519
that's a stupid [ __ ] assumption right

3174
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,600
that's the story that some dutch

3175
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,280
reporter guy came up with and he used to

3176
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,199
have a written cannabis radio show and

3177
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:29,679
he spared them all over the airwaves and

3178
01:46:27,198 --> 01:46:31,359
now it's [ __ ] true for half the world

3179
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:33,279
right wow is that where it came from is

3180

3181
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,880
well it started

3182
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:39,199
as a rumor but that's when it like got

3183
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,560
popularized yeah never never remember

3184

01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:32,638
and that's what my intentions are the

3211
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:35,039
[ __ ] company that i was working with

3212
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,600
at the time that i was employed by that

3213
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,760
were allowing me to [ __ ] like have my

3214
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,760
dream cannabis job and build a [ __ ]

3215
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,639
multi-million dollar laboratory to play

3216
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,440
in

3217
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:47,199
right like yeah it's a job but it's also

3218
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:48,799
a job that i wanted to do one of the

3219
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:50,879
consequences that these guys came out

3220
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,520
and patented a bunch of uh

3221
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,600
a

3222
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,360
a class of plants that didn't exist

3223
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,199
before i made them

3224
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:59,679
yeah so it's like how the hell people

3225
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:02,000
like you can complain

3226
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:04,239
is ridiculous like you you obviously

3227
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,479
have no idea what you're talking about

3228
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:08,479
and are spouting an opinion

3229
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:10,638
of like from a place of complete

3230
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:13,118
ignorance so like yeah i do have to

3231
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:15,279
laugh and the reason i'm emotional about

3232
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:17,359
it and i'm clearly irritated is because

3233
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:19,840
i [ __ ] got death threats from people

3234
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:22,238
like you yeah i know right yeah

3235
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,880

01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:26,638
after me right i did yeah

3237
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:28,639
yeah i didn't have the full i didn't

3238
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:31,359
have the full picture and no one did and

3239
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:33,279
that's that's the problem you know

3240
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:36,158
no one had the full picture we just went

3241
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:38,238
off of uh oh my god patent this guy's

3242
01:48:36,158 --> 01:48:41,198
[ __ ] with the man

3243
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:43,279
listen our community was bred to believe

3244
01:48:41,198 --> 01:48:45,359
that right yeah yeah they'd be very

3245
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:47,279
conspiratorial they're bad like dude i

3246
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:50,799
knew research scientists that worked at

3247
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:53,920
gw pharmaceuticals like doing petri dish

3248
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:56,000
work and experimental design and like

3249
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:58,399
these guys would have the same

3250
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,158
experiences that you and i would have

3251
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:02,879
taking care of mary's nephew with

3252
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:04,638
epilepsy down the street right they

3253
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,480
would have personal relationships with

3254
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,118
like these kids that couldn't get access

3255
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,359
to cannabis and they would come in

3256
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:13,279
and because of gw pharmaceuticals that

3257
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:14,880
was doing the work with cannabis they

3258
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:16,479
were allowed they were able to get

3259
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,359
access to the medicine they needed to

3260
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:21,359
change their life right so i like big

3261
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:22,639
pharma or not i can't [ __ ] have i

3262
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:25,118
don't have a problem with that like if

3263
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:28,000
you're helping people

3264
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:29,839
in like a context again they're

3265
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,920
operating in the context of prohibition

3266
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,360
where like these medicines can't get to

3267
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,399
the people i made a post today about

3268
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,000

3269
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:38,158
right yeah somebody's chirping me about

3270
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,880
marijuana like oh no it's made by in a

3271
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,479
laboratory dude a molecule as a molecule

3272
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,880
is a molecule like

3273
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:47,519
if you're [ __ ] starving for water you

3274
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:50,560
don't care whether that water was made

3275
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,599
from like burning fossil fuels or mixing

3276
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,080
hydrogen

3277
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,960
and oxygen in a laboratory or purifying

3278
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:58,880
it out of [ __ ] [ __ ] sewer water like

3279
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:01,920
once it comes out at the end and it's

3280
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:03,840
pure [ __ ] water it's water

3281
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,520
right so it's the same with thc and it's

3282
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,920
the same with cbd

3283
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,360
right like if those medicines can go to

3284
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,880
someone that can benefit from those

3285
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:12,000
medicines that they couldn't access

3286
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,760
otherwise

3287
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,479
why the hell do you have a problem with

3288
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,719
it

3289
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:18,399
right like yeah i don't get it

3290
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:19,679
right and i know that it comes because

3291
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:21,118
they're not in the place where it's like

3292
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,158
you feel like oh the government's not

3293
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:26,719
letting you you you do your art and and

3294
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:28,238
grow the crop that you want to grow you

3295
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:30,079
know what the result is dude go change

3296
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:31,039
the laws and like we've been fighting

3297
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:34,559
for that

3298
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:36,158
hard for [ __ ] 30 40 plus years

3299
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,119
right but i've been involved for 30

3300
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:39,359
years

3301
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:41,198
right and um

3302
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:43,039

3303
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:45,039
was a farming member of the the

3304
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:46,399
the federal marijuana party in canada

3305
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:47,439

3306
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:49,679
cool like

3307
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:51,279
to effectuate change so it's like i get

3308
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,960
that you're pissed off

3309
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:55,279
and you're scared of big pharma but you

3310
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,560
have to [ __ ] direct that anger in a

3311
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:58,158
channel that's going to change things

3312
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,840
not just sit there and [ __ ] about big

3313
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:02,000
business because it's boring

3314
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,520
right it's like it's boring

3315
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,800
and big business is going to happen

3316
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:06,320
whether we like it or not we're seeing

3317
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:08,880
that in the cannabis world regardless

3318
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:10,960
it's going to happen it happens i want

3319
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,039
to change cannabis in the few years that

3320
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,439
i have left on this [ __ ] floating

3321
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:17,599
rock okay yeah so if you think i'm not

3322

3324
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:22,319
multi-million dollar budget to [ __ ]

okay yeah you don't like it too [ __ ]

3328
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:29,839
bad

3329
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:29,840
yeah right

3330
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,079
i like seeing the passionate side yeah

3331
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:35,519
like i mean i get offended by it right

3332
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:36,479
because it's like oh yeah of course you

3333
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,080
have people that don't know what the

3334
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,319
hell they're talking about

3335
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:43,359
and it's like they're spouting that off

3336
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,960
as if their ignorant perspective

3337
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:48,079
is like

3338
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:49,439
like one valuable but like too supremely

3339
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:51,439
valuable like they think that they're

3340
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:53,519
right it's like dude yeah go look up the

3341
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,519
dunning-kruger effect okay

3342
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,960
yeah yeah you know a little bit you know

3343
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:59,679
a little bit and think that you know

3344
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:01,679
everything right try learning a lot and

3345
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,279
then things like you know you know

3346
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,960
anyway whatever there's too much of that

3347
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,960
in the cannabis industry and you know

3348
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,719
i'm i'm all up for raising everybody up

3349
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,158
i would love to

3350
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:11,679
and that's why we do these things we

3351
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:14,000
share perspective we teach people

3352
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:15,760
because we want you all to be better so

3353
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
that you all can go and raise the

3354
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:20,079
[ __ ] game and when we all raise the

3355
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
game the cannabis is better the products

3356
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,439
are better the products are safer and

3357
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,198
we're all dabbing out on the dankest

3358
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:26,719
[ __ ] [ __ ] right like that's what

3359
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:31,039
exactly

3360
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:33,840
that's why i i i find it a an honor when

3361
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:35,439
anybody anybody uses my stuff

3362
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,800
because it means that it was good enough

3363
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:38,799
in their eyes

3364
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,239
to take forward and make better and and

3365
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,840
the resulting factor that is if they

3366
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:43,198
make something better than i made i

3367
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,960
don't let that intimidate me i want to

3368
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:46,879
go work with that like that's what and

3369
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,719
that's exciting they truly are making it

3370
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,159
better but the thing i don't like is

3371
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,359
when people like they actually hack

3372
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:52,960
apart your work and then they tell

3373
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,598
everybody it's better it's like and then

3374
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,679
they sell it as whatever your strain is

3375
01:52:55,599 --> 01:53:00,000
and then that's that i did today contact

3376
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,679
and he's like hey man i want like uh i'm

3377
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,960
interested in this kind of high and i'm

3378
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,800
looking at your

3379
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,319

seeds i was like oh you only buy a

3383
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:12,000
hundred seeds i'm not excited because

3384
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:13,760

3385
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,840
like yeah because he wants to pop a

3386
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,760
bunch i want him it was like it's like

3387
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:20,560
dude if you're gonna put in 100 grow

3388
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:22,800
effort or 100 seed effort into

3389
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,800
improving the line let me help you right

3390
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,920
yeah and it's like i would die this line

3391
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,599
and i would you know and i'm going to

3392
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,639
throw in this line extra so that you've

3393
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,639
got it

3394
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:32,159
so that as you're in breeding this one

3395
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,920
you should put a little bit of this back

3396
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:36,158
into it so that you know

3397
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:38,079
you don't you don't suffer inbreeding

3398
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:39,519
depression and they've got the same

3399
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:40,399
traits and it's got some nice flavor

3400
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,760
stuff so

3401
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:42,638
you know in the end you'll be you'll be

3402
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,639
able to

3403
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:47,359

lot of work to create that population

3409
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:00,559
and now you've essentially put it

3410
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:02,399
through bottleneck and you're selling at

3411

01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,920
i don't i don't i know i don't have the

3441
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:55,199
ability to do something with them can

3442
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,118
you please give them something that did

3443
01:54:55,198 --> 01:55:00,559
so we got some and i grew a whole bunch

3444
01:54:57,118 --> 01:55:02,719
and found a really interesting plan

3445
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,159
yeah and i put well i had one i was like

3446
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:06,560
i'm gonna take this one plant and put it

3447
01:55:04,158 --> 01:55:08,319
in the flowering room

3448
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,880
and it was you know it was like a real

3449
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:12,158
equatorial right so yeah you put it in

3450
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,520
it gets to like a foot tall and you're

3451
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,359
like oh this thing is going to really

3452
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,719
stretch so you cut it down and make four

3453
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:18,479
or four shoots

3454
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,239
and yeah this thing dude it was like

3455
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:21,519
twice as tall and wide as any other

3456
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:22,638
plant in the room and it must have

3457
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,239
produced like

3458
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,679
i don't know it wasn't they were in like

3459
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:29,198
the many thousands of these like it was

3460
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:30,960
like you know probably i bet

3461
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:33,598
because the whole thing just like the

3462
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:36,319
whole it was these long

3463
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:38,560
you know the old kind of like long spear

3464
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:40,639
flowers that you'd see in the 70s not

3465
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,400
too thick but like really yeah long

3466
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,159
running

3467
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:45,759
it was like that just chopped full of

3468
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:48,479
seeds

3469
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:51,039
uh it had a nice high effect it was like

3470
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:52,718
i we weren't analyzing turps back then

3471
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:55,359
but i in memory i would say that it's

3472
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,760
probably like a lyman interpreter lyman

3473
01:55:55,359 --> 01:56:00,399
pining plant which is interesting it's

3474
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:02,079
kind of rare in today's profile world

3475
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:04,799
yeah i think that's what was really

3476
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:06,880
associated with a lot of the old hazes

3477
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,520
and interesting

3478
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:11,279
it was just nice but it was nice classic

3479
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:13,599
non

3480
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:16,559
like it was not popular but so when i

3481
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:19,199
released those dj joint projects

3482
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,480
yeah i put some of those out there

3483
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:23,439
and i don't think we sold a pack for

3484
01:56:20,479 --> 01:56:24,638
like 18 months

3485
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:25,839
because they were like oh you know

3486
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:27,599
everybody wanted the grapefruit

3487
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,279
blueberry and the mental floss and all

3488
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:30,480
the the plants that were like

3489
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:32,319
getting yield

3490
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:34,079
and then finally somebody decided to

3491
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,599
grow a couple of those like in an

3492
01:56:34,079 --> 01:56:37,039
equatorial climate and ordered some of

3493
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:38,880
those and grew them

3494
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:40,560
and they were just

3495
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:43,679
i mean they're

3496
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:46,000
they have the ugliest phenotype flower

3497
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:49,679
female oh i'm sure yeah

3498
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:51,439
like long spindly weird like

3499
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:53,359
you know like buds that have like they

3500
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:54,799
look like they've got like five or six

3501
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:56,399
fox tails coming out of them just two

3502
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,520
calories

3503
01:56:56,399 --> 01:56:59,198
right and they'd look it would look like

3504
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,719
a finger it wouldn't look like a hand

3505
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:01,919
with a bunch of things i remember seeing

3506
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,000
them yeah

3507
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,679
yeah and you could take them like just

3508
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,920
rip off calyx and essentially fold the

3509
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:11,039
paper around that right

3510
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:13,359
right but it was a great nice effect

3511
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:15,760
um in doing those crosses and actually

3512
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:17,198
growing dj stuff i

3513
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:19,199
i don't i'm not

3514
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:21,598
i don't have proof that this is the way

3515
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:22,559
it is but it's definitely my very strong

3516
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:27,199
feeling

3517
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:27,199
is that all those introspective and like

3518
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:31,440
i don't say uh but like

3519
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:33,760
cerebral kind of highs that you get from

3520
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:35,359
thc and this is largely from running all

3521
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,880
dj stuff through that really expensive

3522
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:38,399
lab that we built

3523
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:40,000
like in population

3524
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:40,879
most of it's in the 8 to 12 percent

3525
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,840
range

3526
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,840
yeah right it's not [ __ ] 25 but

3527
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,279
yeah exactly low cannabinoid production

3528
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,639
what we would call today low can have a

3529
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:49,840
life correction plan

3530
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:53,440
yeah but

3531
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:55,119
when you whack up 30 to like 28 25 28 30

3532
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:57,198
percent thc

3533
01:57:55,118 --> 01:58:00,158
you start to really get that stoned kind

3534
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:01,759
of lethargic kind of dull effect where

3535
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:04,399
it's like

3536
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,760
all the sheen has been taken off of like

3537
01:58:04,399 --> 01:58:07,359
a high and you just kind of feel it in

3538
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:09,599
your head and you're just

3539
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:11,039
like kind of whacked and stoned that's

3540
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,800
yeah dhc

3541
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,198
right and if you take a marinol pill you

3542
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,800
actually feel the same way i bet right

3543
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:19,279
it kind of feels like somebody flooded

3544
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,800
you in the head with something you know

3545
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:21,679
like wacky yeah

3546
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,840
um

3547
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:25,520
and you don't get that from

3548
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,279
those 12 percenters or those 10

3549
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:29,520
percenters now you can kind of get a

3550
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:31,679
nice floaty buzz but it's like it's

3551
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,320
enough that you're affected but you're

3552
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:37,039
just kind of in a different headspace

3553
01:58:34,319 --> 01:58:38,880
and yeah i i think they're headed high

3554
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:41,920
well and for you know like the folks in

3555
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:44,000
rob's generation dave's generation

3556
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,520
that's i'm not saying rob and dave in

3557
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,679
particular but like

3558
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:49,199
people of that age that's what cannabis

3559
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:51,840
was when they were growing up and what

3560
01:58:49,198 --> 01:58:53,439
they had access to right that was like

3561
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:56,000
he didn't come across like a cookies

3562
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:57,279
back in the 70s it didn't exist no no of

3563
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,560
course now

3564
01:58:57,279 --> 01:59:00,000
so

3565
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,639
um

3566
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,238
you'd be but you'd be buzzed right but

3567
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:05,440
it's a different headspace and so that

3568
01:59:04,238 --> 01:59:07,039
whole generation not that whole

3569
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:09,198
generation but the majority of that

3570
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:11,599
generation fell in love with that

3571
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:13,919
experience and then sure

3572
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:15,279
indica and 20 plus percent cannabis came

3573
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,359
along it was too much for them because

3574
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:18,479
it didn't do that same thing that they

3575
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:20,399
wanted

3576
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:21,839
right and i you know when someone was

3577
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:24,000
talking about when the basket's full

3578
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,520
stuff with thca

3579
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,079
you're you're kind of right but it's

3580
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,599
like you know dj for example like music

3581
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:30,399
with lsd

3582
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:31,760
right

3583
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:33,920
and so

3584
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,520
maybe the basket's not full with you

3585
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,199
don't want to fill the basket with thc

3586
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,239
because when you're putting lsd and thc

3587
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:39,678
in it together

3588
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:42,079
in moderate amounts like it's a more

3589
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:44,719
pleasant effect at least for him

3590
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:46,639
yeah this is all about perception so

3591
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:49,439
um

3592
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,800
it's just you know i it's an interesting

3593
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:52,000
thing because essentially what's

3594
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:55,039
happened now

3595
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:57,439
is that like market with a 10 or a 12

3596
01:59:55,039 --> 02:00:00,000
flower good [ __ ] luck

3597
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:01,439
yeah the market consumers retailers

3598
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,920
distributors are all going to laugh at

3599
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:05,759
you yeah totally arguably there's a

3600
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,199
whole class of people out there

3601
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,280
that would like that

3602
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:10,799
oh for sure right for sure it's kind of

3603
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:12,000
like saying hey we're gonna have liquor

3604
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:14,000
stores we're only gonna sell things that

3605
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,158
are like 25 and above percent alcohol it

3606
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,118
gets rid of all beer all wine

3607
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:18,879
all

3608
02:00:17,118 --> 02:00:20,639
you know like coolers and all that kind

3609
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,800
of stuff that's a huge amount of like

3610
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:24,400
alcohol consumers or the people that

3611
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,760
like those products that they don't want

3612
02:00:24,399 --> 02:00:27,839
to sit down with a bottle of whiskey and

3613

so in a way

3616
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:34,719
we're doing the market in the service

3617
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:37,118
and we're doing consumers uh the service

3618

i just don't i like to be able to if i

3630
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:01,598
have to react to something i want to be

3631
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,840
able to react as fast as possible you

3632
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:05,199

3633
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,400
yeah

3634
02:01:05,198 --> 02:01:08,000
yeah well people are saying it's like

3635
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:09,920
you know every not everybody wants that

3636
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,560
some people don't want older weed older

3637
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,880
people usually and it's true

3638
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:16,400
but maybe like you know we could teach

3639
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:19,359
people how to use cannabis in a way that

3640
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:22,960
some people might not want

3641
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:25,519
uh like even if you're a teenager right

3642
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,118
and dude i've seen it with friends like

3643
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,400
i've seen them friends that like they

3644
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:29,598
start smoking a little weed and then

3645
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:31,679
they're like yeah it's fun and then they

3646
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:33,440
get into it and they start smoking more

3647
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,239
and they're [ __ ] way too bad right

3648
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:36,399
and it

3649
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:38,079
doesn't like it impacts their life in a

3650
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:40,879
negative way

3651
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:42,559
yeah right so and so i want more people

3652
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:44,079
using cannabis

3653
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,639
if they got to smoke something that's

3654
02:01:44,079 --> 02:01:48,158
like you know half cbd and half thc or

3655
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:51,039
even just mostly with a little bit of

3656
02:01:48,158 --> 02:01:52,879
thc in it like you know five percent tfc

3657
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:54,560
i don't care like i think that we should

3658
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,800
make cannabis for all people

3659
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:59,199
um i do too market when we've got the

3660
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,679
market that is this way it just it's not

3661
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:03,439
a good thing for the for it's not a good

3662
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,679
thing for consumers

3663
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:07,759
you know there there are

3664
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:09,760
scientific studies that show like mass

3665
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:11,360
consumption of thc for at least some

3666
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,039
people is not a good thing

3667
02:02:11,359 --> 02:02:14,319
yeah and so what do we say oh sorry you

3668
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:15,599
guys you don't get to just you just

3669
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:16,880
you're not allowed to benefit from this

3670
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,400
plan

3671
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,920
yeah

3672
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,319
right it's like well hey how about i can

3673
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,920
make you something that does matter

3674
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:26,238
about a variety that i developed out of

3675
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,599
napro for the with the beta carotene and

3676
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:29,839
the cbdv

3677
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,960
right it was like i was like

3678
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:35,920
that plant had no recreational potential

3679
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:37,840
at all like it was not fun for anybody

3680
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:40,719
right but it was going to make a

3681
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,520
difference in some three-year-old's life

3682
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:43,118
right

3683
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,400
and his mom isn't going to be able to

3684
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:46,319
like give him this [ __ ] and he's not

3685
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:48,719
going to have like 10 seizures a day

3686
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:50,639
that felt really [ __ ] good dude right

3687
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,239
being able to make that plant it felt

3688
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:53,118
really really really good like i can't

3689
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:55,118
tell you

3690
02:02:53,118 --> 02:02:57,439
the way i can imagine i was more proud

3691
02:02:55,118 --> 02:03:00,000
of that plant in a way

3692
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:02,079
than any high thc plant that i've ever

3693
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,238
made that like has like a thousand more

3694
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:06,079
people using it or yeah like 10 000

3695
02:03:04,238 --> 02:03:07,118

of cannabis for all types of people

3699

02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:16,238
like the majority of people doesn't like

3701

even with all the stuff around that was

3734
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:19,599
popular in the market but i mean i grew

3735
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,360
some of that [ __ ] out recently it's

3736
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:22,400
every bit as good as a lot of the other

3737
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:24,000
stuff

3738
02:04:22,399 --> 02:04:24,799
i could give a [ __ ] about the market i

3739
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,479
mean

3740
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,320
especially right now i mean the the seed

3741
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:30,399
markets crashed uh cannabis markets

3742
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:31,679
crashed like right now the people that

3743
02:04:30,399 --> 02:04:32,719
are gonna stick through it are the

3744
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:33,679
people that were always gonna stick

3745
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:35,760
through it whether they were making

3746
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:37,279
money or not so

3747
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:39,440
i'm looking forward to that at least

3748
02:04:37,279 --> 02:04:40,559
shaking out some of the [ __ ] [ __ ] and

3749
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:42,078
that's about all the good that's gonna

3750
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,679
come from it but well i gotta leave

3751
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:45,759
something that dave said you know dave

3752
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:47,679
watson sam says it's like we all stand

3753
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:48,719
on the shoulders of giants

3754
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:50,719
right

3755
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:52,239
um all of us everybody that works with

3756
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:54,078
cannabis we all got those seeds from

3757
02:04:52,238 --> 02:04:55,759
somewhere except for greatest people he

3758
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,519
invited cannabis so

3759
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,520
that's the difference

3760
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:02,320
yeah we got to respect the people that

3761
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:04,320
we got things from and you know

3762
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:06,880
all all of us in our germ pleasant that

3763
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:07,920

02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:11,599
right and sure maybe maybe we refined it

3766
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:13,359
a little bit maybe we found some better

3767
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:14,239
plants and we propagated and changed

3768
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:15,759
around

3769
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:17,759
