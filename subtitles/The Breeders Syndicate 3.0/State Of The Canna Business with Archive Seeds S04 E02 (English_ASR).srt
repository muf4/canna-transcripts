so

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,079
we are gonna chat

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,320
today about a pretty wide topic but

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,959
people have been asking a lot about it

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,359
um which is sort of like the the whole

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,199
like hash plant topic

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,359
right because it's meant different

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
things at different times

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,640
and there's a lot of old famous hash

41
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,359
plants

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,359
yeah

43
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,280
and there's a lot of breeding that got

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,799
bred into those

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
and then there's a lot of new modern

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,118
ones yeah a new modern plants for hash

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,200
yeah i mean not only not and by modern i

48
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,319
mean like even like you know there was a

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,118
whole new round of named cuts

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,279
that oh yeah they got you know hash

51
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,879
plant labels or yeah

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
different things and now hash plan

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,399
actually means

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
you know something totally different

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
sure it does

56
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,919
you know um so yeah we're going to kind

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,078
of talk widely about hash plants so if

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,079
you ever have any hash blank questions

59
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,799
or anything along those lines today is a

60
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,840
great day to shoot them uh and see

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
what's up

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
i got all the i got all the catalogs

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,599
ready i've got

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,719
illustrations ready of said hash plants

65
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,000
most of them

66
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,359
and i even went back and um because

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
there was one hash plan i thought of

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,520
that nobody ever really mentions anymore

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,560
but for a while in the

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,640
like the 0809 era it was pretty popular

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
and that was the cuttlefish so i even

72
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,958
dug up info on the old cuttlefish plant

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,000
the old cuttlefish so yeah we're going

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,598
to go over as many as we can remember

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,479
as many of this week so yeah we're going

76
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,679
to talk about the history of hash plant

77
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,199
we're going to talk about a bunch of

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,439
specific cuts

79
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,958
people can ask away about specific cuts

80
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,719
they're interested in like like matt

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,439
just said he's got a list

82
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,680
um but like maybe uh

83
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
um the term hash plant

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,480
you know just to start

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:07,519
right is kind of a weird term

86
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:10,079
uh because uh all afghans back then

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,120
were pretty much bred and grown for hash

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,519
yes

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,360
but then some strains got called hash

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
plant and some strains got called other

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
names

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,959
and do we know that was neville the

93
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,119
first one to name a strain or did it

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
come over that way with that name and

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,799
then he used the name

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,120
i mean i don't know you know the only

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,239
thing that we know about like the g13

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
and the uh pnw hash plant is that

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,039
neville says he bought him an organ

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,598
through friends of jorge cervantes yeah

101
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,679
yeah and jorge confirmed that you know

102
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,798
yeah um but we don't know the origin

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
stories

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,640
so i assume he just called it what he

105
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,878
got it it was a hash plan

106
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,199
yeah i i assume so too i don't know

107
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,039
where it where the name evolved would be

108
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,798
nice to ask jorge but i don't know if he

109
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,878
would know but it's weird because it's

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,640
like essentially like hash plants

111
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,560
started off as basically being any

112
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,199
any afghan

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,400
yes because they were all that's what

114
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,958
that's what

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,719
you know marijuana was grown for yeah

116
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
was to make hatch

117
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,919
and so people started bringing over all

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,839
these afghans or hash plants or whatever

119
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,439
all these various different things over

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,719
to america

121
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,240
and you know we talked about this a

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,280
bunch but crossing them with a bunch of

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,439
different sativas yeah

124
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,119
right yep

125
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,879
is is kind of that's kind of that's kind

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
of the beginning of it

127
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,439
right

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
yes so here's

129
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,719
this is

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,478
i could probably jump the gun on showing

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,840
this one actually let's go ahead quick

132
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,319
i mean that's not it's not terribly

133
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,000
jumping the gun so what happened is is

134
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,599
that a bunch of people started bringing

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,519
over these afghans because they wanted

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
to add bigger chunkier buds to their

137
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,039
sativas and they wanted their sativas to

138
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,959
finish earlier right yeah so

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
um afghanistan is a super different

140
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,039
climate than over here so most of these

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
hash plants or afghans that they brought

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,160
over they just rot it

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
yeah

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,600
they just they just read in terrible rot

145
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
uh so the vast majority

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,800
of the seeds that people brought over

147
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,959
ended up being not that useful yeah like

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
people would go and get their sativa

149
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,120
seeds from before they bred that indica

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,439
into it

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
right and so there so early on

152
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,800
um

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,879
early on the big hunt for hash plants or

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,639
the big hunt for

155
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,759
afghans was ones that didn't rot

156
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,600
yeah and that's kind of why i think some

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,759
of these cuttings became so popular

158
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
like you know because most you know most

159
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,840
of the breeding that got done just got

160
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
done with specific mops

161
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,198
yeah because once you found one that did

162
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,600
that you traded it

163
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,840
right yep that's how they did over there

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
that's how they did it so so there's an

165
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,839
aspect where it's like neville went and

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
you know neville even said that like

167
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,879
because matt held up his his catalog or

168
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,198
whatever

169
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,918
all that hunting that neville did in

170
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,240
afghanistan he said regrettably like

171
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,318
those those afghans weren't as nice as

172
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,879
some of the clone onlys he got sent over

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,759
from america yeah whether that was big

174
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,079
bud or the pacific northwest hash plant

175
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,280
or the g13 or

176
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,359
you know

177
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,038
some of the cuttings that he got and so

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
these cuttings that did well you know

179
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,560
the nl5 all these different things start

180
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,959
getting passed around

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
yeah because they work

182
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,478
right and so neville probably would met

183
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,639
with matt just held up neville probably

184
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,839
made it really famous this is the hash

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,720
plant pure

186
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,799
by

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,919
he crossed the hash plant to like the

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,038
g13 and the and the nl1

189
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,439
and he and then he took a g13 nl1 and he

190
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,879
back crossed it to the hash plan again

191
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,680
and that's what matt was showing that

192
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,918
ugly squat thing hash plant pure yeah

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,519
this is the hashtag here which i mean

194
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,560
you know there is debate on whether the

195
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,680
pnw hash plant that exists today is

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
this

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,240
but looking at this and granted

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
you know different growing environments

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,400
everything else i i would be

200
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,840
hard-pressed to say this looks anything

201
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:16,879
like the the cut indoors grown here

202
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,879
uh of the pnw it doesn't it looks like

203
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,680
[Music]

204
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,318
that gets passed around either but boy

205
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,959
does it look like some ugly puck it sure

206
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,439
does it's bud formation and and all that

207
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,439
type of stuff and so what's weird maybe

208
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,478
i should say this before we move on

209
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,439
what's weird about what we did right

210
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,879
is

211
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,800
um

212
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,918
someone just asked so afghan is hash

213
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
plant now

214
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,399
the afghan people

215
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,359
grew

216
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,758
afghans to make into hashish

217
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
yes you know they that they made hash

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,240
they still make hash they don't smoke

219
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,079
flour so they never called it hash

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
plants

221
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,399
right like it was it was just a term

222
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
that got put on to afghans and then

223
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,598
people think it made it meant something

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
specific

225
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,759
but all afghan and pakistani stuff

226
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,120
that's what they did

227
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
with their plants yeah you make hash

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,680
you know

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
and so

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,800
um you know and and so there's an aspect

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,639
where we brought all these plants over

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
to america

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,840
okay and started [ __ ] with them

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,319
whether they're steve murphy's afghan

235
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,038
that started the nl thing or the you

236
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,840
know or the the pacific northwest hash

237
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:35,120
plan or the big bud story or whatever

238
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,679
but we weren't using them for hash plans

239
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
we weren't growing fields like they were

240
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,158
and doing anything that they were doing

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
yeah right so what we did we were

242
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,838
looking for them to blend well with our

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
sativas

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,880
yeah right now that's a trip right

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,360
because that means that right when they

246
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,439
got to america a completely different

247
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,080
set of selection pressures got put into

248
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,320
play yeah they yeah i mean they were

249
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
they were selecting and for breeding

250
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,240
they came over here they they had been

251
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,599
selected to work well in the afghanistan

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,959
environment

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,720
to make to make those people hash

254
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,479
and we brought it over here and tried to

255
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,360
blend it with our favorite weed to get

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,360
good weed to smoke

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,080
right and and to finish early indoors

258
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,600
sure yeah but i mean

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,800
all these different like they weren't

260
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
trying to they weren't there was no

261
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,240
indoor

262
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,360
i mean we used afghans for indoor when

263
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
they came over yeah but no they from

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,120
afghanistan or pakistan or that region

265
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,120
they were always growing outside oh yeah

266
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,278
yeah they weren't blowing up houses and

267
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
no and they didn't they came from a cold

268
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,360
dry environment so they weren't worried

269
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,039
about the mold i'm just saying that like

270
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
all of the farmers

271
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,278
looking for

272
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,399
for you know uh you know genetics you

273
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:51,039
know various aspects that um benefit an

274
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,600
afghanistan farmer was much different

275
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,000
than a washington oregon california

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
indoor or outdoor grower trying to [ __ ]

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,759
with some mexicans

278
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,320
and some colombians and some panamanians

279
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,319
and some thai and blend this afghan into

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
that and get what they want

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
we had a way different set of selection

282
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,959
pressure and we didn't really make hash

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
for a long time except for for private

284
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,359
yeah

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
right

286
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,839
yep

287
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,958
so

288
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,720
you know

289
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,039
but we liked they were short they were

290
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
squat um they were they had a bunch of

291
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,199
crystal

292
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,600
you know and were visual creatures too

293
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,920
so frosty looking nugs

294
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,519
work better for americans

295
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,199
you know and so what were the what were

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
the famous what are the famous earliest

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
hash plans

298
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,879
so the early ones i mean as far as the

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,470
earliest we're going to go you know like

300
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,558
uh

301
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,559
[Music]

302
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,120
i mean the pnw

303
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,799
there weren't a lot of early early hash

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
points but some of the the ones early in

305
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,639
the scene would be like you know there

306
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,359
was the seed bank cash plant which would

307
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,958
be

308
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,240
their hash plant pure which would be

309
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,719
different from

310
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,959
you know the g13 or the the hash plant

311
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
nl1 which was using the g13 hash plant

312
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,599
no one

313
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,159
we have the puck

314
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,920
of course aka skelly we have the

315
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,240
cuttlefish hash plant

316
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,919
uh bce hash plant there was also a

317
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,079
champagne hash plant which i'm not sure

318
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,679
if is different from the bc hash plant

319
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,879
maybe some of the canadian folks will

320
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,439
know uh we have hash plant 13

321
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,439
um yeah and some of these some of these

322
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
aren't even necessarily from the hash

323
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,959
plant family

324
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,958
of strains that came from neville you

325
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,439
know some of these were just called hash

326
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,000
plant because of whatever reason

327
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
it became a bit hash plan is a bit like

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,799
kush

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,078
in that it's a general term that applies

330
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,240
to a wide variety of things yeah

331
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,919
you know and why one thing was all

332
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,919
labeled kush and another thing was

333
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,078
labeled hash plant when the kush was

334
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,759
destined to be made into hash

335
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,359
yeah it's just one of those language

336
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,000
things that happened

337
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,320
yeah and there's there is some confusion

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,399
uh i guess we can go into individual

339
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
ones in a little bit so if you want to

340
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,360
continue

341
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,278
i don't want to jump it

342
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,800
no i mean so that's basically like and

343
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:13,360
then it became famous because in the 80s

344
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,439
as as he just showed uh neville started

345
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,800
calling things hash plan

346
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,800
and there was famous hash plant hybrids

347
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,719
you know and mostly americans used it

348
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,838
because it was a short squat decent

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,360
yielding frosty plant inside yeah we

350
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
weren't you know nobody was really

351
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
making hash in america we smoked flour

352
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
mostly

353
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,078
yeah okay

354
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
champagne was different from the bc very

355
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,359
interesting

356
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,399
good to know

357
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
and it's actually interesting maybe if

358
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,120
you were going to jump around but i'm

359
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,120
going to really jump around to like

360
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,200
today okay so

361
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,039
when when we first brought over all

362
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
these hash plants they were brought over

363
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,799
and they had been bred to be excellent

364
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,879
hash plants yeah right and people like

365
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,559
uh people in europe and and in the know

366
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,559
and yo sami and stuff have told me that

367
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,799
they feel like a lot of modern cultivars

368
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,479
like a really shitty hash plants yeah

369
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,039
that a lot of the traditional ones that

370
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,560
were bred for that specifically and bred

371
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,120
for resin

372
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,039
are much better plants for that

373
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,120
yeah because they were never bred for

374
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,439
anything else yeah and now with the

375
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,879
legalization and all that and the hash

376
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
revolution that's happened with all

377
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,039
these various elements and dabs and

378
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,039
everything we're actually like looking

379
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,199
people talk about dumpers

380
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,519
yeah right they talk about hash yield a

381
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
lot in various ways and methods and so

382
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,799
figuring out what plants are good hash

383
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,200
plants is like back in vogue yeah kind

384
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,120
of for the first time ever yeah

385
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,120
like on on any kind of like commercial

386
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
scale people have been making hash here

387
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,600
privately to share with their friends

388
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,838
forever yeah but as far as like uh like

389
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,079
a major thing it's probably it's pretty

390
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
recent last 20 years probably yeah

391
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,078
easily and now with testing and people

392
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
can be like oh this thing washes six

393
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,198
percent or this thing washes this people

394
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,519
start hunting for hash plant yields

395
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,838
yeah and and what is a good washer what

396
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,278
what keeps its flavor

397
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,160
but we went 40 [ __ ] years

398
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,320
without those pressures being applied

399
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,159
this is this is a good input from

400
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
archive he said dumpers are mainly just

401
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,078
plants with higher than average thc to

402
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,440
terp ratio

403
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,039
yeah that's good

404
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
good info so

405
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,159
you know so there's an aspect where it's

406
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,320
like for a long time from what most

407
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,039
people is hash plants came over here and

408
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,440
got mixed with other weed

409
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,039
you know for breeding purposes

410
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
you know because like if you look at the

411
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,799
puck or you look at that picture

412
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,120
you know some of those things were short

413
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,078
squat ugly

414
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,078
you know they weren't the most

415
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,958
attractive things always

416
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,039
yeah even even chem 91 uh you know aside

417
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,119
from hash plants cam 91 is another

418
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,278
afghani not necessarily known for its

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,959
beautiful qualities same kind of way

420
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,120
yeah same kind of way

421
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,879
yeah so but they started becoming famous

422
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,679
because he put him in the first

423
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,958
catalogue yeah and so there was hash

424
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,879
plants and then you know like he was

425
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,879
saying the skelly there's some that

426
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,198
survived from back then that became got

427
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,159
really well known yeah

428
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,198
um but they're not related

429
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,879
to enough

430
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,879
not a lot

431
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,879
just see someone's asking me to show the

432
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,519
uh hash plant pure again so i'm going to

433
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,519
show that again

434
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,198
there we go

435
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
so the hash plant pure

436
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,159
neville took the hash plant clone only

437
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,920
he got from oregon he crossed it to a

438
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,159
male nl1

439
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,159
and then he took a male of that hybrid

440
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,360
and crossed it back

441
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,198
to the

442
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,278
to the hash plant

443
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,879
and that was his hash plant pure yeah

444
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,480
and that's honestly kind of like what he

445
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,198
did with a number of things like when he

446
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,720
offered his hawaiian indica um there's a

447
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,639
number of things where he crossed it

448
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,199
once to nl1

449
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,120
and then crossed a male of that hybrid

450
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,599
back to itself and just released it as a

451
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,480
pure line yeah that was actually a

452
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
reasonably common tactic

453
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
it makes sense yeah

454
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
it does appear that neville got the hash

455
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,079
plant and the g13 on the same trip at

456
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,199
the same time from the same people even

457
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,439
how would you have liked to have been

458
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,439
able to grab a pack of that

459
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,320
the original afghan mix

460
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,519
neville sold uh neville sold

461
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,920
seeds that uh jim ortega had given him

462
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,600
yeah he got so many that he he offered

463
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,078
up the same seeds that he found all of

464
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,480
the maple leaf stuff in he sold for a

465
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,159
couple years as just 50 pack 50 pack

466
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,278
breeder packs and 150 bucks

467
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,399
yeah

468
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,679
yeah

469
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,278
unreal

470
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,278
neville was cool in that sense and that

471
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,439
he pretty much just told you what he was

472
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,799
crossing there was no real secrecy

473
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,160
behind it

474
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,958
you know uh but he was also first

475
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:53,198
so he didn't have to hide anything yeah

476
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,239
that helps

477
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,240
um

478
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,079
but yeah you know the these hash plans

479
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,879
some of these hash plants have gotten

480
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,679
famous it's very likely that the

481
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,600
puck

482
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,639
is a direct descendant of that picture

483
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
matt

484
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
you know that's the rumor at least that

485
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
it's seeds from then

486
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,439
and then uh

487
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,480
um our buddy bodhi has a pretty famous

488
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
a lot number of lines out that him and

489
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,078
other people have used matt got some of

490
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,640
those from ndn guy yeah uh the g13 hash

491
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,198
plant which was 1988.

492
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
the 88 g13 yeah i mean that's that's

493
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,840
kind of how they how they type it or

494
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,919
whatever but

495
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,599
um it's basically supposed to be from

496
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,038
the first year that neville released the

497
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,240
g13

498
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,919
hash plant hybrid yeah yeah

499
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,480
right yeah

500
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,559
i mean i i who knows what what they were

501
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
really from or what year or which seed

502
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,480
bank or any of that but that was the

503
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,160
story given with them

504
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,720
1988 cincy seeds plant was or g13 hash

505
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,440
plan which was what they said

506
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,759
so whatever it is i mean it's it it that

507
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,519
exists and so a lot of people have that

508
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,679
and people have puck hybrids and some

509
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,200
people still have the puck clone yeah

510
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,880
you know and so there's some old hash

511
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,919
plants that exist but

512
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
um

513
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,038
you can kind of cons like and then there

514
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,798
was kind of like another wave

515
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,919
where people started kept using the

516
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,720
nickname

517
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,120
yes

518
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,640
but they it was all grown for flower

519
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,399
yeah

520
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
in my in my opinion nobody was really

521
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
making

522
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,199
nobody was really using it the way they

523
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,600
used it in afghanistan

524
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,759
no not not in the us

525
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,959
not in the us so

526
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,879
um

527
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,279
but yeah there was there was something

528
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,039
uh puck is the hash plan

529
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,839
you know they they or they think it is

530
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,720
that's what it's always i mean it looks

531
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,480
like traditional hash plant

532
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,880
hash plant strain

533
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
um like in that picture it does have a

534
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,200
lot of those similar traits it does have

535
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
a lot of similar traits you know yeah um

536
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
and it's out there in the community and

537
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,519
stuff like that people breed with it

538
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
so

539
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,400
you know at the very least it ties back

540
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,519
to something old

541
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
yeah

542
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,440
but that's most basically what they were

543
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,399
doing is is in america we were looking

544
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,519
for like

545
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,280
um

546
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,038
hash plants and afghans that we could

547
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,279
cross to other things and would bring

548
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,679
the flowering time and the height

549
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,359
and add some crystal and some density

550
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,080
um but uh but teeth but keep a lot of

551
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,839
the other qualities from the sativa yeah

552
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,399
those were sort of the first blends that

553
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,720
people were after

554
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
structurally what the hash plant did

555
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
yeah and the flavors of the sativa and

556
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,559
the high and the but the flavor and the

557
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
smoke and the stretch

558
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,200
you know yeah

559
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,519
so

560
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,519
um you know it it's one of those it's

561
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,038
one of those aspects where we put a

562
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,079
bunch of different selection pressures

563
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,079
on it but kept the name

564
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,839
see we got here so one of the ones often

565
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,159
mentioned is the cuttlefish you know

566
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,558
like or not often mentioned i should say

567
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,038
um but in the in the

568
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:02,639
like late 2000s it was used a lot by

569
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,319
subpool's crew and um best i could tell

570
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,960
i remember talking to jill about about

571
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,798
it

572
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
came from bad boy

573
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,798
whoever that was one of their buddies

574
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,640
and it was actually a super skunk cross

575
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,879
to skunk

576
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,520
uh skunk one and it was like a fruity

577
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,760
they say skunky fruity i'm not sure

578
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,839
on all that but yeah that was what the

579
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,679
cuttlefish plant was it wasn't even a

580
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,639
scentsy hash plant or seed bank cash

581
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,080
plant um it was a super skunk skunked

582
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
one

583
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,798
so we we had a bunch of people that were

584
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,798
just asking about the g13

585
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,079
so we could focus on that for a minute

586
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,240
hey fletch you want to come on and talk

587
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,558
to your 13 you're from that area

588
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,159
bring it

589
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,519
so like i said before one part of the

590
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
story is that

591
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,759
neville said on one of his american

592
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,120
trips uh he bought the g13 and the hash

593
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,839
plant clone yeah uh from somebody there

594
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,399
he is hey what's up fletch hey what's up

595
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,959
guys how you doing buddy good vernon

596
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,120
good to see you dude good to see you yep

597
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,000
what's going on

598
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,000
just hash plan

599
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,158
the old northwest favorites i mean i

600
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,000
think something that people forget

601
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,880
is that um

602
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,558
the northwest specifically uh like

603
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,120
washington state

604
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,720
is what hid lighting company came from

605
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,798
it's where some of the first hydroponics

606
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
companies came from that like the early

607
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,960
80s this was the spot to grow weed

608
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,798
because

609
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,120
the climate

610
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,319
is really good for having heat inside

611
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,000
your house generally all year round

612
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,918
everybody's always like oh the humidity

613
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,599
is so high up there well if you know

614
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,759
anything about

615
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:44,240
you know relative humidity

616
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,558
air that's 45 degrees and 80 humidity

617
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,558
and you bring that into like a 75 degree

618
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,079
grow room and hit it with all that heat

619
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,639
from all your equipment

620
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,639
it makes a perfect climate 40 yeah

621
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,159
humidity so

622
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
you always hear people oh there's mold

623
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,440
or powdery mildew i mean i i know tons

624
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,159
of growers from up here and powdery

625
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,720
mildew never existed in anyone's garden

626
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,520
until clones started coming up from yeah

627
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,240
specifically from ed rosenthal's

628
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:15,119
um operation in the you know early late

629
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,720
90s early 2000s with yeah the other

630
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,158
lady's name that was running it but they

631
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,339
would like i mean they spread that [ __ ]

632
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,720
worldwide

633
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,558
[Laughter]

634
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,880
that's what you want to be known for

635
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,079
you know centralized clone selling is

636
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,280
really what has spread most problems

637
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,359
everywhere

638
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,480
absolutely the dutting the you know the

639
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,319
the viroids the powdery mildews bugs all

640
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,919
these various different types of things

641
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,439
when people were just getting clones

642
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,960
from their buddy or a small group of

643
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,038
friends it kept most problems localized

644
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,720
yeah and it's when people start stop

645
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,960
maintaining their own mothers and we'll

646
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,400
just like oh i'll [ __ ] buy 200 cuts

647
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,519
for my next run

648
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
and started getting them from

649
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,038
dispensaries and getting them from these

650
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,599
centralized places

651
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,640
that's kind of when all these issues

652
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,719
um

653
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,440
started spreading like crazy

654
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,159
was because they'd get into a a poorly

655
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,080
run ed rosenthal situation or they'd get

656
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,840
into a dark heart or whatever and then

657
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,279
they would just sell to thousands of

658
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,959
people

659
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,440
exactly

660
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,120
well let's talk to g13

661
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,120
so you know what you know

662
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,119
so he probably knows but i will i will

663
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,918
say one more thing and then i'll shut up

664
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,918
is that um you know neville says that he

665
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,080
got it on this trip and jorge confirmed

666
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:33,038
it when we interviewed uh bjornsson

667
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,240
right that was like the one tidbit that

668
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,879
we got

669
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,960
was he remember he said that the g13 was

670
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
actually called

671
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,919
um

672
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
the uw

673
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,799
yeah the uw that's what his statement

674
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,120
was uh that was like literally an hour

675
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,599
and a half of of talking that was the

676
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,558
one piece of weed history that he

677
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,158
casually mentioned that like was was

678
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,879
any but you know it seems like it was

679
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,799
one of those like like fletch was saying

680
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,480
it was one of those things where

681
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,079
they were collecting different clones

682
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
that worked good indoors and trading

683
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,319
them

684
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,278
yeah

685
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,480
right

686
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,400
even up here people were really

687
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,319
reserved about sharing any kind of

688
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,200
clones um

689
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,678
that was true you know probably up until

690
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,000
medical changed in like 2008 with uh

691
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,480
obama's um

692
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,599
whatever that that uh announcement was

693
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,798
where everybody basically started

694
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,319
growing weed because it said the feds

695
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,158
weren't going to [ __ ] with you anymore

696
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,599
yeah yeah pause

697
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,159
so before that getting clones was hard i

698
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,918
mean people you know everybody just if

699
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,360
you had weave you never told anybody

700
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,159
where it came from

701
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,759
so

702
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
even if it was from your garden i mean

703
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,278
there's plenty of people you'd buy wheat

704
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,519
from you never knew they grew weed um

705
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,599
yeah for sure they they just said their

706
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,960
uncle got it or whoever

707
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,639
yeah and um

708
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,038
[Music]

709
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,278
so but the the g so what what were we

710
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,640
talking about g13 or what you want g13

711
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,599
let's do g13 uw stuff like that

712
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
um

713
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,480
so uw and well g13 as far as i know

714
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,000
there's two there's historically only

715
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,120
two clones

716
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,359
yeah airborne which is from ohio

717
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,158
and then there's pacific which is from

718
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,599
out here like west seattle yeah

719
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,640
um

720
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,240
the pacific was named pacific because of

721
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,440
the user

722
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,159
pacific on cannabis world yeah

723
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,679
she he i can't remember she was she was

724
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,960
like in some band or and i can't she was

725
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
some kind of

726
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,558
you know

727
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,759
modern [ __ ] of some sort yeah back then

728
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,960
but

729
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,879
um

730
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
she had two different clones i think

731
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,640
that's how she like to be

732
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,278
referred to and uh it was the

733
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,038
u-dub purple or i think didn't she call

734
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,200
it u-dub purple map

735
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:53,919
yeah you dub black or purple i don't

736
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
know

737
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,679
people call it uw-black now he said [ __ ]

738
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,640
that people made up out of nowhere yeah

739
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
the

740
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,038
the uw purple i think was and i think

741
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,798
she would sometimes call it purple g13

742
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,400
up here but

743
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,879
like

744
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
having been around here for a long time

745
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,679
um

746
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,278
i never saw the the uw purple or purple

747
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,080
that she had

748
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,480
yeah

749
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,599
is the same as the purple indica tacoma

750
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
perp

751
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,000
family of plants that's well known up

752
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,240
here in washington which is like how me

753
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,720
and caleb ended up becoming friends 20

754
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,720
years ago is because he had the oracle i

755
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,200
had the pi from up here

756
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,679
we knew those were families of plants

757
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,000
that were localized to our areas

758
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,440
and um we were trying to figure out hey

759
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,679
are these things related are they

760
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,080
similar and me personally having now

761
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,600
worked with the purple indica a lot and

762
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,038
knowing its history up here i mean it

763
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,798
wasn't even called purple indica when i

764
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,720
got it up here it was just

765
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,519
an unknown clone that i received and i

766
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,360
was just able to identify it as a plant

767
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:02,000
from

768
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,079
that family of purples yeah yeah caleb

769
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,038
and i we got this other clone that we

770
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,519
call the tacoma perp that came from

771
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,640
user stoney puff and stuff on yeah yeah

772
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,798
this world

773
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,000
and that was a different clone but the

774
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:19,278
same family of plants i also had pop bag

775
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,319
seeds in like 2002 of that from those

776
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,839
bags of that same weed i got plants they

777
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:29,439
were all almost identical to

778
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,359
you could have passed any of them off as

779
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,399
any of the purple weed that comes around

780
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,398
up here

781
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,678
yeah and uh

782
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,519
that was kind of that's kind of the same

783
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,440
with urkel you know it's like you've got

784
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,480
urkel

785
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,360
um

786
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
great

787
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:48,240
all that [ __ ] 71 whatever yeah yeah 20

788
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:51,918
different versions of the same

789
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,319
essentially genotype of expression yeah

790
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,840
okay phenotype within a population or

791
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,240
whatever yeah

792
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,918
so um

793
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,240
and it's hard to say whether the chicken

794
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,840
or the egg came from right yeah did the

795
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,679
earth will come first or did the gdp

796
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,798
which one came from which one and unless

797
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,640
you have

798
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,918
let's have a district of it it's pretty

799
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,520
proud so

800
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,880
the g13s the airborne g13

801
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,519
um

802
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,000
that i've seen

803
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,440
is probably most definitely related to

804
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
the lemon

805
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,038
aka lemon g13 that was all as it was

806
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,359
also called

807
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:31,359
okay both carry this trait and it's also

808
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:35,519
a um

809
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:38,719
i think it's a virus that transfers from

810
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,440
it through seed from parent right

811
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,960
i don't have the actual data to support

812
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,038
exactly that

813
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
but for example the lemon peel that i

814
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:50,158
have is

815
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,159
crossed with iodine that has a

816
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,600
wrap or virus we have tested for that

817
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,679
right

818
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,678
it's had it basically

819
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,120
i mean like after the second run from

820
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,320
clone

821
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,359
it had it

822
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,439
and i've never um

823
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,278
i it doesn't transfer to any other

824
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,640
strains at all

825
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,200
except for

826
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,278
lemon g hybrids

827
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,798
weird p13 so that is really weird

828
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,200
and so does the lemon g itself

829
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,558
what kind of virus is it do you know rap

830
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,278
or virus

831
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,678
what is it i'm sorry raspberry dwarf

832
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,359
virus interesting

833
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,080
there you heard that

834
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,240
so um

835
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,480
anyways my point is simply that there

836
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,720
can even be you know stuff like that

837
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,839
that can show you

838
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,640
um

839
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,000
potentially a genetic relation

840
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
yeah for sure

841
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,519
um

842
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,919
but i mean we've never sold pure lemon

843
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,038
peel hybrids you know for this yeah

844
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,559
yeah

845
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,398
that's wild um i i think i think uh the

846
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,319
the airborne is the one that pip showed

847
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,038
us not so the one that he was keeping

848
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,038
his g13 that he called ohio g13

849
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,798
and i think he had a similar theory that

850
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,798
it that it was related to the lemon g

851
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,278
well he had the limit i mean he rocked

852
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,278
the lemon g like he monopropped it in

853
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,720
that region for years too he was really

854
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,119
familiar with it

855
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,960
um and i will say that you know one

856
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,879
thing about the pacific that makes me

857
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,679
think that it's probably old is that it

858
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,520
is really ugly

859
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,000
you know it's not a pretty plant in my

860
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,960
opinion which one the the pacific you

861
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
know

862
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,720
you know like or pips like the g like i

863
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,278
mean that's kind of like one of its

864
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,120
things right was like the g13 was like

865
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,278
when when neville would chat about it

866
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,599
like you know he said it was uh it was

867
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,038
kind of ugly but it had crazy

868
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,199
you know it had it added a bunch of

869
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,440
potency and a bunch of crystal

870
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
yeah but by itself it wasn't all that

871
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,519
good

872
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,119
so when i did all those high times

873
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,480
events and everything

874
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,558
you know every once in a while you'd

875
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,759
have someone come through

876
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,678
that

877
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,558
you and they were always old-timers you

878
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,679
know like

879
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,879
these are more

880
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,798
and they would just come through and

881
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,320
just tell you some information about a

882
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,398
strain that you potentially have on your

883
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,879
menu or have hybrids of

884
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,479
and this older lady kate had come to my

885
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
booth i think it was either at emerald

886
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,278
cup or one of the other high times

887
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,720
events

888
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,558
and she told me do you know what the

889
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,640
lemon g13 is and i said

890
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:25,200
well i i first had gotten it from

891
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,880
shroomie back in like 2005 or so

892
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,120
so i knew it was old i knew it was from

893
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,120
ohio because he was in pittsburgh so it

894
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,839
was from right across the border there

895
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,839
and um

896
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,240
the lemon g was like

897
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,439
you know

898
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,319
it um

899
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,558
it's a very distinct plant yeah

900
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,678
it for anything else it's smell how it

901
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,918
grows

902
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,919
it's kind of like just a really big

903
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,000
plant with big buds but kind of not the

904
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,159
most resonant thing anyways

905
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,919
she said that it was the um g13 right

906
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,240
that's from out there

907
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,640
with a skunk misty from scentsy seeds

908
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,640
that hermied onto it and that's that

909
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,519
story yeah

910
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,200
and

911
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,038
it makes perfect sense to me if you look

912
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,038
at the plants if you've ever grown it

913
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,640
does have skunk number one type growth

914
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,640
characteristics

915
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,679
that's where those long running colas

916
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,000
came from

917
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,200
exactly

918
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,200
number one from amsterdam

919
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,839
then

920
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,960
if you've grown the airborne g13 that

921
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,158
weird and

922
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,600
sour

923
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,159
bitter smell brian yeah hell that's from

924
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,918
the airborne g and so it's like you can

925
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,840
smell it between the airborne and it's

926
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,759
it's pretty obvious and then so like i

927
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,158
was saying between all those factors

928
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,879
plus the dwarf virus that's all that's

929
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,080
self-contained to that specific family

930
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,559
of plants

931
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,960
it's pretty

932
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:56,319
identifiable yeah i can't say for

933
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
certain whether or not it's all a

934
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,599
hundred percent the same family so that

935
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:03,519
kind of covers the

936
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:06,480
the airborne g13 right

937
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,079
most likely a clone from ohio um i don't

938
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,240
know any other history other than that

939
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,119
and most likely the parent to lemon g as

940
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,880
well

941
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,239
yeah cool that's what i know as well

942
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
about it

943
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,679
survived in ohio this is a little off

944
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,359
topic but since we touched it a little

945
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,679
bit what do you think on the purple

946
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,199
indica versus circle

947
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,159
i've grown enough

948
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
oh that's what i was going to say

949
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,399
earlier i've grown enough

950
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,839
pi hybrids

951
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:34,479
that i've gotten oracle phenotypes from

952
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,480
purple indica hybrids wow though

953
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,798
it wouldn't surprise me in the least

954
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,038
especially considering how widespread

955
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,918
that purple indica clone or that family

956
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,640
of clones was

957
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,038
i would bet money if you if you showed

958
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,759
that purple indica to greg that he would

959
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,839
immediately be able to identify it just

960
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,158
like every other guy i know that's been

961
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,038
up in seattle and northern oregon for

962
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,120
the last 30 years growing weed almost

963
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,839
every single one of them you can pull it

964
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,879
out

965
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,038
immediately identifiable by them

966
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,440
i've never tried i should i'll see what

967
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:09,440
he says

968
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,759
yeah what i'd like to do is go out there

969
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,320
and bring him a bunch of samples and see

970
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,000
if he can identify anything

971
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,320
you guys know i mean you guys are kind

972
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,280
of close out there yeah i mean relative

973
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
no

974
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,839
oh

975
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
oh

976
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,918
but you know what i'm saying though is

977
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,519
that like who knows what kind of smells

978
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,118
he could potentially identify as just

979
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,559
being related to something just like i

980
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,559
was talking about the lemon g and the

981
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,639
g13 yeah

982
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,398
and then the pacific g13 i never saw

983
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,200
anything but a couple samples of it and

984
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,759
it never was very impressive yeah

985
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,838
the uw purple that purple family that we

986
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,760
were just talking about purple indica

987
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,519
those are definitely not related to the

988
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
pacific g13 and then uw was just a name

989
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,079
for

990
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,519
any weed that came out of the university

991
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,760
of washington

992
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,759
area of seattle which was

993
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,240
like kind of where you would go buy weed

994
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,240
off the streets you know kind of like in

995
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,799
park in new york kind of deal

996
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,799
like go down to the u district and you

997
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,680
could buy wheat off the streets

998
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,560
um

999
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,199
and then you had you know between that

1000
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,320
the glass blowers which was a giant part

1001
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:20,319
that is often overlooked and

1002
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,000
glossed over as if it wasn't an

1003
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,240
important part of it but

1004
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,239
the glass blowing scene was a large

1005
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,239
part of and

1006
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,598
of the distribution network of clones

1007
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,519
around the country

1008
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,240
very much so you know i mean when i

1009
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,280
first got the trinity and the and the

1010
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,118
snow

1011
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,119
uh and you know a bunch of those things

1012
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,160
that was all out of eugene glassblowing

1013
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,160
circles

1014
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,838
exactly you know it was all that was

1015
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,920
that was one of the ways that hippies

1016
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
spread and communicated and and they

1017
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,800
they were blowing pipes and they they

1018
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,759
had ends

1019
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,359
exactly the dog [ __ ] stain channels

1020
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
um

1021
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:57,920
try to think of other strains that were

1022
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,358
class

1023
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,039
seen um the super bill um i mean there's

1024
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,239
a there's a handful of strains up here

1025
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,400
that that

1026
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,838
maybe haven't gotten any air time but

1027
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,440
the cough was super um oh yeah traveled

1028
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,960
everywhere through the through the glass

1029
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,838
blowing scene i mean the cough was like

1030
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,720
a

1031
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,199
a

1032
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,919
oh somebody just said the quindy

1033
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,399
that's another one quimby

1034
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,159
i heard of it the quimby is just another

1035
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,760
is from oregon it's just another like

1036
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,759
old it was one of those strains passed

1037
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,880
around those same circles

1038
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,400
the green

1039
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,079
that was one two

1040
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,599
you know they they even had their own

1041
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,720
four-way

1042
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,440
which wasn't like a four-way from uh was

1043
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,118
like a four-way from organ

1044
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,960
but they just called it the same thing

1045
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,640
but it wasn't anything related to

1046
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,400
neville's or anything from europe it was

1047
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,920
like trinity by something by something i

1048
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,200
can't remember

1049
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,720
for sure

1050
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,519
but

1051
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,279
so

1052
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:57,440
that was that's my knowledge of g13 you

1053
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,920
know it's it's

1054
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,559
somewhat anecdotal but i've seen a lot

1055
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,760
of samples you know over the years so

1056
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,358
hold on a second people are saying we're

1057
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,160
not just hearing facts we're hearing

1058
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,639
conjecture about g13 the reason for that

1059
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,960
is because the g13 is from the 80s which

1060
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,559
is a long [ __ ] time ago and the

1061
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,838
memories are old and some of them are

1062
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,078
legends

1063
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,000
what we what we think we know for sure

1064
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,359
is that it came out of the pacific

1065
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,920
northwest

1066
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,960
okay and that's when it first popped up

1067
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
and friends of jorge cervantes gave it

1068
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,720
to neville

1069
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,838
who took it to europe and bred with it

1070
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,719
and that's

1071
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,639
huh

1072
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,838
i can add to it and the name supposedly

1073
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,679
came from the license plate uh as best

1074
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,599
as i've dug

1075
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,838
and yeah the license plates

1076
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,240
license and then and so it became and it

1077
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,838
became traded so then it was bred in the

1078
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,000
europe and then it was traded in the

1079
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,000
pacific northwest then it kind of became

1080
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,679
this legendary thing

1081
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,199
for the most part and so some of it is

1082
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,039
conjecture because you have all these

1083
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,239
things called g13 but what's their

1084
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,279
origin

1085
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,000
i mean

1086
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,000
one thing i'd like to mention is that

1087
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,039
when i first started growing g13 was not

1088
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,800
a really well-known subject the only

1089
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,960
thing was some internet

1090
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,720
folklore about it and the fact that it

1091
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
was in the catalog back in the day that

1092
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:20,319
was the only knowledge about it

1093
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:23,279
and no one really gave a [ __ ] at all

1094
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,680
about it until that movie american

1095
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,880
whatever came out american beauty yeah

1096
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:31,519
yeah thousand dollar ounce of g13 on the

1097
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,280
[ __ ] uh american beauty movie and

1098
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,280
then everybody's like what's that g13

1099
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,560
[ __ ] is that some [ __ ] came from the

1100
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,720
government it's the same thing that

1101
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:40,559
happened with uw is like

1102
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,559
when i was buying weed

1103
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,719
uw was just a str

1104
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,639
came from an area could be multiple

1105
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,959
different strains it was like crippy or

1106
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,879
any of those other names it was never a

1107
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,960
single variety

1108
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,119
and then once you had like the medical

1109
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,119
scene around here pop up

1110
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,358
and you had people trying to like kind

1111
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,680
of stake their claim in the ground but

1112
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,920
didn't weren't really in the scene prior

1113
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,319
to that they're like i have the original

1114
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,760
uw like dude there never even was like

1115
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
the fact that you're even trying to say

1116
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,599
you have

1117
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,440
the only you dub is how i know you don't

1118
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,599
have it because

1119
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,599
because it doesn't exist you're trying

1120
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,960
to stake a claim about something that

1121
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,359
was um

1122
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,440
that was just a name that wasn't

1123
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,960
specified to a fighting

1124
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,800
yeah

1125
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,079
very much kind of like thunder [ __ ] you

1126
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,560
know all those or even or even diesel

1127
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,720
yeah yeah i mean my my buddies who lived

1128
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,759
in new york in that era that that was

1129
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,759
slang for for dank weed right then

1130
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,200
was it that diesel you got that diesel i

1131
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
mean now it like means something much

1132
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,799
more specific

1133
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
but it started off as just slaying for a

1134
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,440
good weed

1135
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,359
exactly

1136
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,320
exactly and no indian guy did not have

1137
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,078
anything to do with g13

1138
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,359
people making up stuffs

1139
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,880
um so

1140
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,319
while we have you here let's touch on

1141
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,160
another hash plant i know we've done

1142
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,640
this before but i don't think we've done

1143
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,920
it on the syndicate show uh hp 13.

1144
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,239
um

1145
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,240
yeah i mean my only experience with it

1146
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:14,879
is that

1147
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:17,598
i went to those parties in hawaii um

1148
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,838
back in the early 2000s and that was

1149
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,160
that's the same the jason king can of

1150
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,000
bible group of people

1151
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,719
and that was the only place i ever saw

1152
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,480
it

1153
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,318
and it was well known amongst their

1154
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,760
circle that it had come from new york

1155
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,800
city or from new york somewhere right

1156
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,760
um

1157
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,400
it's not from hawaii it

1158
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,880
was brought there by

1159
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,480
from my understanding a bunch of hippies

1160
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,838
okay

1161
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,920
and that's that's basically yeah i mean

1162
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,239
what'd you think about it

1163
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,760
i always deserve the height

1164
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,838
no well when i first saw it and it was

1165
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,119
like jungle grown i was like oh hell no

1166
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,159
this [ __ ]

1167
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,400
right

1168
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,118
yeah and i think i got the clone later

1169
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,079
from uh from caleb

1170
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,480
yeah

1171
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,480
um

1172
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,960
i grew it i like the terps on it a lot

1173
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,439
but doesn't transfer to flavor

1174
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,358
particularly well it itself

1175
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,280
um it's more one of those

1176
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,159
strains you can taste it because it

1177
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,839
smells so strong not because it converts

1178
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:22,879
to a really tasty flavor

1179
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:26,000
yeah and uh it's herme prone the lower

1180
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,760
bottoms on it always through sax if you

1181
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
would have light leaks or anything like

1182
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,000
that

1183
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,200
and um

1184
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,838
it's pretty hard to breed with in my

1185
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,838
experience

1186
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,318
but it has one of the more unique

1187
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,760
terpene profiles out

1188
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,318
so that's one thing jason king was

1189
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,680
correct about is that the the profile is

1190
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:48,480
unique

1191
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,799
yeah

1192
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,280
it's always it's always a bummer to me

1193
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,318
when that hurt profile is so strong and

1194
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,079
direct

1195
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,039
and then it doesn't translate into the

1196
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,760
smoke

1197
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,279
like bubblegum like like that but like

1198
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
yeah like the version of bubblegum you

1199
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,560
know it smells sometimes the smell and

1200
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,838
the

1201
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,000
you know i mean that's the same thing

1202
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,920
true with hash too sometimes flavors on

1203
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,358
flour don't translate into any of the

1204
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,119
hash you make with it

1205
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,838
yeah right

1206
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,760
yeah it's not that hp 13 doesn't have a

1207
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,000
good flavor it's just like it's so

1208
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,800
strong you expect it

1209
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,960
it

1210
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,839
promises to deliver more than it

1211
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,960
actually does because the spell is so

1212
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,799
potent on it right yeah um but what's

1213
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,720
what it what one thing i've found with

1214
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,119
having run through so many seed plants

1215
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,078
over so many years

1216
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,720
is that

1217
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,760
there's this fine line between

1218
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,439
um

1219
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,599
there's like three different types of

1220
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,559
textures of wheat in my

1221
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,880
main textures there's really terpy stuff

1222
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,159
that's low in thc and it kind of has

1223
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,039
that soft silky feel to the resin it's

1224
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,519
not sticky it's not tacky and you

1225
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,039
can't wash with it at all right then you

1226
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,838
have like the other end of the spectrum

1227
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,239
which is like really high in thc

1228
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:07,599
but whatever terpenes are in it

1229
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:09,598
don't make it slick right it's just like

1230
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,318
alcohol and water you add enough alcohol

1231
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,838
to water and it won't freeze right so if

1232
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,039
you it most terpenes and and styles and

1233
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:18,799
everything else in it are like

1234
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,239
alcohol-like compounds they have low

1235
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,680
freeze

1236
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:27,439
so when you mix that with thc

1237
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:30,799
you need enough thc to stabilize the

1238
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,039
terpenes or vice versa right so you have

1239
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,119
really terpy low thc it kind of has that

1240
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,800
soft feel and it sometimes the [ __ ] just

1241
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,039
doesn't translate to flavor no matter

1242
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,920
how terpy it is yeah they have the stuff

1243
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,000
that's like all thc but no terps

1244
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,240
and um

1245
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,239
and that [ __ ] wash is like crazy but it

1246
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,879
always lacks in flavor and then you have

1247
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,199
stuff where it's really [ __ ] terpy

1248
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,519
and it's really high in thc and it's

1249
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:58,799
that stick to the wall type [ __ ] yeah

1250
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,039
and that's almost always the best

1251
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,800
flower to smoke

1252
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,199
that's like that's like all the old

1253
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,318
elites that ended up testing between 18

1254
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,838
and 24 thc or something and they just

1255
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:10,639
had that blend

1256
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,119
of

1257
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,318
terps and flavor and enough potency to

1258
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,400
get you there

1259
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,039
entourage effect whatever you wanted it

1260
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,440
was interesting for me seeing a bunch of

1261
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,838
holding a big library and then when

1262
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,440
testing first started happening and you

1263
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:26,799
started getting to see what your weed

1264
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,800
was like

1265
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,079
me realizing that like i mean i don't i

1266
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,920
don't know about i don't know about you

1267
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,519
flesh i don't really like most

1268
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,720
30 plus

1269
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,559
strains

1270
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,480
i kind of find them bland like the ones

1271
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,639
that work best for me like are somewhere

1272
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,920
in the in the low to mid 20s most of the

1273
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,039
time

1274
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,519
i mean i don't

1275
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,599
just taste really strong i don't even

1276
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,000
care about the potency of it and at the

1277
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,960
end of the day i mean you know i used to

1278
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,519
have

1279
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,679
jo i mean still have hundreds of jars

1280
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,679
available if someone comes over and they

1281
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,480
can smoke through whatever and that

1282
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:04,318
purple indica only tests like 15 to 18

1283
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,960
percent on a good day and for 20 years

1284
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,759
no matter what everybody picked out of

1285
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,079
my pile of jars to smoke they'd always

1286
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,119
say that was the most potent strain to

1287
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,318
them had the most narcotic effects

1288
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,680
so obviously thc isn't the only thing

1289
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,000
the other thing is

1290
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,000
there's hundreds of known cannabinoids

1291
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,880
we only test for like 10 of them maybe

1292
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,358
in

1293
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,400
bioassays and

1294
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,799
um

1295
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,960
we and we've just found like did you

1296
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,920
guys see that italian

1297
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,960
um research paper where they found that

1298
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,800
thc that's 30 times more potent than thc

1299
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,800
and they found it with power

1300
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,400
so okay so if you have one percent of

1301
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,680
that that's the equivalent of 30 thc so

1302
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,000
get power that's twenty percent thc and

1303
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,000
then have one percent of this

1304
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,039
secondary cannabinoid that we currently

1305
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,079
don't test for thcp if that's what it is

1306
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,639
yeah

1307
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,640
that [ __ ] might feel like it's 50

1308
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,239
right because you've got 30 percent with

1309
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,480
that extra potent stuff it's like you

1310
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,519
know it's like heroin and fentanyl yeah

1311
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,199
he doesn't

1312
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,280
go fanny

1313
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,279
yeah absolutely

1314
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,960
and for people asking this will be up on

1315
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,800
youtube after we're going to try to have

1316
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,240
it up in audio as well

1317
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
later on

1318
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,479
so that's it i mean that's that's kind

1319
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,838
of a tangent but it's basically

1320
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,240
in my opinion

1321
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,960
there's absolutely no way

1322
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,959
uh you know to to tell like how well

1323
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,720
wheat is going to work on someone

1324
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,880
by the available testing that we

1325
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,959
commonly do today

1326
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,280
you can get a general sense of low or

1327
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,440
high thc and you can get some terpenes

1328
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,519
and you can learn some things from it

1329
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,960
but it's not comprehensive enough by any

1330
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:45,679
means

1331
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,480
to

1332
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,000
to tell you why why it works

1333
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,519
the way that it does

1334
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,318
yeah i mean you're you're talking about

1335
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:56,318
we're only testing for you know

1336
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,400
five or ten percent of the potential

1337
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,679
cannabinoids most of which the other

1338
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,358
cannabinoids we don't even know what

1339
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,719
they do still

1340
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,078
and then uh

1341
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,239
then you're talking about we test for a

1342
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,760
small portion of the terpenes and dials

1343
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,439
and everything that else it produces so

1344
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,040
it's like we're gonna start making

1345
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,039
assumptions with

1346
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,599
ten percent of the data we're gonna yeah

1347
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,199
that's bad assumptions about the plants

1348
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,359
with ten percent of the data that's

1349
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,519
pretty useless science right there

1350
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:22,318
it's almost like phyllos creating a

1351
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:24,480
whole

1352
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:27,679
system on it telling you you could have

1353
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,440
genetic relation with about the same and

1354
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,598
it's also quite possible that we put the

1355
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,920
most importance on thc

1356
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,119
simply because it's the oldest compound

1357
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,639
we know of that relates to marijuana and

1358
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,640
so we've just we've just all been

1359
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,879
preconditioned to accept that that's the

1360
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:45,118
big macro no you know why we're

1361
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,200
pre-conditioned is because that the

1362
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,440
compound they made illegal

1363
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,199
yeah yeah yeah you know that's the one

1364
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,039
that the government said was the most

1365
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,039
important compound

1366
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,558
and it's at the end of the day it's

1367
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,000
probably not

1368
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,920
that's kind of what my whole point we

1369
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,280
could we could know 15 or 20 years from

1370
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,159
now that this combination of

1371
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,800
cannabinoids or whatever is actually

1372
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,078
way more important to like this specific

1373
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,440
feeling than any number on that level

1374
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,240
exactly

1375
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,358
you know so and now it had all these

1376
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,439
people breeding for 32 thc

1377
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,480
with no terps and still smokes like

1378
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,599
[ __ ]

1379
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,119
smoking gravel yeah

1380
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,880
um

1381
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,280
and it's all because we're using a

1382
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,358
testing system to sell stuff to

1383
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,519
consumers that isn't even in their best

1384
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,960
interest

1385
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,480
you know let you said something the

1386
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,280
other day and i know it

1387
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,119
it

1388
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,280
it didn't like a lot of people found it

1389
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,920
controversial but i thought i i could

1390
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,920
relate to it very well and you made a

1391
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,119
comment that you're done with regular

1392
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,440
seeds

1393
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,280
and it's on to femme seeds

1394
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,639
can you can you like extrapolate on that

1395
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,280
a little bit so people understand what

1396
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,879
you were actually saying saying

1397
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,359
oh i'm just making jokes most of the

1398
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,519
time i know but i mean

1399
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,598
but it's relevant right people take this

1400
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,039
[ __ ] way too seriously but i mean you

1401
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,200
know the the people that always have the

1402
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,920
most to say are typically the people

1403
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:12,000
that are offended by it the most right

1404
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,680
and sure offended well maybe they're not

1405
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,519
so proud of what they're doing i don't

1406
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,159
know

1407
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,599
i just i just related to it so much um

1408
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,759
trying to sell regular seeds in this

1409
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,880
market right now is is very very

1410
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,400
difficult there's not as much of a uh

1411
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,000
i don't even know if there is a big

1412
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,119
market left for regular seeds at the

1413
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,119
moment

1414
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,559
no i mean mo people aren't particular

1415
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,880
you know especially with the compression

1416
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,559
and pricing people are not concerned

1417
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,079
with doing things the right way they're

1418
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,920
concerned with how they're going to pay

1419
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,760
their bills and make it to the next crop

1420
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,559
or keep the lights on at their facility

1421
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,920
or

1422
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,920
whatever and i mean that's why you got

1423
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,838
people that are like

1424
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,960
you know they got a thousand lights up

1425
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,279
they don't know what to do with any of

1426
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,720
the product and their choices at that

1427
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,720
point are

1428
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,239
i'm gonna partner with someone that's

1429
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,039
gonna run the thing and sell it all for

1430
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,959
me or i'm going to start hitting up

1431
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,480
people that work at nurseries of other

1432
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,240
businesses

1433
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,440
tell their nursery employee hey i'll

1434
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:10,000
give you 50 grand to buy a clone from

1435
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,079
whoever right and then try and undercut

1436
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,358
their market and it's like look you're

1437
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,680
you're never going to create a market

1438
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,838
for yourself by always just picking up

1439
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,919
the scraps of somebody else's that's a

1440
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:22,239
fact man it's a fact

1441
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,400
so you know what's the point of picking

1442
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,000
up someone else's scraps it's like you

1443
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,400
should be working on your own stuff

1444
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,039
because then you can then you can

1445
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,800
then you can have enough burn rate on

1446
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,960
whatever that product is for yourself

1447
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,720
that you can take advantage of that and

1448
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,119
be proud of what you're doing and you

1449
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,679
know that [ __ ] won't offend you anymore

1450
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,519
yeah that's a fact man one thing i've

1451
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,279
learned too is that all these dudes that

1452
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,119
like to knock stuff off that's what they

1453
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,119
do for a living it's all going to come

1454
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,480
to a screeching halt when

1455
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,680
a lot of the people that are producing

1456
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,440
unique [ __ ]

1457
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,799
are no longer doing it

1458
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,240
you know once those people are removed

1459
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,559
from the equation then who's going to

1460
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,358
make the unique [ __ ] no one that's cut

1461
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,640
off they're done you know exactly it's

1462
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,558
like what

1463
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,480
what's the point in all just chopping

1464
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,559
each other's legs off when we could all

1465
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,960
just be producing something only a

1466
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,040
generation or two removed but is now

1467
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,240
because you did your work and found

1468
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,440
something cool

1469
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,279
um

1470
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,800
now the market's bigger instead of

1471
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,800
smaller right

1472
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,039
well if you guys want to survive you

1473
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,519
better work on making the market bigger

1474
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,279
for everybody that's in it not smaller

1475
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,599
yeah

1476
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,480
it kind of reminds me of like the just

1477
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,000
like the the human nature aspect

1478
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,599
of all this [ __ ]

1479
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,920
you know because

1480
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,440
there's a part of it too where

1481
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,880
you know you think about it like in

1482
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,559
music or something like that when

1483
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,480
there's like something you know people

1484
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,640
come out and they just create something

1485
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,400
and then that creates a demand for it

1486
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,519
and then there's a whole bunch of other

1487
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,358
musicians who follow in their footsteps

1488
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,440
because it's easier than creating their

1489
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,279
own thing now there's like a now there's

1490
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,280
like a heavy metal genre there's like a

1491
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,599
gangster rap genre there's like a

1492
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,319
there's an era where like it's not named

1493
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,079
people are just doing [ __ ] exactly right

1494
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,239
and so what's happened with the with the

1495
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,160
named with the named you know strain

1496
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,000
game basically is that rather than

1497
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,759
people breeding a bunch of weed that

1498
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,960
they like and trying to get more weed

1499
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,520
that they like

1500
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,679
they're like oh [ __ ] this thing from

1501
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,440
archive or mat or whoever is is blowing

1502
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,679
up right now i'm gonna cross everything

1503
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,679
to docido i'm gonna cross everything to

1504
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,919
skittles i'm gonna cross everything to

1505
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,279
cushmits i'm gonna cross everything to

1506
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,079
because it's popular and they're trying

1507
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,839
to put their own flavor on it but it's

1508
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,039
not like it just happens in weed that

1509
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:36,480
happens anywhere where there's

1510
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,558
opportunity

1511
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,760
right you know and you know the other

1512
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,519
thing i was thinking of when you guys

1513
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,960
were talking about the breeding aspect

1514
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,358
was that

1515
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,519
even talking about seeds today

1516
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,119
when you know when neville was on mr

1517
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,199
nice or whatever he used to talk about

1518
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,880
people would all the time [ __ ] that

1519
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,318
they wanted all these pure indica

1520
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,760
hybrids

1521
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,920
yeah but if they didn't yield to the

1522
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,640
roof and they weren't amazing in every

1523
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,480
way they'd [ __ ] up a storm and so he

1524
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,719
was constantly thinking about like what

1525
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,800
he could release

1526
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,118
and what the public would accept

1527
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,720
yeah so it made me think that even today

1528
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,599
right now we got there's a difference

1529
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:16,639
between what the public says it wants

1530
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,680
and then where it's money talks

1531
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,440
in terms of buying seats

1532
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,078
because it says it wants a lot of stuff

1533
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,920
that it doesn't really support

1534
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,680
exactly exactly right

1535
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,838
i think it's the price compression like

1536
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,159
everybody's looking for everyone wants

1537
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:35,279
something different but they all want to

1538
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,239
sell that have the same sales strategy

1539
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,800
right

1540
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:41,199
purple frosty and want to sell 100 pack

1541
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,800
right yeah um they're i mean they're not

1542
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,960
everybody i mean there are companies

1543
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,760
that are phenomenal

1544
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,760
they're working on on providing unique

1545
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,520
varieties to their business regardless

1546
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,680
of whether or not it's a hype strain or

1547
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,519
not and and they're in all markets i

1548
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,679
mean there's um

1549
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,199
you know there's there's a good amount

1550
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,078
of those companies that are working on

1551
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,439
it now

1552
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,119
um

1553
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,720
but the problem becomes depending on how

1554
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,200
big their business is is

1555
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,679
the most productive varieties typically

1556
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,679
aren't the dankest and if you're selling

1557
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,919
to a wholesale only market and aren't

1558
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,078
vertically integrated it's really hard

1559
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,838
to grow a two pound variety instead of a

1560
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,039
three pound variety or whatever the

1561
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,078
difference is

1562
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,239
and

1563
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,880
just like fruits and vegetables the big

1564
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:28,078
old monster tomatoes typically are the

1565
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,240
ones that taste like water yeah for sure

1566
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,039
yeah i mean that's that's like uh one of

1567
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,639
caleb and i's running jokes dude is that

1568
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,318
the shitty little thing in the corner

1569
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,279
that you thought about killing ends up

1570
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:41,440
being the clear winner in the smoke test

1571
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,839
always and you're like why is that

1572
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,599
[ __ ] run over there like why is that

1573
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,798
one head and shoulders above all these

1574
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,359
beautiful producing structure amazing

1575
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,798
dense buds all over it and this

1576
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,400
stressed out little thing here that

1577
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,920
almost died that's the one that everyone

1578
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,920
wants the smoke

1579
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,920
i think it's a

1580
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,559
i think the the smoke ability of a

1581
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,680
stream is a combination of two things in

1582
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,640
my opinion

1583
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,759
it's the type of and how much resin

1584
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,798
there is

1585
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,520
on the plant material then there is

1586
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,880
how the plant material smokes itself and

1587
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,280
those are two completely different

1588
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,480
things yeah that's why people like hash

1589
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,200
is because you get rid of all the plant

1590
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,760
material so now the [ __ ] that like has

1591
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,838
good terps or good trichomes on it but

1592
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,920
shitty plant material you can smoke it

1593
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,239
now strawberry banana it's like man the

1594
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,559
flower is completely

1595
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,318
nothing to write home about but yeah

1596
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,720
make some fresh frozen hash with it's

1597
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,599
great it's awesome yeah you know

1598
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,838
banana smoothie so

1599
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,640
there you know there's a purpose for

1600
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,519
that

1601
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,159
but

1602
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,239
when you start talking about like mass

1603
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,920
versus trichomes

1604
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,598
if you increase the mass but there's

1605
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,119
only the same amount of trichomes it's

1606
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,519
inevitably probably going to continue to

1607
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,880
taste worse so whatever has the least

1608
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,159
amount of

1609
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,640
mass that smokes poorly of flour

1610
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:05,358
material with the highest concentration

1611
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,639
of resin good tasty resin

1612
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:08,159
it's probably going to be your best

1613
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,558
wheat so

1614
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,159
to me it's just a trichome concentration

1615
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,000
versus

1616
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:14,838
plant mass

1617
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,440
that's

1618
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,759
interesting yeah

1619
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,000
i i look at it a little differently

1620
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,440
because i i talk about burn ability all

1621
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,798
the time right because that's really

1622
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,159
important to me

1623
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,559
but i i think that there's like a

1624
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,078
there's like an air to bud ratio

1625
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,000
you know like i mean obviously some

1626
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,240
things you put them on this you know you

1627
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,239
put them on and and the thing is huge

1628
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:37,598
but it weighs three grams

1629
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,358
other thing you put it on and it's the

1630
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,240
same it's the same size and it weighs

1631
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,759
eight

1632
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:43,279
you know so i think like how dense

1633
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,440
things are like one of the things i like

1634
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,680
about diesels is it kind of has all

1635
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,200
those like nooks and crannies and hills

1636
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,879
and crevices and different things the

1637
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:53,838
way the bud forms

1638
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,079
so it's like it's not that dense

1639
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,920
right and then i think that makes it

1640
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,839
that's what i was saying is the amount

1641
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,798
of trichomes versus the mass of the

1642
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,480
plant material the plant material yeah

1643
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,798
and it seems like that stuff washes

1644
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,199
better because there's more surface area

1645
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,880
where like this super thick stuff you

1646
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:12,879
almost have to chop it up into little

1647
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,440
bits to get it to wash well because

1648
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,440
there's only so much exposed

1649
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,318
exactly

1650
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,440
how much

1651
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,440
can you get on x amount of mass of flour

1652
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,720
and it's things like bubba right it's

1653
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,400
like

1654
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,798
you know you could bubba doesn't have a

1655
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,400
lot of surface area to put

1656
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,358
because it's so dense with plant

1657
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,358
material yeah yeah and why does it test

1658
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:39,358
low and why does one little nug like

1659
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:40,798
this turn into like a joint that's

1660
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,598
[ __ ] that fat

1661
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,440
yeah yeah that's why because it has a

1662
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,480
lot of plant material mass

1663
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,079
yeah

1664
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,679
i mean there was there was an aspect too

1665
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,359
where i used to have this i used to have

1666
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:52,159
this judge of whether i thought things

1667
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:54,400
were

1668
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,318
like perfect density to me

1669
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,798
like when i was breeding stuff a bunch

1670
00:57:56,318 --> 00:58:01,119
was could i break it off in the dark and

1671
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,599
put it into a pipe and smoke it

1672
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,760
effectively

1673
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,440
and if and if you can't do that without

1674
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,400
like the snow used to be like that like

1675
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,240
you almost needed scissors or a grinder

1676
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,079
you know if you just broke off a big

1677
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,279
chunk and shoved it into a bowl or a

1678
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,640
bong or something like that it would

1679
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,599
barely burn

1680
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,798
yeah

1681
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,798
it's too dense prohibition selection

1682
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,798
standards

1683
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,559
you know and you know cookies cookies

1684
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,639
cookies can be like that too it can be

1685
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,519
too dense

1686
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:33,759
yeah

1687
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,440
for sure you know it breeds a certain

1688
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,720
density

1689
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,798
what have you been focusing on in um

1690
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,480
on your projects lately like uh is there

1691
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:43,838
anything you're stoked about anything

1692
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,440
you're working with lately that you're

1693
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:47,519
like [ __ ] this is so unique and so

1694
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,039
different that i you know i'm gonna work

1695
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,920
on this for a few years anything like

1696
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:51,920
that currently going on

1697
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,559
i mean man i'm just always just

1698
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,318
selecting through plants i mean i just

1699
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,200
popped like another 500 seeds the other

1700
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,599
day

1701
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,039
for me it's i just want to find new [ __ ]

1702
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,359
all the time i mean

1703
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,039
[ __ ] half the time all like i just went

1704
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,400
to california and went to all these big

1705
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:09,759
grows and everything and met up with

1706
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,599
everybody

1707
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,640
except me

1708
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,039
well

1709
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:18,239
everybody um everything is on schedule

1710
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:20,318
but uh

1711
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,078
the like

1712
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,079
the one that i wasn't really

1713
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,720
particularly impressed with was the one

1714
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,079
that all the biggest growers all said

1715
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:29,679
hey can i get a clone what's up with

1716
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,960
that one i wanna i need to i need to

1717
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:35,118
make this one a strain or whatever right

1718
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,119
and it's like well i didn't even think

1719
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,119
that was that out of all the stuff i

1720
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,358
brought that's not my personal favorite

1721
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,079
you know so for me it's like i never

1722
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,480
really know what's [ __ ] i just try to

1723
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,240
grow really good weeds and [ __ ] that i

1724
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,599
think is unique and tastes really good

1725
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,919
and has that

1726
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,440
the right ratios everything we were just

1727
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,639
talking about

1728
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,400
and um

1729
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,879
man everybody i let everybody else

1730
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,200
decide what what's really unique to them

1731
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,519
because if you told me

1732
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,239
you know

1733
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:09,280
10 years that papaya would be unique to

1734
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,078
people i'd tell you you're [ __ ] crazy

1735
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,920
right

1736
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,839
that's the most

1737
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,720
run-of-the-mill [ __ ] on the [ __ ]

1738
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:18,480
planet at that time right yeah but so

1739
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,480
only 10 years later

1740
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,440
you know dutch skunk number one fruit

1741
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,240
terps

1742
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,838
is unique because everyone grows only

1743
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,598
gelato so

1744
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:29,519
yeah yeah if you would have told me

1745
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,200
skunk one would have had a comeback i

1746
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,239
would never in a million years have

1747
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:33,279
believed that

1748
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,838
exactly

1749
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,839
i mean there was there there was a time

1750
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:41,920
you know in mendo where

1751
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:44,318
you couldn't give a a calli pound away

1752
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,798
yeah and then you know and then the the

1753
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:47,838
nails got invented and people started

1754
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:51,280
dabbing

1755
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:53,199
and angie became popular

1756
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,680
but

1757
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:58,000
i couldn't believe tangi when it when it

1758
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,759
hit i was like what what are we redoing

1759
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,519
calio again what the [ __ ] going on

1760
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,599
here right

1761
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:06,960
but but we forget that you know the

1762
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,798
majority of the smoking population is 18

1763
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,480
to 28 years old

1764
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,798
so after

1765
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,960
most people turn 28 they get kids family

1766
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,759
they smoke less they're not involved

1767
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,679
and

1768
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,680
that [ __ ] whatever was

1769
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,358
old for the people that just quit

1770
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,719
smoking is brand new to the next

1771
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,119
generation

1772
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:28,959
yeah i mean we we had a we had a like a

1773
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:31,200
15-year downturn for perps

1774
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,119
and then it came back with a vengeance

1775
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,118
yeah totally with a vengeance you know

1776
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,358
there there was an era a long time ago

1777
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,798
when when everything purple went like

1778
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,639
crazy

1779
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,159
and then that wasn't the case for a

1780
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:43,598
decade and a half or something and then

1781
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,199
it came back

1782
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,640
and all of a sudden

1783
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:50,000
you know i you hear that like very 2005

1784
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,480
statement you know like i don't know if

1785
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,519
this is purple enough could this be

1786
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,760
darker

1787
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,318
you see people extending the periods for

1788
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,640
these strains now by like adding two

1789
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,318
novel things together so you got like

1790
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,838
tropicana cookies and it's like just

1791
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,400
tangy but it's purple like the

1792
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:08,000
blackberry right and it's like that and

1793
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,798
then people are like excited about it

1794
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,798
again you know yeah mendo per same thing

1795
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,880
you know it's like people get tired of

1796
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,038
it when it's just a mental perk but you

1797
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,559
know call it forbidden fruit and now

1798
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,240
it's the hot [ __ ] and now yeah i mean i

1799
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,319
it's crazy

1800
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:27,919
um what's crazy about the forbidden

1801
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:29,838
fruit is that when citrus is strong

1802
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,440
it's like one of the most dumb it can be

1803
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:32,880
it can breed one of the most dominant

1804
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,400
terps at times

1805
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,599
yeah for sure

1806
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,440
you know

1807
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,200
and then it's and it's often a one or

1808
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,880
two note terp

1809
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:42,639
where it's like you don't get other

1810
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,358
scents it's like when it's citrus it's

1811
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,960
just like pop it's citrus

1812
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:48,880
yeah and that forbidden fruit is really

1813
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,280
weird because it smells just like it's

1814
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,798
like a one note purple

1815
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,880
it's a pretty plant

1816
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,038
it's pretty super pretty

1817
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,599
super pretty and like uh and all that

1818
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:03,119
and you know but yeah it's it just it

1819
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,480
smells like if you like orange citrus

1820
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,920
and that's it well

1821
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,039
i think here's uh an important thing to

1822
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,440
i think

1823
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:14,640
what we're talking about is really a

1824
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,798
product of the how easily information is

1825
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,639
spread nowadays because like you were

1826
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:19,599
talking about before

1827
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,519
how

1828
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:26,000
uh plant diseases were isolated to

1829
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,199
small groups of people if if at all

1830
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,838
because people didn't really share

1831
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:32,078
plants the same thing was true with the

1832
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:32,960
selling part of weed 20 years ago as

1833
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,760
well

1834
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,280
is

1835
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:39,039
i don't know what the [ __ ] people were

1836
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,599
smoking in georgia or tennessee right i

1837
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,720
just know what i can buy around me

1838
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,519
that's it

1839
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,239
and

1840
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,920
uh so i didn't have this con this

1841
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,838
preconception that

1842
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,159
i can get some purple weed that smells

1843
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,880
like orange there was not choices like

1844
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:56,239
that so everybody just basically created

1845
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,720
their own

1846
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,759
standards of quality

1847
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,038
and

1848
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,440
preference

1849
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:06,160
and those were localized to even just

1850
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,400
small groups of people right and i think

1851
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:09,118
that's why we had so many unique strains

1852
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,240
that

1853
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:14,318
that

1854
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,399
were able to survive prohibition

1855
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,519
is because the whole market wasn't

1856
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,599
gelato

1857
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,440
or whatever because

1858
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,079
no one had a big enough growth to do

1859
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,519
that no one knew about a strain enough

1860
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,599
to do all that [ __ ] so um

1861
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:32,239
you know every so like strains like hp

1862
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:34,240
13 survived because that was the best

1863
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:35,679
weed that a whole group of people in the

1864
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,838
country could get

1865
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,919
and they demanded that product so that

1866
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,679
clone survived and that

1867
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,318
you know that was one of the benefits of

1868
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:46,639
prohibition is that it actually did help

1869
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,400
keep some of the diversity alive because

1870
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:51,598
you had these independent markets that

1871
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,880
weren't affected from external external

1872
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,359
input

1873
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,838
and now we have the opposite where

1874
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:00,159
everyone is so influenced

1875
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,639
by external input that

1876
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,279
almost no one keeps anything unique

1877
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,798
around anymore at all and the customer

1878
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,720
doesn't even

1879
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:11,358
know that they want it because it's not

1880
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,679
even available in the marketplace

1881
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,598
oh i mean that's something i trip on all

1882
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:18,558
the time is because

1883
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:20,640
like california like in in some degree

1884
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:23,200
like or where i live might be considered

1885
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,358
kind of like a you know the forefront of

1886
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,838
certain things good and bad and one of

1887
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:31,199
the bad things was like the the whole

1888
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:33,440
like named clone craze that took off

1889
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:35,439
where you know first it was purples and

1890
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,760
it was cushes and sours and you know

1891
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,440
just but what that meant is that people

1892
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,520
kept dropping stuff and we talked

1893
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,318
earlier in the show about how

1894
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,280
that g13 cut probably survived in ohio

1895
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:47,599
because

1896
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,880
like you you grow weed in these areas

1897
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,359
where it's good enough weed that it

1898
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,480
always sells and there's not pressure to

1899
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:56,159
change so they keep these favorites

1900
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,119
wherever they go

1901
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:59,920
ohio

1902
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,440
is are they even legal yet or no not

1903
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,358
exactly but i just meant like anywhere

1904
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,159
anywhere that doesn't like california

1905
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:07,519
pressure i mean i'll tell you so to me

1906
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,159
the first real

1907
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:13,038
praise was the purple craze in mendo

1908
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:15,279
before that people just grew good weed

1909
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,760
and it all sold

1910
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,760
right and then when the purple craze hit

1911
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,920
and it became about the mendo p or the

1912
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,839
urkel or the gdp or you know these half

1913
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,200
a dozen different purple strains there

1914
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:27,599
would be people that would come up from

1915
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:31,118
the bay and they were like i will buy

1916
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,440
every gram of this weed that i can find

1917
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,760
yeah and so that created this pressure

1918
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,119
where all these different growers

1919
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,480
were like well why do i want to grow

1920
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,318
this other [ __ ]

1921
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,079
i'm just going to turn this 40 lights or

1922
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,679
whatever into urkel

1923
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,839
and boom it out because these people are

1924
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:46,798
going to cash me out even for my odd

1925
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,199
pound

1926
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:53,358
of course yeah and so with every time

1927
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:55,358
that happens diversity gets [ __ ]

1928
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:57,279
and then you fast forward right fast

1929
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,199
forward 15 years from then

1930
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,519
and when the purple craze hit

1931
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,719
everybody starts hitting up like the six

1932
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:04,719
people that kept purple

1933
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:11,038
you know like everyone i knew had an

1934
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:13,519
urkel or grape ape or uh or a gdp or a

1935
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,680
mendo p cut oh yeah you know there was

1936
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,920
an era after that where like every

1937
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:20,480
single farmer i knew indoor and outdoor

1938
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,880
ran some sour diesel

1939
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:26,318
but if it's not if it's not what's the

1940
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,519
easiest thing to to sell then they drop

1941
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,759
it

1942
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:30,880
you guys feel like we're in that stage

1943
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,200
right now

1944
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,280
currently with anything

1945
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,399
yeah a bunch of shits getting dropped

1946
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,839
yeah

1947
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,160
i mean i'll tell you something crazy

1948
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:41,119
dude i had a buddy from from soham hit

1949
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,000
me up

1950
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,519
and say that a bunch of brokers were

1951
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,119
starting to talk about wanting sour

1952
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,960
diesel this year

1953
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,240
and they couldn't they couldn't find

1954
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,639
clones of sour diesel and soham

1955
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:56,000
weird that is weird because it's been

1956
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,239
three four years and everybody's been

1957
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,318
growing gelatos and weird hybrids of

1958
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,759
gelato and these weird purple crosses

1959
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:02,798
and jealousy and

1960
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,359
you know that was the only thing that

1961
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,880
people wanted to pay for

1962
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:08,719
yeah makes sense you wouldn't think sour

1963
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,559
would get pushed out but

1964
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:13,279
it doesn't take that long all it takes

1965
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,119
is a few seasons or one season

1966
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,319
of your broker telling you i don't want

1967
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,600
it

1968
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,759
and you're gonna find something though

1969
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,520
they they do want

1970
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,198
you know or they tell you oh i'll buy

1971
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,679
that but it's gonna be this but if you

1972
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:28,079
had this i'd pay you this much more

1973
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,838
yeah they're going to go that route

1974
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:32,559
yeah it definitely doesn't have the

1975
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:35,278
cookies appeal at all this isn't you

1976
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,359
know but it's like but everyone had sour

1977
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,920
it's just it's a globalization of the

1978
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,319
marketplace right you know it really

1979
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,600
it's a nationalization but california is

1980
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:47,120
supplying is globally at this point now

1981
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,440
and um

1982
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,679
so it's just like you know kind of when

1983
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,158
you travel the world nowadays right it's

1984
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,079
like it's a lot it's not

1985
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,479
nearly as

1986
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:01,039
culturally diverse especially in the

1987
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:04,238
touristy areas than

1988
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:06,880
20 years ago or in particular 40 years

1989
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:08,399
ago not that i ever experienced that but

1990
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,319
um

1991
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,519
it's just where we have this

1992
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:16,400
information is disseminated so quickly

1993
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,880
nowadays that it's um

1994
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,399
that we're losing a lot of diversity on

1995
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,838
the planet

1996
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:26,238
for a lot of reasons and um

1997
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,039
with cannabis particularly because it

1998
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,439
was

1999
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:31,920
prohibited by the governments

2000
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:35,759
we have probably the very last

2001
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,158
agricultural crop that had its own free

2002
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,119
independent economy

2003
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:41,519
and

2004
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:44,238
um distribution system for a

2005
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,679
multi-billion dollar planet plant per

2006
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,559
year in value

2007
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:51,279
with absolutely zero

2008
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,440
government intervention and policies

2009
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,920
that would dictate how and why people

2010
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,839
would operate their business and now

2011
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,840
i'll move to the whole opposite with

2012
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,319
that with globalization and nationalism

2013
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,840
with one exception to that they didn't

2014
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,559
have any control

2015
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:09,039
over how we set it up except for

2016
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,039
things they did would make us adapt to

2017
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:14,000
not encounter them

2018
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,920
yeah so all the shipping methods all the

2019
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,119
very all the various aspects of the

2020
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,679
business was to work around

2021
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:23,119
government intervention of any kind

2022
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,520
so they didn't really they didn't they

2023
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:28,238
didn't really dictate to us but they did

2024
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,560
influence how we responded in a way

2025
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:32,879
exactly but because of that

2026
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,199
if we had a much more diverse

2027
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,880
scene because everybody figured out a

2028
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,439
different way

2029
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,600
to manipulate the system to their

2030
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:44,719
advantage so to speak right it really

2031
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:47,039
was adam smith and the invisible hand

2032
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,158
sure you guys familiar with that

2033
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,000
no

2034
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,359
so adam smith when he wrote about

2035
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,520
capitalism and all that it's like a

2036
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,519
super famous thing that he did but he

2037
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,440
wrote about basically like real

2038
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,920
capitalism is like there's an invisible

2039
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:01,039
hand that takes the goods from where

2040
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,920
they are

2041
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,439
and pulls them to where they're wanted

2042
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,199
to be bought

2043
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,198
like there's a system that will get set

2044
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,519
up if there's a demand in some place and

2045
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:14,479
there's margin and profit to be made a

2046
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,719
system will be set up by people to get

2047
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,718
that profit and to bring the goods to

2048
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,319
where the people want to be

2049
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,399
yeah that's essentially what happened

2050
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,079
with wheat that's how weed got spread

2051
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,198
all over america when it was totally

2052
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,079
illegal

2053
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,119
was the invisible hand divvied it up

2054
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:30,960
exactly

2055
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:32,800
okay you know and then the invisible

2056
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,039
hand is just it's just no government no

2057
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,719
government making any rules i mean it's

2058
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,000
interesting that like in california

2059
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,520
especially they made a whole bunch of

2060
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,399
rules and they crashed the very

2061
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,480
successful system within five years

2062
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:45,920
but that's exactly what we're getting at

2063
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,759
is that like

2064
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,840
if you let the government get involved

2065
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,159
in anything they will ruin it right

2066
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,279
that's the general

2067
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:57,198
rule of thumb right name one war that

2068
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,960
we've waged in the last 50 years in this

2069
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:01,678
country where we want it

2070
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,319
whether it was a foreign war or a

2071
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,760
domestic war the war on drugs [ __ ] drugs

2072
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:07,759
are more available and more planet

2073
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,158
we don't win any wars war on

2074
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,158
homelessness we don't win anything

2075
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:16,399
i'm not sure if they're meant to be one

2076
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,960
i i really don't know yeah there's no

2077
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,238
profit in solutions yeah exactly that's

2078
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,760
what i mean

2079
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:23,519
it's [ __ ] up

2080
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,360
but there's no profit in collapsing an

2081
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,520
agricultural commodity that you're the

2082
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:29,119
one taxing like the funny part is the

2083
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,280
government's so bad

2084
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:33,119
at their job that they're the only ones

2085
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:35,279
that make money without having to spend

2086
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:37,198
any in this real business you know right

2087
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,119
i mean other than other than just

2088
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,119
enforcing the rules that they that get

2089
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:42,880
written but

2090
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:44,960
they're taking in what a third of the

2091
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,560
income and the whole state or more in

2092
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,760
most of these cases

2093
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,640
and

2094
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,600
and

2095
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,280
the the biggest loser is them

2096
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,199
by collapsing the system around

2097
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:57,759
themselves because

2098
01:12:55,198 --> 01:13:00,639
if the if the price of weed goes to

2099
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,840
basically non-profitable and i mean look

2100
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,400
i've talked about this for a long ass

2101
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:09,360
time

2102
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:11,759
without subsidies and or farmers unions

2103
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,679
farming in america doesn't exist

2104
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,000
you've been doom and gloom forever about

2105
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,158
it i agree yes yes

2106
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,319
but we're here now really no he has he's

2107
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,879
been talking about dairy realities and

2108
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:24,799
collapsing markets and and what happens

2109
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,800
with industrialization and all that for

2110
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,880
quite some time but here's the biggest

2111
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,000
benefit right is because there's no

2112
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,279
union

2113
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,399
and no

2114
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,759
subsidies to get this to survive

2115
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:38,319
that

2116
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,760
the consumption of weeds gonna continue

2117
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,479
so a lot of people are just there's

2118
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,320
nothing to save these big corporations

2119
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:45,359
and these big investment

2120
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,920
firms

2121
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,920
yeah stay in business there's nothing to

2122
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,119
save them right

2123
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,079
and

2124
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,640
in a

2125
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,640
in the right scenario depending on how

2126
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,800
much it ends up costing a lot of these

2127
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,280
big businesses to operate

2128
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,880
and how the consumers

2129
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,960
perception and demands may change

2130
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,000
small farms might be the ones that come

2131
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,079
out winning

2132
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,198
because there isn't

2133
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:15,359
as we're seeing now in california and as

2134
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:17,279
the as every state gets its own supply

2135
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,079
set up and there's not this

2136
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:20,158
um

2137
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,880
distribution network this demand from

2138
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:25,119
all over the world for export product

2139
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,119
yeah

2140
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,760
we're growing way more weed than people

2141
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:31,759
need to smoke so all it takes is the

2142
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,440
consumer demanding a little bit higher

2143
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,480
quality product

2144
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:39,039
um and the consumption amount or the

2145
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:41,599
amount of players being too many for the

2146
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:42,479
amount of consumption that's occurring

2147
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,400
and

2148
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,000
the only things that may be profitable

2149
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,920
is small businesses

2150
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,399
you know you guys did you guys not to

2151
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,880
interrupt did you guys see that thing uh

2152
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:56,879
in canada where they destroyed like

2153
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,079
hundreds of tons of unused weed

2154
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,560
they burned it

2155
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,319
because of overproduction

2156
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,400
yeah and they couldn't pump it through

2157
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,319
the system and it aged out and turned

2158
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,079
brown and you know they had all these

2159
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:10,559
huge greenhouses and they did this big

2160
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,399
power play there's an aspect it's

2161
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,080
interesting that you say that dude

2162
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:16,158
because

2163
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,960
there is definitely a bunch of people

2164
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:21,279
that are trying to get into the industry

2165
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,800
by just having a better burn rate than

2166
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:24,399
small farmers

2167
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,880
what they're hoping to do

2168
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,719
is bleed everybody out

2169
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,800
be able to survive longer because they

2170
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:32,319
have more capital and then take over the

2171
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,840
bones and they end up with a bunch of

2172
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,238
market share

2173
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,640
yeah but what homie is saying is that

2174
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:40,799
they could actually bleed out beyond

2175
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,360
where they're willing to bleed

2176
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,119
exactly and if the price spike doesn't

2177
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:47,920
happen after that

2178
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:49,198
to like be able to recover they're lost

2179
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,279
because what they're trying to do is

2180
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:54,719
they're willing to lose money now but

2181
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:57,279
they're planning on making more later

2182
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,279
and they just the plan is not to just

2183
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:00,880
light a huge pile of money on fire and

2184
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,599
watch it burn

2185
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,159
no they exactly exactly but their

2186
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,120
problem is that now that people are

2187
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:10,079
growing

2188
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:13,039
weed more easily everywhere right and

2189
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:16,158
more quantity of it like i mean oklahoma

2190
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:19,439
has intercepted pick six the whole game

2191
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:21,359
from california in a lot of ways okay

2192
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,039
and that's gonna continue to happen with

2193
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,599
every new state that comes online and it

2194
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:27,039
becomes easy to grow more

2195
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,440
so like you know

2196
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,119
companies like truly even florida

2197
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:32,960
well you've got companies like jungle

2198
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,719
boys and everybody else that can come in

2199
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,279
and take their lunch from them from a

2200
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,439
from a business operations standpoint

2201
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:42,079
and quality perspective and then you've

2202
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:46,000
got the the little small grower chipping

2203
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:48,158
away at you too so i mean like

2204
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,640
the market may not sustain their billion

2205
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,719
dollar aspirations that you may not be

2206
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,880
able to be that big and we're seeing

2207
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,640
that in washington already the biggest

2208
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,359
growers in washington are shutting down

2209
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,400
2 000 light operations they're selling

2210
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,839
200 packaged pounds wreck

2211
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,158
right

2212
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,960
the thousand light grows that bring in

2213
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:11,198
buyers from out of state buy it from the

2214
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,119
from the licensed place

2215
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:14,879
that they deposit cash and the state

2216
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,840
knows about it and it's like

2217
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:22,480
the the supply it's there's so many

2218
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,480
operations to supply the demand now that

2219
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:28,399
i don't think there is like a rosy

2220
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:30,238
outcome for them uh down the road

2221
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,479
so they might just be lighting lighting

2222
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:34,399
tens of millions of dollars on fire well

2223
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:36,718
if they can't find

2224
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,960
more money to keep sustaining their

2225
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,920
money losing operations

2226
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:44,480
it's they're done for anyways i mean you

2227
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,359
know canopy growth shut down their what

2228
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,678
did they spend 230 million dollars on a

2229
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:52,000
greenhouse in medicine hat they sold it

2230
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:55,119
for 35 million recently just to keep the

2231
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,158
lights on i mean like jesus

2232
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,238
you know

2233
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:01,920
you can't run a business like that i

2234
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:04,319
mean no flocana up by me they raised 175

2235
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,199
million bucks

2236
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:09,039
and they they pretty much blew it

2237
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:11,119
right and so where's the ground gonna

2238
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,800
come from when the economics looks the

2239
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,640
way it does now

2240
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,239
yeah and you know and there's another

2241
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,400
aspect of it too and

2242
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,759
uh you you know we were chatting about

2243
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:21,198
this i can't remember it was last week

2244
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,000
or the week before

2245
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:24,319
but

2246
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,880
like it is this weird thing because

2247
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,880
since cannabis is legal in some spots

2248
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,279
and illegal in others

2249
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,760
right and the and the and the line

2250
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:35,439
between the two is super murky

2251
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,079
um there's all this there's all this

2252
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:40,238
stuff happening you know where most of

2253
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,760
the companies in california surviving by

2254
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,678
back dooring

2255
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,760
absolutely you know that's how they're

2256
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:48,158
surviving and then and then on top of

2257
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,440
that like up in you know when the hemp

2258
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:53,119
when the hemp implosion happened in 2018

2259
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:54,799
uh up in his neck of the woods in

2260
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:56,479
southern oregon and all those areas

2261
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,400
those places started growing at a level

2262
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:00,479
never before seen

2263
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:02,479
and there's all these there's all these

2264
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,639
criminal groups and cartels

2265
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:06,639
that started doing things on a scale

2266
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,719
that had never been seen before

2267
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,480
and daring the authorities to come catch

2268
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,640
them

2269
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:15,198
right and so there's massive amounts of

2270
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:18,719
weed that are being grown i've read in

2271
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:22,719
places that that uh you know a mexican

2272
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:25,760
mexican import is down 75

2273
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,640
from from the good days for them

2274
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,360
right

2275
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,640
and

2276
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:29,599
and they

2277
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,119
are

2278
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,640
going into all kinds of different

2279
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,238
businesses to make up that lost revenue

2280
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,280
right and they're going to oklahoma and

2281
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,799
they're going to oregon and they're

2282
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,559
going to the desert in california and

2283
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,920
they're setting up these huge depths and

2284
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,679
shops

2285
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,199
trying to make money

2286
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,319
so it's like a total free-for-all in

2287
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,319
that sense

2288
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,399
you know it's like the the level of

2289
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,719
overproduction is insane

2290
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:54,479
well yeah and everybody thinks that like

2291
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,480
it's gonna get better and it's like look

2292
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,839
for just every person that's quitting

2293
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:59,919
right now there's another person

2294
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,440
doubling up their garden right yeah

2295
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,440
there's another glass house putting up

2296
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:05,439
another five million square feet this

2297
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,319
isn't going to get that much better you

2298
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:09,439
have to identify your own market and

2299
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:11,439
then

2300
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:14,158
supply that market whatever it is that

2301
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,759
you do whether it's edibles vape pens

2302
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:18,158
these terp carts

2303
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,600
rosin pick your pick your thing maybe

2304
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:20,479
it's all of them it doesn't really

2305
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,199
matter

2306
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:25,439
but the market can only sustain so much

2307
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:27,759
of that right before

2308
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:31,359
you start basically eating into your own

2309
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,679
profits with your over production so

2310
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:36,639
like i said as more people become

2311
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:38,560
operational more good operators come in

2312
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:42,239
more good black market operators

2313
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,239
continue to produce in more states um

2314
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:47,279
maybe it fizzles out for them you know

2315
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:49,198
who knows

2316
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,559
maybe it just can't sustain the size of

2317
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:52,559
business that they want like these

2318
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,560
people spent 300 million dollars

2319
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,400
building this big grow because they were

2320
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,760
planning on doing a billion dollars a

2321
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,158
year in sales

2322
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,079
but they only got to 150 million a year

2323
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,079
in sales they're not really breaking

2324
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:05,600
bulls right so

2325
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:06,960
um i think that's going to be the

2326
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,120
reality for a lot of these big

2327
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,158
businesses and then

2328
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:11,920
if you get these really big

2329
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:13,119
overproduction situations like you have

2330
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,719
right now

2331
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:16,719
um

2332
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,399
you're gonna see people shutting lights

2333
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,239
off but the thing is is like as soon as

2334
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:22,000
the the um

2335
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,678
like all right let's say you have a 2000

2336
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,760
light operation and you're gonna shut it

2337
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:27,840
down for the time being

2338
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,600
because you have two of these let's say

2339
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,119
you shut one down

2340
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,719
and you're like well we'll just wait

2341
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,399
till the price goes back up well what

2342
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,920
happens when the price goes back up you

2343
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,519
flip the lights back on fill it with

2344
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,440
plants and a year later the price is

2345
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,520
back where it was again

2346
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:44,238
yeah this is you know

2347
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,440
ag economics you know this is just how

2348
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,399
it goes

2349
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:47,599
and

2350
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:49,519
so

2351
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,920
the real question is how much coveted

2352
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,480
cash did we spend on

2353
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,800
growth that don't need to exist

2354
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,399
and if that's yeah really big which i

2355
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,560
think it is

2356
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,638
this over production will continue for

2357
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,800
quite some time i would think

2358
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,639
i mean really it's it's two giants with

2359
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,159
a bunch of good weed growers getting

2360
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,279
smashed in the middle

2361
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:14,000
in my opinion because it's like all the

2362
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:15,840
like the two giants are like the all the

2363
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,920
huge black market things that have set

2364
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,840
up by the various groups and then the

2365
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,199
other giant is all the backdoor legal

2366
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,279
weed that happens

2367
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:25,359
and the reason why legal is so pissed at

2368
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:27,119
the black market is because for the

2369
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:28,719
first two three years they were dumping

2370
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:32,000
all their excess product in the black

2371
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:33,039
easy and that was their cash flow

2372
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,639
and now

2373
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,560
now they're getting cut off by these

2374
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,719
ginormous scenes and they're pissed off

2375
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,880
about it and it's tanking their price

2376
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,800
and it's making their life harder but

2377
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,719
but you know so they want they want all

2378
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,320
the black to be shut down

2379
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,480
but they only want the black to be shut

2380
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:50,880
down so they could resupply the black

2381
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,119
they just lost market share

2382
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,119
you

2383
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,360
they just need market share wherever

2384
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,079
they're going to get it from well they

2385
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:03,279
define what's white and what's black so

2386
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:05,198
i mean they're the ones hiring the

2387
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:06,399
lobbyists and are going to be hiring the

2388
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:09,279
lobbyists so they don't find what's

2389
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:11,759
white and black anyways i you know i i

2390
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:13,279
worked on some on on some big farms down

2391
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,800
in southern california for a couple of

2392
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,399
years and uh

2393
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,920
one of the things that the sales guy did

2394
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:19,920
that was pretty trippy is he went and he

2395
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,760
looked at a bunch of the data for all of

2396
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,760
the dispensaries

2397
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,840
and he was pretty much like you know

2398
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,159
this farm that we have down here it

2399
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:31,440
could probably supply like 80 or 90

2400
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:33,439
percent of the volume needed

2401
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:35,279
and he was like kind of from the the

2402
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,279
real world so he was kind of tripping

2403
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:39,039
out by this number because he didn't

2404
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,920
know all the various nuances that we

2405
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:41,840
know

2406
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,279
you know but he was just looking at it

2407
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,159
he was thinking about all the other

2408
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,599
bigger farms than us and all the indoors

2409
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:48,960
and all the depths and all the

2410
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,440
everything else and he was like well how

2411
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,119
is this working

2412
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:57,119
the only way that the white market can

2413
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:59,039
survive is if like 80 of them fail

2414
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:01,439
if you're if they actually have to sell

2415
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:04,639
within the state of california only and

2416
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:06,319
no back door exactly yeah and then the

2417
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,639
goal would be instead of like two or

2418
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,399
three huge companies that suck that that

2419
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,159
percentage would be a bunch of bomb

2420
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:14,158
small growers that could actually give

2421
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:16,319
consumers what they want well that's

2422
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:18,559
what i'm getting at is that yeah the

2423
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:20,719
market actually shrinks back to the size

2424
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,480
that it's that's actually sustainable

2425
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,480
for the state of california and not

2426
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:26,479
including the export market

2427
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,759
the most of these big growers are too

2428
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,559
big for that

2429
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:32,560
like they're they just can't get enough

2430
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,000
revenue to sustain the business model so

2431
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,560
they they have two choices they either

2432
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,238
just shut off a bunch of operations and

2433
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,000
keep their 200 million a year or

2434
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:41,279
whatever it is they could get

2435
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,880
or

2436
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,039
and they just hope they can hold on to

2437
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,199
that from little guys that keep chopping

2438
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:49,119
at their at their bottom line or at the

2439
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:51,039
top line so

2440
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:53,359
you know it this may go back the other

2441
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:55,840
direction and people don't realize that

2442
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:57,759
and i think if people focus on quality

2443
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,880
expanding their market instead of

2444
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,600
chopping off your fellow farmers market

2445
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,159
the

2446
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,159
black market operators or backdoor

2447
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,279
operators or whoever you are

2448
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,198
you're gonna

2449
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:10,800
continue to see growth in your space

2450
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,879
regardless

2451
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,520
that'd be my that's my opinion

2452
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,440
i could even say 20 years ago the people

2453
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,440
that i knew that were running 50 and 100

2454
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:20,479
lighters that were really good at their

2455
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:22,719
job

2456
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,439
they still bought their head stash from

2457
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,960
4 to 10 to 12 lighters

2458
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:30,000
because those that there's just

2459
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,600
something about like a a smaller space

2460
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,880
that only per they don't you know like

2461
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,400
you can you can

2462
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,920
there's like

2463
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:39,279
nobody agrees where craft ends

2464
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,119
right

2465
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:43,198
nobody nobody agrees when it's like it's

2466
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:45,039
just a little too big to be called craft

2467
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:47,678
but i can but everybody agrees that the

2468
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:50,319
bigger it gets the harder it becomes

2469
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,199
to manage perfect weed

2470
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:53,039
you know

2471
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:54,879
a guy that like works on his four

2472
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:56,479
lighter after work and is in love with

2473
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,079
it and spends a couple hours in there

2474
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:00,399
every night making it just exactly

2475
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,119
perfect he probably has fire well i

2476
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,479
think as these as this profit margin

2477
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,479
continues to shrink and then you got

2478
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:08,479
these big monster grows

2479
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,039
i think you're going to continue to find

2480
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:13,599
it's going to be continued

2481
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:16,079
to be difficult for these big businesses

2482
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,520
to find employees that want to do that

2483
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:18,800
[ __ ] too

2484
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,679
right i mean where are you getting

2485
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:24,159
skilled workers from in this marketplace

2486
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,639
and my my buddy dude uh he jokes that

2487
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:28,960
like it's like a [ __ ] factory job

2488
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:31,119
it is and you're in there and the lights

2489
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,600
are on and the fans are running and the

2490
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:36,000
decibels are loud and you honestly

2491
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,000
should have like protective glasses and

2492
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,800
some and some that you know and some ear

2493
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,639
muffs and some this is a good team it's

2494
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,079
it's actually pretty fun because now you

2495
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,159
don't have to man it you don't have to

2496
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:48,158
be the guy like growing weed for

2497
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,399
yourself is being that guy that's

2498
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:52,319
playing the the he's got the whole

2499
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:54,799
contraption on that's playing like fixed

2500
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:56,479
[ __ ] yeah yeah right

2501
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,480
like that what the

2502
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,559
running and operating the whole business

2503
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,718
itself is that and for some people

2504
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,400
that's the right way to do it and if you

2505
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,560
want to control your product and your

2506
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:09,759
market and your marketplace that's how

2507
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:11,679
you do it but these big monster grows

2508
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,360
especially when the ownership has no

2509
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:15,119
soul or passion for the plant and

2510
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:17,920
doesn't want to fund any kind of fun

2511
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,359
[ __ ] for their employees to do in it

2512
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,960
yeah i don't think you're going to find

2513
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,519
a lot of people that want to continue to

2514
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,560
do that job long term

2515
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,800
yeah

2516
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:29,679
and i i mean there's there's an aspect

2517
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:32,480
too where um and i want to say it before

2518
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,800
i forget but when he was talking about

2519
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:36,319
quality the other thing that i would say

2520
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,039
that is actually going to lead to like

2521
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:41,279
the next generation of like real elites

2522
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:43,119
is if people want to breed

2523
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:45,279
uh stop breeding for the market because

2524
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:47,119
that's going to change soon anyway start

2525
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,840
breeding weed that you personally think

2526
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,760
is fire exactly try to find weed that

2527
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,600
you and your friends love to smoke and

2528
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,920
you love the buzz and you love things

2529
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,840
about it grow better weed for yourself

2530
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,719
the chances of that weed becoming

2531
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:03,039
popular is way better than you trying to

2532
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:05,520
create something that you think will be

2533
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:07,119
popular grow weed you like

2534
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,360
breed

2535
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:12,719
my only business card and everybody that

2536
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:15,439
knows me is a box of jars that's what i

2537
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:17,920
show up with yeah i'm not gonna

2538
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:20,158
hit but a box of jars right and then you

2539
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,158
can because i can tell you pretty much

2540
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:23,198
everything about a grower from a box of

2541
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:26,399
jars

2542
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:27,839
yeah you could you should be able to

2543
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,599
you know and there and there's an aspect

2544
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,880
to where it's it's

2545
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,560
i mean we haven't even talked about like

2546
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,239
if it went federally legal like the

2547
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,120
international market and how that would

2548
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:36,238
play

2549
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:37,840
into

2550
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,718
all this different stuff

2551
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,400
you know because in each new in each new

2552
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,000
state that goes legal

2553
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:45,759
there's a bunch of investment money

2554
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,279
hoping to like dominate and make a bunch

2555
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,800
of money back

2556
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:50,319
and it's kind of been swinging around

2557
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,840
the country right now it's in new york

2558
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:53,599
and new jersey

2559
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,279
because those are huge places that are

2560
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,679
coming online and all these people are

2561
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:00,319
super excited about trying to you know

2562
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,079
do that you know washington where he

2563
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:03,920
he's up you know washington oregon were

2564
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:05,920
ahead of california

2565
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,158
and we didn't really learn any lessons

2566
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,440
no we just we just would [ __ ] the bed

2567
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:11,439
right away we're just like oh let's just

2568
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:14,319
make a bunch of terrible rules

2569
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,079
right away destined for failure

2570
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:17,840
but i mean that's that may only make

2571
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:19,119
sense for california with how we do

2572
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,920
stuff so

2573
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:25,198
yeah i mean i it's it's hard i will say

2574
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,319
in all honesty it's hard because like he

2575
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:28,719
said

2576
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,799
this is it's agricultural which has its

2577
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:33,760
own weird [ __ ] to it right

2578
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,840
um and it's a multi-multi multi-billion

2579
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,360
dollar industry already

2580
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,520
yeah so it's not like they get to create

2581
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:42,000
the industry from the ground up and like

2582
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,480
tinker with it they're trying to bring

2583
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,719
this huge thing

2584
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,399
into the light

2585
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,760
and they have no idea how to do it what

2586
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:50,719
other thing have they ever done that

2587
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,480
with

2588
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,679
yeah that's a good point what have they

2589
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:55,119
ever done

2590
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,560
you know that's why that's why some of

2591
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,639
this money is so excited they're like

2592
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,600
what do you mean there's eight million

2593
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,440
pot smokers in my state already

2594
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,280
yeah that's a huge customer base most

2595
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,399
things you you make that are brand new

2596
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:11,279
you have to build popularity oh yeah

2597
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:13,759
weed is super [ __ ] popular

2598
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,679
like it's already popular so and no one

2599
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,639
controls it so it's all tempting for the

2600
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:19,600
money to be like i want to control that

2601
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,560
for sure

2602
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,800
you know

2603
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:26,000
and i agree rings uh yeah i think

2604
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:29,360
colorado probably was falling out uh

2605
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,279
for cali yeah oregon too i mean uh

2606
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,039
i was just like i've been going through

2607
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:35,679
having to delete all my old photos to

2608
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:38,079
keep my [ __ ] from getting uh

2609
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:39,760
my account deleted and everything yeah

2610
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:42,639
and like man i was i was like seeing

2611
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:44,000
memes i was making in like 2017-18 when

2612
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,639
everybody was talking about the sky is

2613
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,719
falling and [ __ ] in oregon i mean

2614
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,400
this is just reality for an agricultural

2615
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,439
crop and if you're not prepared for it

2616
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:52,879
and for

2617
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,719
um being

2618
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,159
flexible with how you're gonna operate

2619
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,679
your business

2620
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:59,198
it's not gonna be it's not gonna be a

2621
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,000
good time you know

2622
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:02,879
yeah

2623
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,039
one thing i will say too and i never

2624
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,000
really thought that i i i would see this

2625
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:07,920
but

2626
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,279
there's an aspect where like maybe for

2627
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,520
the first time

2628
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:13,759
like being an actual weed nerd who

2629
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,199
really loves it is an advantage

2630
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,560
because then at least you get to love

2631
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:17,919
what you're doing

2632
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,280
where a lot of people got into this

2633
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,039
because it was easy or because it was

2634
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:23,039
money or because there was a big margin

2635
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:25,198
or because you know it allowed them

2636
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,560
travel freedom or whatever and as as it

2637
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:28,000
gets harder and harder they don't

2638
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,920
actually like doing what they're doing

2639
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,520
so they get a lot more frustrated as the

2640
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,760
market changes on them

2641
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,520
yeah this is just another job

2642
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,520
you know yeah it's just you know and

2643
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,120
they used to make a lot more for a lot

2644
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,960
less effort

2645
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,719
and now they're making a lot less for a

2646
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,000
lot more effort

2647
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,840
you know where and there's not there's

2648
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,079
an aspect that i see in mendo all the

2649
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,239
time you probably see it up there too in

2650
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:52,319
oregon you know where it's like a bunch

2651
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:54,000
of people that didn't really care about

2652
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:55,439
weed but learned enough to make money

2653
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,600
and run some big [ __ ] and make good

2654
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:59,678
money for 20 years

2655
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,199
now that it's going legal they think

2656
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,880
they have this like lifetime of

2657
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,960
knowledge about wheat

2658
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,639
but they really farmed most of it out

2659
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,158
and they were in it for luke and so

2660
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,159
they're really not that talented at what

2661
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:12,559
they do they really don't have the same

2662
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:14,879
knowledge base as like people that were

2663
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:17,120
nerdy about lead and kept wanting to

2664
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,119
learn about what they were into

2665
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:21,439
yeah of course so there's an aspect out

2666
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:24,238
there where for you know like being

2667
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:27,519
being like into weed helps because it's

2668
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:29,678
gonna get rough yeah

2669
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,040
it's gonna get rough the combo did go

2670
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,158
sideways but sometimes that's what's

2671
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:33,760
cool about it i mean we could have

2672
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:35,439
talked about hash plants for the last

2673
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,000
hour i suppose

2674
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:40,879
in sequential order

2675
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,039
you know i mean man who [ __ ] cares

2676
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:46,400
yeah i enjoyed it [ __ ] joints here

2677
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:48,560
what the [ __ ] do you guys want yeah

2678
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:51,119
what are you [ __ ] bothering us for

2679
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:53,679
yeah it is i mean to bring it back to

2680
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:55,760
hash plants or whatever probably in the

2681
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,399
probably in the last five or six years

2682
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,960
as people started measuring returns

2683
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:03,279
on on on plants

2684
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,960
uh people started making hash seriously

2685
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:06,800
for the first time in america on a

2686
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,719
commercial scale

2687
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,840
and trying to figure out what cultivars

2688
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:14,158
and actually breeding for hash

2689
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,840
which really wasn't done in the 80s 90s

2690
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:17,519
2000s right

2691
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,560
nobody really people were breeding for

2692
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,239
flower

2693
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,320
yeah for the most part you know people

2694
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,879
weren't breeding for hash i can't

2695
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:27,279
imagine well especially frozen hash

2696
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,359
which is you know arguably some of the

2697
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,719
tastiest hash for sure yeah they didn't

2698
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:32,399
have the gear

2699
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,079
i mean americans like it easy we don't

2700
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,920
have like a village that we can just be

2701
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:38,479
like all right for the next 12 hours all

2702
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:42,000
you families you're you're like bashing

2703
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:43,198
weed over a screen with no with no mask

2704
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,039
you know

2705
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:46,799
you watch some of those you watch you

2706
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,319
watch some of those uh some of those

2707
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,600
videos of what those guys do and i don't

2708
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:52,079
know how they don't have an allergy

2709
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,280
attack like every day of their life

2710
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:57,439
because they're just in a [ __ ] house

2711
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:59,198
oh yeah pounding they beat all [ __ ]

2712
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:00,879
beat allergies moved out and did

2713
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:01,839
something different yeah they had to

2714
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,239
leave

2715
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,600
they had these are desensitized people

2716
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:07,839
because it's just a dust cloud you're

2717
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,159
working in all day long exactly if you

2718
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,639
can't deal with it you're not living in

2719
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:14,319
morocco but the same thing is true too

2720
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,560
where it's like there's a big push where

2721
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:18,238
like a lot of the popular hash trains

2722
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,080
they probably get popular because they

2723
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:21,919
yield great not because they're the best

2724
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:23,760
higher flavor

2725
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,359
yeah there's always that pressure too

2726
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,280
there's the money versus quality

2727
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:29,439
pressure

2728
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:33,039
i don't know number one was one of the

2729
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:34,719
best hash plants for me ever right skunk

2730
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:36,719
number one and it's hybrids from

2731
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,639
amsterdam why because

2732
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,239
sam bred the ship for

2733
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,760
making hash

2734
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:42,718
he's a resin farmer

2735
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,560
yeah

2736
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,198
hit like he

2737
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:51,280
made the money that he made

2738
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:53,439
by breeding a plant for 97 thc in the

2739
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:57,039
trichome head and then selling that as

2740
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,919
technology to gw pharmaceuticals like

2741
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:00,000
that

2742
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,600
that's his that's his claim to fame

2743
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,639
right there and he's like the only one

2744
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,719
that's

2745
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,400
done that even and he did that [ __ ] back

2746
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,118
in the 90s i mean

2747
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,399
you know that it's an impressive feat

2748
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:12,399
regardless

2749
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:13,439
yeah every it's something every breeder

2750
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:15,519
should be

2751
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:17,198
but made a lot of

2752
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,440
you know the netter hash and everything

2753
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:20,879
else that became popular and now is the

2754
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:22,559
water hash market

2755
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,039
i mean we were talking we were talking

2756
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,039
to uh camara a while ago and he was

2757
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:28,800
talking about how's never even seen sam

2758
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:30,479
smoke flower

2759
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,760
that he you know he breeds he's a

2760
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:33,279
resident that's what he called him he's

2761
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,039
a resin farmer

2762
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:36,639
yeah i don't like he does he likes to

2763
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,000
breed for resin that's what he's after

2764
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,520
that's what he's interested in that's

2765
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,560
what he cares about

2766
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,800
you know

2767
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,639
that's pretty dope that's my um bubble

2768
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,360
man doesn't smoke flower either it's

2769
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:48,880
kind of the same mentality

2770
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:50,399
not that dressing

2771
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,800
but you know

2772
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:54,960
i consider sour diesel the diesel family

2773
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,520
to basically be like america's modern

2774
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,118
skunk

2775
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:02,480
yeah you know that

2776
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:05,599
a very skunk oid you know type type you

2777
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:06,959
know plant type aromas all that it's a

2778
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,520
little different it's definitely not

2779
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:12,639
skunk one but it's definitely like it's

2780
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,960
in that family yeah it's modern skunk i

2781
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:17,920
mean even just chem family stuff in

2782
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,198
general is i would almost say is pretty

2783
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,679
similar you know

2784
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:24,799
yeah big tall running colos on a lot of

2785
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:26,960
hybrids a little bit longer flowering

2786
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,960
hybrid plant and

2787
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,760
you know synonymous with

2788
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,239
you know good quality and uh commercial

2789
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,280
production

2790
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:38,399
yeah

2791
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:40,238
only women and slaves smoke flower

2792
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,319
that's one of my favorite quotes ever it

2793
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:44,158
is it's really funny quote

2794
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:45,840
it's a really it wasn't yeah that was

2795
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:48,319
one of the dudes

2796
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,639
funny story i guess

2797
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:52,880
when sam skunk man was in amster was in

2798
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,600
afghanistan looking for seeds

2799
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,000
he asked some of the muhajdin for for

2800
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,800
flour because he wanted the seeds

2801
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,359
and the guy looked at him and was like

2802
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,119
only women and slaves smoke flour

2803
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:06,719
men smoke hash

2804
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,559
and he was basically like are you a

2805
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,399
woman or a slave

2806
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,400
and he had to explain that he wanted the

2807
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:14,399
seeds from the flower he had no interest

2808
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:17,039
in the flower to smoke whatsoever but he

2809
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:18,879
wanted to make his own hash at home

2810
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:20,238
and he wanted the seeds and that made

2811
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,880
sense to the dude but he was literally

2812
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:24,959
like women and slaves smoke flower

2813
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,600
men smoke hashish so he handed them a

2814
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,600
pair of chains

2815
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,719
i mean culturally they're very different

2816
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,119
you know

2817
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:35,369
for sure i get it very different well

2818
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:37,439
it's an unprocessed product you know

2819
01:37:35,369 --> 01:37:38,880
[Music]

2820
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:41,118
and [ __ ] i mean

2821
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,520
if i was if you just

2822
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:47,039
if you just grow a field of seed plants

2823
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,560
and randomly pick a flower to smoke

2824
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:49,840
it's probably not the greatest

2825
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,360
experience

2826
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,319
no

2827
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:55,920
no especially if the flower wasn't ever

2828
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:57,519
bred for smoke

2829
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,600
exactly like one of the one of the

2830
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,119
things about sativas is at least the

2831
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,679
like you know they were breeding for the

2832
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:05,920
flower itself to be smoked

2833
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:08,079
i mean one thing i find interesting that

2834
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,520
everybody you always see this comment

2835
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:11,039
it's kind of a

2836
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,840
um

2837
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,000
a misconception in cannabis breeding is

2838
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:18,159
that oh just go back to land race and

2839
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,600
it'll fix whatever problem someone's

2840
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:22,479
talking about like

2841
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,079
i'll always hear me nowadays because of

2842
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,198
this and this and that

2843
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:27,439
you should just

2844
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,678
go back back to the land race yeah get

2845
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,839
and make something new and it's like

2846
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:33,760
if you've ever grown lots of land raised

2847
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:36,560
varieties

2848
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:39,039
sativa indica everything in between i've

2849
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,080
grown tons of seeds from all over the

2850
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:41,359
world

2851
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:42,880
and

2852
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:45,599
guaranteed

2853
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:48,159
the vast majority of them have equal or

2854
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,920
higher amounts of hermaphroditism

2855
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:52,399
like you know the plants when you grow

2856
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,719
them from seed and the flower's seedless

2857
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:55,599
but it has those little tiny black like

2858
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:56,960
doughs

2859
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,239
and you like roll a joint up and it's

2860
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,480
like all these little black specks on

2861
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:02,479
the table right i've looked at them

2862
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,158
under a microscope it's i mean it

2863
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:07,198
literally it sounds like you have spider

2864
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:10,158
mites in your in your flower but it's

2865
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:12,638
i mean they're they're tiny

2866
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,719
um those are really common do you know

2867
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:17,039
the rosters pick those out

2868
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:20,880
tiny trichome head or tiny trichome

2869
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:21,840
heads and tiny calyxes i mean or bracks

2870
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,239
yeah

2871
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,800
it's like the majority of what's in the

2872
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:29,359
populations is those type of plants now

2873
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,679
the rest of them can be really nice a

2874
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:34,479
lot of them it smells good as really

2875
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:37,440
greasy as potent when you smoke it but

2876
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:41,198
the flower itself is just not desirable

2877
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:43,839
has lots of growth problems as well yeah

2878
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:46,158
land race is like whipping yourself

2879
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:48,079
it's definitely setting it's definitely

2880
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:51,439
a lot it's pain

2881
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:54,639
it's pain it's turning back the clock

2882
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:56,879
and and then you if you if you think

2883
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,400
that that's the way to fix a population

2884
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,319
or something like that

2885
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,319
it's basically you assuming that hey i'm

2886
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,158
going to turn back the clock 50 years

2887
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,559
and i'm going to do this myself from

2888
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:08,638
scratch and do a better job than all the

2889
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,560
people that have done it between me and

2890
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,400
now and it's like dude

2891
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,320
we're just like that there was a decent

2892
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:17,118
population of plants for all of us to

2893
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:19,439
start with in the first place you know

2894
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:21,920
and it's like the the goal is to at

2895
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:23,599
least make hybrids and select for plants

2896
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,679
that'll continue to increase that

2897
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,600
quality so that the next person that

2898
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,800
does that that

2899
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,639
that again

2900
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,400
will continue to improve the population

2901
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:34,480
better than you did and that's

2902
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:37,599
that's inadvertently how we've gotten to

2903
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:39,678
where we are with all the herms all the

2904
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,840
feminized pollinate accidental feminized

2905
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:44,000
pollination that gives us our main

2906
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,079
breeding population of today

2907
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,520
is because it was always the best plants

2908
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:51,039
crossed with the best plants because no

2909
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,480
one kept anything else for the most part

2910
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:54,399
yeah we've gotten this question a few

2911
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:57,359
times so i'll ask it what's up with your

2912
01:40:54,399 --> 01:41:01,039
malawi uh what's the sourcing on that

2913
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:01,920
that came from uh the glassine up here

2914
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,639
in

2915
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:08,000
washington but by way of oregon

2916
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:10,560
very cool um i don't know anything about

2917
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:15,198
who popped the seeds i mean or how it

2918
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:19,920
got here or anything yeah super um

2919
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:24,079
super like land race like uh al uh

2920
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:25,279
obsolete used it right uh

2921
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:27,519
um

2922
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:29,039
i think caleb had it at one point i

2923
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,840
think um

2924
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:34,000
shot 707 seed bank had it for sure and

2925
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,039
ran it after from back in the day i mean

2926
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,359
it was

2927
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,679
it was one of those plants that had a

2928
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:39,679
really

2929
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,360
strong

2930
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,839
like hazy aroma when you smoked the

2931
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:47,439
flower

2932
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:50,560
interesting somebody said more like

2933
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:52,238
eugene gold

2934
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,320
what's that i don't know when they were

2935
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:55,839
talking about malawi

2936
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:58,238
maybe that was another name someone

2937
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,239
called it

2938
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,519
well yeah we talked earlier about like

2939
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,679
the weird instagram stuff and everything

2940
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,119
that's been going on uh one thing we're

2941
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:08,480
trying to put together that was going to

2942
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:09,439
talk about tonight real quick before

2943
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:11,599
we're done

2944
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:13,919
is that we're trying to put together

2945
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:16,719
the breeder syndicate social and i know

2946
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,920
like i think fletchy you saw flanbelle's

2947
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,800
social thing he was trying to put

2948
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,639
together

2949
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,960
we're going to use that similar type

2950
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:25,679
platform so we can have

2951
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:28,719
a nerd ig for us

2952
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:30,239
so we'll figure it out but i wanted to

2953
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,158
at least get that out there today so

2954
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:33,439
people have an idea to look for it

2955
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:34,559
for sure

2956
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:37,839
yeah

2957
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,280
uh anything you're dropping soon fletch

2958
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,560
well maybe i don't know but i'm not

2959
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:43,359
gonna plug [ __ ] on here we're just

2960
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,520
talking we

2961
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:46,479

no i mean i i i obviously had a pretty

2965
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:53,599
wide-ranging conversation sometimes it's

2966
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:55,759

2969
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:02,719

01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,560
it was like 90 80 90 days probably

2971
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,880
