[Music]

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,160
all of a sudden I just started

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,399
questioning everything I'd ever been

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,399
told

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:27,059
and by the time by the

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:31,098
by the very first time

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,098
when it started to hit me

9
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,659
and I'm like wow

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,200
[Applause]

11
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:39,199
I got high

12

[Music]

13
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,179
all right so we wanted to start

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,179
um an episode talking about the Forum

15
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,679
era because I I was a part of the Forum

16
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,659
era but you guys were a part of

17
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,159
different forums than I was on so you

18
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,738
had a lot of interactions with different

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,359
characters and a lot of them are um you

20
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:02,218
know kind of legendary dudes and and

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,079
you've had interactions with guys that

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,400
are really really good archivists that I

23
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,978
I have not had the pleasure of

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,780
interacting with so I wanted you both to

25
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:11,340
kind of talk about your introduction to

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,219
the forums I mean it's going to be two

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,780
different uh stories so uh Rahul you

28
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,819
want to start what was your introduction

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,259
to the forums

30
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:24,359
uh you know early 2000s I I discovered

31
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,400
that people had started using the

32
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:32,879
internet for weed and I was shocked

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,159
you can imagine right I mean I'd I'd

34
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,618
um anyway I I looked around I was doing

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,380
a business trip out to Amsterdam and and

36
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,180
I I knew that's where the weed was so I

37
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,459
figured I should try this new tool and

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,560
try and find stuff about coffee shops

39
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,078
and stuff and and

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,019
um you know that was basically it I was

41
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,019
scared I was scared to be on any site

42
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:58,078
that talked about weed back then

43
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:02,099
um you know the early 2000s were time

44
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:05,298
before proxy uh servers were out there

45
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:08,459
and so you know having having anonymity

46
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,099
of any kind on the web was really a

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,259
pretty fuzzy idea for for most people

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,738
and you know a lot of people just went

49
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,139
up there boldly you know um with a you

50
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,360
know fake name and and keeping their

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,579
fingers crossed that nobody's gonna put

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,400
a sniffer on the line and start tracking

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,340
traffic and grabbing IPS but you know it

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,760
really wouldn't be it was you know just

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,819
painfully simple for for tech people to

56
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,639
to really get some useful information

57
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,598
back then if they wanted to

58
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,899
um

59
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,518
you know I finally got over my fear and

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,180
said you know screw it I'm going up

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,120
there and uh my my Landing

62
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,739
uh spot of choice was Mr Nice so I've

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,099
been I've been kind of looking at

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,259
different forums out there for

65
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,419
um you know the community how people

66
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:03,539
treated each other the knowledge level

67
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,059
you know figured it out real quick that

68
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,000
a lot of these places were organized

69
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,199
around specific companies so that they

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,158
were you know they were just the

71
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,719
marketing uh communication site for

72
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,459
their customers and and the company

73
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,739
themselves and but you know there was

74
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,700
bias in every one of these places and

75
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,099
sure

76
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,979
Mr Nice had a great you know had a great

77
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,139
story about you know this is straight

78
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,079
the original stuff from Neville you know

79
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,000
in a world of imitators we got the

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,219
original stuff and we're the only place

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,860
that still makes it the way they they

82
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,500
always were co-signed by Howard marks

83
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,700
too uh Howard marks right and and you

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,620
know who had nothing to do with the

85
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,719
Neville you know back doing that stuff

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,420
but but you know I mean super cool guy

87
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,199
in you know R.I.P we we don't miss him

88
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:55,318
but um yeah I mean you know it was the

89
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,878
best story out there and and uh what I

90
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,518
didn't realize is that there were like

91
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,919
Wars going on between these between

92
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,980
these different forums for the different

93
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,619
companies you know Scentsy Mr Nice had

94
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,840
had people who were going on like rate

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,819
what appeared to be like raiding parties

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,799
to other people's forums going and

97
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,019
posting a bunch of troll noise and

98
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,019
stirring up trouble then running away

99
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,298
you know it was the equivalent of of you

100
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,220
know kids at a school dance you know

101
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,918
afraid to go talk to the girls on the

102
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,259
other side of the but you know they were

103
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,839
all defending their their Legends you

104
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,720
know their myths that that you know the

105
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:37,258
story The the foundation story between

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,900
our seed lines is cooler and and older

107
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,300
than the founder Foundation story for

108
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,000
your old seed lines and you know that's

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,180
really nothing's changed you know in in

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
20 years with that regard

111
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,879
you know the story cell pictures cell

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,100
you know just now before all we had to

113
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,899
worry about was the story being a lie

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,979
but now these days I mean the pictures

115
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,138
are

116
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:03,180
geez man it's like they don't even need

117
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,340
a plant to start with by the time they

118
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,639
start photoshopping everything up like

119
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,859
that yeah I mean with AI that's actually

120
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,100
a thing now like the AI can develop

121
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,419
cannabis plants so all these guys like

122
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,759
they don't really even have to put any

123
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:21,539
effort into testing really oh you need a

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,120
new picture here AI done yeah you know

125
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,259
so I don't know I mean Mr Nice was a

126
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,800
great place

127
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,600
um you know the these it's volatile up

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,520
there you're dealing with people who are

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,060
you know taking a chance with their

130
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:38,579
their safety and and uh you know their

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,860
livelihoods and by posting up there on

132
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,779
the on the internet trying to make a

133
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,538
connection with somebody else who you

134
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:48,359
know who's into the same stuff they are

135
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:50,759
and it's uh you know sometimes people

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,220
get really stressed out

137
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,319
um they they start worrying and getting

138
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,479
paranoid about their security up there

139
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,639
and you see people just kind of flip out

140
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,579
and run away

141
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,060
um you know it happens it happens even

142
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:09,180
today oh yeah you know

143
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,120
but um yeah Mr Nice was great I I know

144
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,780
that most most Old-Timers were up on

145
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,079
overgrow and and cannabis world and some

146
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:22,138
of these other forms I I came in right

147
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,418
when overgrow was about to get raided so

148
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,280
I was like yeah I started sniffing

149
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:29,099
around I was like hey maybe this is it

150
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,619
maybe this is the time yeah right right

151
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,020
I almost signed up I might have even

152
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,300
created a profile just before just

153
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,180
before they got raided I'm not yeah

154

technology or how it was tracked and I

168
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,879
always felt like it was a risk and so I

169
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,159
was sort of like scared to look at

170
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,439
overgrow in cannabis world but I was

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,720
also like a a fly to Honey or something

172
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,579
like I couldn't resist so yeah I just

173
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,380
tried to avoid like trading or doing

174
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,079
business on there or like telling too

175
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,598
much about my personal life because like

176
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,339
I remember like to speak of of Mr Nice

177
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,899
or Howard marks I remember reading his

178
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,418
autobiography and he said one of the

179
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,399
worst things he ever did was set up like

180
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,258
a switchboard in Amsterdam that he

181
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,560
thought was going to be smooth to like

182
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,180
clear all his calls through like that

183
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,740
just allowed the American government to

184
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,840
listen to everything I was I was saying

185
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,639
yeah it was like the worst decision I

186
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,399
ever made but I was trying to

187
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,340
consolidate things and so I had no idea

188
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,799
about ipns or vpns or any of that stuff

189
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,739
that Raha was mentioning back then I was

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,319
not computer savvy in that sense so I

191
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,259
had no idea if like a interested party

192
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,000
could just pop up and see my address

193
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,400
yeah but

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,439
um overgrow and and cannabis world were

195
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,959
kind of different in the sense that I

196
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,360
would say that like overgrow uh had like

197
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,239
a wider range of participants so it had

198
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,939
like way more like [ __ ] posting

199
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,459
teenagers yelling at you but then it

200
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,379
also had like Sam Skunk Man and Camara

201
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,259
and like different really Heavy Hitters

202
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:40,019
at the time posting on the Breeders you

203
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,240
know the Breeders lab and and that kind

204
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,918
of thing and you know

205
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,500
um Mad Jack you were you know you were

206
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,480
showing off some of the the art that uh

207
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,458
you know existed back then that like

208
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,159
Growers would put on their their

209
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:56,039
products and you know Sam was showing

210
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,559
off his collection you know one time of

211
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,719
all the different art that he had

212
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,039
collected of the you know the localized

213
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,019
and stuff and so that I found

214
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,458
fascinating

215
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,980
um cannabis world had a little bit more

216
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,599
like adult discourse it was smaller and

217
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,639
it was policed a little bit better as

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,339
far as not police like by cops but

219
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,199
police by like members yeah where they

220
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,420
didn't allow quite as much rudeness and

221
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,040
quite as much like you know throwing poo

222
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,319
at one another

223
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,059
um and all that and you know it was

224
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,760
interesting then too because it really

225
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:29,278
documented well like the switch from

226
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,740
Amsterdam to Switzerland

227
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,360
um when breeder Steve and Shanti and a

228
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,539
bunch of those guys transferred from

229
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,159
Holland over to uh the big Swiss and

230
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,838
that was in a lot of people's cases that

231
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,759
was the first time they ever saw large

232
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,220
grows yeah

233
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,139
um you know like greenhouses full Acres

234
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,360
of that type of thing I mean there was

235
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,939
obviously some select people that had

236
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,519
done that themselves uh but for the most

237
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,320
part people first saw that on cannabis

238
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,480
world and

239
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,519
um you know and we learned a lot I mean

240
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,220
and that was also to what rajo was

241
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,860
saying Sam Skunk Man had about four or

242
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,200
five different handles uh he was know it

243
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,480
all for sure he was Jingles he was Sam

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,278
Skunk Man and you started getting people

245
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,980
that got started getting very vocal

246
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,860
about their version of their narrative

247
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,539
yeah and pushing that narrative very

248
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,459
hard and what we've learned over time

249
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,939
with the forums is that the people that

250
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:25,139
are often and early they you know

251
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,060
typically

252
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,699
um that becomes sort of like you know

253
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,500
cannabis lore yeah right and there's a

254
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,120
lot of people that might add more Nuance

255
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,980
to it but the people that were willing

256
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,839
to get out there and type it up and put

257
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,240
their story out first

258
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,000
it carried a lot of weight that people

259
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
were willing to do that we um we had an

260
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
example earlier before you popped on

261
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,599
where um we were talking about the chem

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,560
dog story and we popped up an old uh a

263
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,899
graph of like you know chem 91 chemd and

264
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,819
then the maybe chem four I think and it

265
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,559
was like the tree of lineage of things

266
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,720
that had been crossed to it and what was

267
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,000
related to it and stuff and that lore

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,620
has been there for ages and even you

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,720
know the other day we brought it up that

270
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,240
things are always fluid and changing as

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,060
we learn new things so yeah so it was a

272
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,579
good example of it

273
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:15,719
foreign

274
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:18,479
you know one thing that I I think we

275
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,278
should mention too is that so I live I

276
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,100
live in Mendocino County which is like

277
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,259
tons of people grow weeds so yeah I was

278
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,959
able to hang out with folks

279
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,179
um and talk weed a lot all day long is

280
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,159
just part of my daily life but the

281
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,319
forums what was so attractive about the

282
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,120
forums in my opinion was it was the

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,459
first time that like nationally and

284
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,078
internationally people could talk and

285
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,078
there was a lot of people that started

286
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,078
talking from you know places that were

287
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,699
much more sketchy back then uh police

288
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,139
States if you will states that didn't

289
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,660
have any medical didn't have any

290
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,939
recreate didn't have any of that yeah um

291
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,919
and so for a lot of those people the

292
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,100
only place they felt safe to talk about

293
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,659
it was online

294
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,980
they didn't talk about it with their

295
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,600
friends they didn't talk about it with

296
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,278
their neighbors there might be a tiny

297
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,620
percentage of people that even knew what

298
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,899
they were up to but if they were weed

299
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,519
nerds they had this burning desire to

300
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,578
chat about it

301
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,339
and online provided a semi-anonymous way

302
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:19,319
to shoot the [ __ ] about cannabis

303
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,420
and it was really interesting for a lot

304
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,879
of people because before then it was

305
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:26,458
just small circles and groups and you

306
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,019
know and friendships and you know you

307
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,919
really didn't see how the other half was

308
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,000
living

309
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,620
and pay phones and pay phones

310
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,659
so mad Jack what was your what was your

311
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,360
first form experience what what brought

312
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:42,419
an old vet like you onto the scene to to

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,959
mess with the the newer generation

314
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:49,379
well when Arizona went medical I got my

315
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,239
green card in 2012. and because I was

316
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,360
more than 25 miles from the nearest

317
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,600
dispensary I was able to it said license

318
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,879
to cultivate so I could grow my six

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,700
plants in my backyard or 12 whatever it

320
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,338
was and

321
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,200
I felt relieved because I was doing it

322
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:10,079
semi-legal I mean you always supposed to

323
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,920
have an enclosure with eight foot walls

324
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:18,419
and one inch thick metal door some crazy

325
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:21,479
yeah regulations but I decided mine was

326
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,099
safe enough close enough and I started

327
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,399
searching online

328
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,639
I had done quite a bit of research

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,980
already on weed just to see what was on

330
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,919
the internet probably starting back

331
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,639
I don't know I would go to a store in

332
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:41,278
Sedona they had a T1 line and a T1 was

333
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,680
like Fast yeah it was the best

334
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,838
this is during dialogue days and the

335
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,179
dial up at home if you were trying to

336
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,760
even look at one photo you would wait a

337
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,559
minute so a single naked lady took

338
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,559
forever

339
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,078
so going going to the this video store

340
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,638
that also had T1 lines they had little

341
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,799
booths where you could get on the

342
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,720
internet and it was fast I could do in

343
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,819
one hour what would take me five at home

344
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,579
yeah and it cost I think it was nine

345
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,579
dollars an hour

346
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:14,699
14 is their T1 and somehow

347
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:16,739
I've then I started

348
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,620
well that was the early stuff but later

349
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,000
once I got my license in medical I

350
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,039
thought

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,720
I wonder what the seed world's like and

352
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,740
I started looking around and I found Mr

353
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,040
Nice Forum of Mr Nice seeds

354
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,159
and some of the original people on there

355
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,159
like sensimilla

356
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:40,439
um and a few others became sort of

357
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,259
friends you know I talked to them on

358
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,480
on the uh Forum there

359
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:48,360
and that's where I met rahu he had a

360
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,459
different handle at that time and one

361
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,940
thing led to another then I went and I

362
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:57,059
discovered icy mag and I joined in 2012.

363
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,720
and the same year

364
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,719
and

365
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,740
a little time went by and then I think

366
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,839
it was Elmer Bud it was either Rahul

367
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,240
rahu you remember it was either you or

368
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,180
Elmer that invited me to this other

369
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,459
Forum called for myself I can say that

370
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,078
the the thing that was so crazy for me

371
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,198
about

372
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,179
um Mr Nice specifically was I I think it

373
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:25,620
was I can't remember if it was 09 or

374
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:27,179
2010 but all of a sudden Neville popped

375
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,659
up on there and started answering

376
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:33,419
questions yeah and I was like oh my God

377
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,159
you can just talk to him and you can ask

378
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,620
him all these burning things that I

379
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,319
wanted to know about and then there was

380
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,659
people like um he went by dog list but

381
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,699
there was you know Ortega there was some

382
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,500
other various like Heavy Hitters from

383
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:50,419
that zone that like once they realized

384
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:53,458
Neville was on there they joined too

385
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:55,919
yeah and then and Yosemite Sam from

386
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:58,619
Amsterdam and then so as as some of

387
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,360
those real people started joining there

388
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,500
was an ERA there from probably I don't

389
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,959
know 2009 to maybe 2011 or something

390
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,578
where all of a sudden for me being a

391
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,979
younger guy compared to those guys you

392
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,859
could listen to some of the Giants talk

393
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,839
about Maple Leaf or talk about this or

394
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,879
you could ask Neville questions directly

395
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,459
about some of his lines and he'd give

396
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,439
you answers and where he got the and you

397
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,778
know Seattle Greg was posting on there

398
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,600
about the NL and all of a sudden you had

399
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,399
this collection of you know of sort of

400
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,040
like what I call like first generation

401
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,078
you know Growers and breeders and

402
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,698
Hustlers and movers and shakers all

403
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,019
communicating and you could read what

404
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:39,599
they were talking about to each other

405
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:43,139
yeah it's it's still there that's that's

406
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,940
such an awesome well and uh so you know

407
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,399
and and then so I kind of felt like I

408
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,139
was a fly on the wall and I started

409
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,600
screaming you know I started saving

410
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,039
basically every novel post and every you

411
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,778
know of course it starts all the

412
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,639
arguments and the back and forths and

413
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:58,259
like the are you telling the truths and

414
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,720
like the do you remember this the right

415
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,940
way type of deal

416
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,578
um and but yeah that that was what was

417
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,100
so fascinating to me about Mr nice was

418
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:09,599
that all of a sudden all these cannabis

419
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,578
like Legends

420
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,500
uh pretty much everyone with the

421
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,959
exception of Sam

422
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,058
yeah no Sam would have we would have

423
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,519
they were talking about the wars earlier

424
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:23,279
like me and a few others would go invade

425
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,099
icmag and and do the JibJab memes like

426
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,660
the fake Kung Fu ones uh representing

427
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,039
Neville and it would be like arguments

428
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,840
between Neville and Sam and we would

429
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,000
post those on icmag and they'd come back

430
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,519
on Mr Nice and post theirs over on ours

431
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,679
it was like uh yeah it was a full-on war

432
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,720
that was the first that was the first

433
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,720
time I saw you Matt you know met where

434
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,000
it met you online anyway and yeah you

435
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,298
know I but you know not so you're right

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,880
that was a magic moment at Mr Nice when

437
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,279
Neville came back there and you know the

438
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,559
ability of any member to just pop in and

439
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,379
asking questions and you know what just

440
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:01,259
and the attraction how how people could

441
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,760
not stay away like you mentioned Chimera

442
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,400
and

443
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,119
um you know Matt was there of course

444
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,100
um

445
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:13,558
who wants a dogless Tempe

446
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:14,879
heavy and big and big herb and there was

447
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,740
yeah big herb was definitely there there

448
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,620
was a lot of people that were that were

449
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,538
involved and like Kanga kangavida and

450
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,918
when I when I first got when I first

451
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:26,279
started really meeting people in

452
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,320
Amsterdam I realized that like there was

453
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,700
a bunch of older guys that had beefs

454
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,980
with each other that didn't get along

455
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,660
exactly and they had their versions of

456
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,279
events and then they would just continue

457
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,720
said war on whatever Forum got created

458
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,819
this is my story and then they'd be like

459
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,980
no no no that's ridiculous this is what

460
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,139
happened you're so full of it and there

461
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,298
was these camps that would form on like

462
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,880
Matt and I joke about it of like which

463
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:53,519
Shady character do you believe more yeah

464
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,220
because you could poke holes in any of

465
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,700
us really to somebody yeah you know

466
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,160
and uh but yeah that was dogless dogless

467
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,319
was Ortega you know

468
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,779
um and you know he gave Neville four or

469
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,339
five super important lines

470
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,839
um that still remain there's a lot of

471
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:11,699
mystery to them

472
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,918
um but just watching those older guys

473
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,900
communicate with each other and dropping

474
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,080
things that that were maybe normal to

475
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,298
them but were gems to us was a was a

476
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,599
pretty magical time that era of Mr Nice

477
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:26,400
forums was pretty cool yeah yeah and and

478
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,798
of course like like you mentioned there

479
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,019
were other other people that weren't big

480
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,058
shots at the time but turned into big

481
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,679
you know people that that we've all

482
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,960
heard of today

483
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,720
um and had valuable things and valuable

484
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Insight you know to add to like you know

485
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,179
what what what was Santa Cruz like in

486
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,339
that early late 60s early 70s era what

487
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,440
was this going on in some different

488
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,379
depth to things and so there was some

489
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,259
really intelligent cannabis conversation

490
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,580
going on uh in those years right there

491
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:00,058
that was pretty cool

492
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:01,939
yeah a lot of it sadly some of those old

493
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:05,160
Neville posts have been

494
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,019
disappeared manicured yeah they're

495
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,140
getting they're getting cleaned up to to

496
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:12,779
help with the Clutter yes on it I think

497
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,179
yeah anything anything contrary you know

498
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,619
um last night did you see that when I I

499
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,380
think I texted it to you last night not

500
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,519
so it was a screenshot of a post from

501
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,120
Shanti

502
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,160
saying that uh nordl is super skunk oh

503
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,319
yeah he did that on IG two days ago or

504
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,840
something like that is that confusing to

505
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,960
you at all uh it wasn't so much

506
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:36,480
confusing I mean the the problem that

507
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,700
you have with anyone not just Shanti but

508
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,798
with anyone is that you get their

509
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,259
version of what's going on and do you

510
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,240
have others that will can corroborate

511
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,339
like what they're talking about you know

512
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,798
and it's like you know I know for a fact

513
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,839
we know for a fact that Sean that

514
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,759
Neville sold a huge amount of seeds to

515
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,740
to Shanti and that they worked together

516
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,058
and did various things together for a

517
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,058
period of time

518
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,678
and so there's this no seed company that

519
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,558
I'm aware of has ever admitted that

520
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
they've ever lost anything ever uh and

521
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,660
Simon Simon has admitted he's lost the

522
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,380
parents to Kelly Mist I believe but it

523
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,019
just in general in general you know like

524
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,419
I think this is what's crazy is you guys

525
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,759
is that like if you go on Scentsy seeds

526
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:23,940
website right now they still have

527
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,558
Neville photos from the 80s yeah as

528
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,298
their description you know for their

529
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:28,918
depicts for their descriptions of their

530
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:33,058
lines and those and those photos were

531
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,220
taken in 1988 1989 and 1990. yeah and

532
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,079
they're still the same ones that's not

533
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,179
even the worst part though I mean then

534
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,220
you read the stories and it makes it

535
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,038
sound like the dronkers climbed their

536
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,558
way through the Himalayas to get meet

537
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:49,700
the farmers you know and they personally

538
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,139
brought it back you know they in a CIA

539
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,440
helicopter you know I mean it's just

540
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:58,140
it's Neville was insane Neville was the

541
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,380
only one to admit yeah we lost that yeah

542
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,200
this died yeah this changed that was my

543
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,179
fault and the rest of them almost

544
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,538
universally are like that makes

545
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:11,640
identifying things difficult because

546
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,740
um you know they people obviously don't

547
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,419
want to admit that they lose certain

548
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,319
things because they want those modern

549
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:21,538
sales right you know it goes beyond that

550
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,759
though I mean let's assume that the cuts

551
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,919
got lost but so what did they have to

552
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,980
dig through to replace it you know or

553
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,840
that you know of course they never admit

554
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,700
that they lost anything okay so we'll

555
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,558
take that for granted and then then we

556
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,840
assume okay they they won't admit it but

557
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,720
we know they've lost something so what

558
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:42,058
did they have to work with to to to pick

559
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,880
The Replacements themselves you know in

560
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:47,038
the case of Neville he did you know he a

561
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,620
lot of the posts that were deleted were

562
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,500
talking about indicas and his breeding

563
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,759
work with indicas yeah and uh which is

564
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,140
is interesting because I haven't seen

565
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,700
that instant post that you're talking

566
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,659
about where they're they're claiming

567
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,880
that that nordl is uh Super Skunk yeah

568
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,559
but you know you can see that this is

569
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,200
one of those things where it's partially

570
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:11,158
true you know so the parents of Super

571
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,038
Skunk Afghan T and and skunk one are

572
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,980
contained in normal yep sure no doubt

573
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:20,400
but do we think it's pure Afghan t plus

574
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,159
plus skunk uh one probably not no right

575
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,860
no I mean oh how we wish it was right

576
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,720
but it's not and Neville in those old

577
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:31,319
posts that are now missing you know

578
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,960
talked about how he mixed he crossed all

579
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,658
of those Maple Leaf

580
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,679
um cuttings together yeah you know he

581
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:44,520
had the ort 15 the Afghan s Afghan T and

582
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:47,220
big bud Kush 4 and one that was a big

583
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,139
bud like yeah he called it big bud but

584
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,960
it was not the big bud strain right

585
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,538
correct so it's like go ahead go ahead

586
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,538
and answer I always view Shanti as a bit

587
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:59,038
like the the The Bridge Troll or the

588
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:01,500
Sphinx that wants you to answer the

589
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,779
three riddles and so you know you're

590
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,339
like just give it to me clear and he'll

591
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,099
just like you know he'll dance around

592
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:10,500
the topic

593
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:12,178
you know and so you know we know

594
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,220
um one of the interesting things that we

595
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,500
found out is that we weren't exactly

596
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,240
sure how large The Collection that he

597
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,460
bought off Neville was and apparently

598
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,960
it's so large that people involved think

599
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,538
that he couldn't even get through it in

600
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,038
a lifetime if he wanted to wow yeah so

601
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:27,720
then it really just becomes about like

602
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:29,460
does he have the eye and does he have

603
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,460
the selections because he has the

604
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,259
genetics it's just he you know how many

605
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,819
mothers does he have how many fathers

606
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:39,000
does he have is he pulling them out of

607
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:40,918
f2s you know I agree completely but

608
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,200
there's actually something even more and

609
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,620
does is he even doing the selecting

610
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,960
himself anymore yeah sure yeah exactly I

611
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,058
mean uh because

612
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,819
I don't know I've seen some I've seen

613
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:56,460
some people working

614
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:59,158
Ortega and and some other some other

615
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,400
fresh seeds from them that don't look

616
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,880
the the phenos that I saw you know 15

617
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,759
well 10 10 years ago are not in there

618
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,039
anymore yeah right and I was like dude I

619
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,440
don't know I need to tell you if if we

620
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,058
would have known if I would have known

621
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,640
that basically every five or ten years

622
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:19,259
the seed game completely changes and

623
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,679
what you thought would be available for

624
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:25,079
a long time has now disappeared forever

625
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,000
um you know Matt and I were looking at

626
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,699
uh we I have a friend with a freezer

627
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,440
that got out of the game and gave all of

628
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,419
his seeds to a good friend of ours and

629
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
most of most of those seeds are from

630
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,340
2009 to 2012.

631
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,500
and Matt and I were just shocked that

632
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,178
like maybe one percent of those seeds

633
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,119
are still available today if you wanted

634
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,640
to buy them yeah yeah so you know the

635
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,379
the Neville era the Scentsy ERA this the

636
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,419
serious era like all these different

637
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,120
seed companies maybe they have the same

638
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,038
stock for four or five years right and

639
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,979
then something happens like we know that

640
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,298
Shanti got raided in in Switzerland what

641
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,038
did he lose then

642
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,619
what did he have before what did he have

643
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,839
after in a lot of those cases

644
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:08,759
um they don't it doesn't benefit them in

645
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,158
any way to like be completely up front

646
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,200
so then they're not

647
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,820
you know yeah

648
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,400
um yeah and and I've been we've been

649
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:21,538
trying to get Shanti to admit for years

650
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,980
if nordal was his version of super skunk

651
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,339
and he never would

652
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,440
up until do you remember do you remember

653
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:30,298
um raho when this strain came out

654
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,919
because it was originally another strain

655
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,500
that he had listed and I think it was

656
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,538
just called Afghan skunk at the time and

657
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,038
he said I'm changing this to nordl in

658
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:39,538
honor of

659
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:41,099
I can't remember what it was [ __ ] in

660
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:43,740
honor of maybe the Mr Nice movie coming

661
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:46,500
out yeah it was the code name that um

662
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,359
Howard marks used to describe a load of

663
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,460
hash but I think it was because the

664
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,319
movie was coming out in UK and he

665
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,880
renamed it in honor of the movie because

666
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,119
in the movie they make that a big deal

667
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,539
okay I remember correctly the context of

668
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,979
that too because I met uh Neville uh

669
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,220
briefly a few times and one of his

670
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,640
Partners in the 90s in Amsterdam and

671
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,819
after he left Scentsy he had to call

672
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,220
Super Skunk Ultra skunk

673
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:17,579
because Sensei had trademarked the names

674
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,740
to most of his genetics yeah and so

675
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:23,038
therefore since he owned the name super

676
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,538
skunk and so from the time he I mean I

677
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,259
remember because I bought some Ultra

678
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:30,599
skunk he had to call it Ultra skunk

679
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:32,220
um and so in in that case if Shanti was

680
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,139
going to sell his version he literally

681
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,940
couldn't sell Super Skunk the only

682
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,640
people that can sell Super Skunk in

683
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,220
Holland are Scentsy seeds

684
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,259
because they bought they owned the um

685
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,179
they they trademarked almost all the

686
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,798
names yeah to be honest I'm kind of

687
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,360
shocked he didn't like throw devil in

688
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,460
there and [ __ ] and like all the other

689
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,240
stuff that are like Afghan skunks you

690
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,519
know

691
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,200
so there's so I do give shauncey a

692
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,798
little bit of slack in the sense that he

693
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,179
has to be it's hard to it's hard to say

694
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,679
some of these things because there are

695
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,659
there is some legality and that's what's

696
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,400
kind of going on now too is people are

697
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,740
starting to try to patent names in

698
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,600
America in different areas and different

699
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,819
regions and being like oh well we have

700
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,278
this name

701
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:16,980
um and you know uh but it's interesting

702
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,599
too like um you know like the one name

703
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,538
that they didn't for some reason they

704
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,899
don't have a patent on an L5 Haze

705
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:27,179
but they do on super skunk

706
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,919
yeah that's probably the Illuminati has

707
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,559
something to do with that yeah yeah the

708
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,059
can Illuminati

709
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,700
yeah and then and then and then they

710
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:37,500
patented all the NL names

711
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,120
you know so they had to call the NL

712
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,519
stuff different work

713
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,798
yeah that's why that's why I believe was

714
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,440
it Dutch Passion Matt they had to call

715
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:48,480
their nl2 version Oasis yeah I believe

716
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,000
so we'll find out we'll find out they

717
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,819
they seem to be open to talking and yeah

718
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,500
I will say Dutch Passion um out of all

719
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,139
the Dutch companies I've ever reached

720
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,000
out to Dutch passions like been open to

721
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,400
sending me their old catalogs scanning

722
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,380
them in like helping with the archive so

723
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,600
I'm stoked to interview them because

724
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,580
they have an actual genuine interest in

725
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:10,139
the culture and I remember like they

726
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,538
they were actually have been at the

727
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,640
Forefront of some cannabis technology

728
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:16,319
um I want to ask them about their

729
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,360
artificial seeds they were the first to

730
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,538
push artificial seeds and and sell those

731
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:24,959
and some of their clone clonal strains

732
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:26,158
as artificial seeds and uh it

733
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,140
disappeared I don't know if they only

734
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,059
tried it in Europe for a while but it

735
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,799
was it was so far ahead of its time this

736
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:33,839
is like 2012 when they were doing

737
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,940
artificial seeds so I even think they

738
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,099
were the first person I ever saw talk

739
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,000
about feminized work I think there are

740
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,759
some of the first that we're selling

741
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,278
feminized before Americans you know

742
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,278
people like you Matt or CSI I think they

743
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,298
coined the terms

744
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,038
some of the first people that were

745
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:51,720
involved on the American side of things

746
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,460
I think I first saw it from Dutch

747
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,640
Passion offering up

748
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,200
you know feminized

749
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,720
Bitcoin the term I didn't know anybody

750
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,298
ever made some of the sold some of those

751
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,940
artificial seeds which is basically uh

752
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:08,759
tissue culture right and a tiny little

753
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:12,000
capsule is that basically the idea yeah

754
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:14,278
some sort of Mary stem or whatever some

755
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,079
kind of colonial tissue yeah some kind

756
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,119
of tissue I remember Camaro was talking

757
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,099
about that and I was like yeah this is

758
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,439
another thing I'm never gonna see yeah

759
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,759
yeah yeah I was super stoked when they

760
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,620
started doing it but the problem is

761
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,720
because it's a

762
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,339
um it's it is tissue culture not

763
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,380
everyone can get these things to quote

764
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:34,918
unquote germinate you know I mean it

765
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,480
takes real genuine care and yeah you

766
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,520
don't just throw it out in the yard and

767
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,740
set up the sprinkler you know I mean the

768
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,119
idea was that you like yeah the idea was

769
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,099
that you could hopefully like plant it

770
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,778
under dirt and it'll just grow but I

771
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:47,879
mean people have enough time hard time

772
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:50,579
popping normal seeds let alone

773
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,200
artificial seeds you know well he was

774
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:55,019
talking about that stuff about the same

775
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,480
time that he was doing his massive clone

776
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,700
collecting

777
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,159
all over North America who's that

778
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,778
Chimera yeah yeah he was talking about

779
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,760
oh we're going to make these artificial

780
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,220
seeds it's going to be tissue culture

781
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,919
and we'll preserve them forever you know

782
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,298
it gave everybody the idea idea that he

783
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,419
was going to be

784
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:17,700
the dude repository of all this precious

785
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:18,659
germplasm for the rest of the world you

786
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,298
know and he's going to out of the

787
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:23,520
goodness of his heart I will say that

788
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:25,379
when I was reading on the Breeders lab

789
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,658
on overgrow

790
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,640
that Camara was one of the most

791
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:33,360
intimidating people on there at the time

792
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,820
I was probably in my early 20s then and

793
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,798
uh the depth of like breeding knowledge

794
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:39,720
that he had like in the education that

795
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,359
he had and sort of like the

796
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,240
ego and dismissiveness that he had like

797
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:48,000
it uh it really made me

798
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,919
um but it also made me it intimidated me

799
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,599
for for lack of a better term I was like

800
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,059
am I how am I but then there's this

801
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,439
weird part where the older I've gotten I

802
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:57,658
definitely think we need you need to

803
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
know some of that but breeding is as

804
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,820
much art as it is science to me and you

805
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,880
really have to have the eye and some

806
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:08,038
luck maybe and really and really test it

807
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:12,059
smoking wise and see what's going on

808
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:14,339
because it's not just strict science

809
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:15,778
um what you're after is invisible well

810
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,819
we were talking about we were talking

811
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:20,278
about this the other day it's so it's

812
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:24,778
it's a great point you know of all these

813
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:26,880
all these multi-million dollar bankroll

814
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:28,919
um genetics operations that are trying

815
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,919
to come up with the next big thing in

816
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,500
cannabis you know what have they

817
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,659
produced every year a new batch of

818
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,419
winners comes from the from you know

819
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:42,059
from banjo Point Moonshiners in the

820
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,820
Hills yeah blow away everything that was

821
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:47,220
done the year before and yet you got

822
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,038
these boys in their white lab coats and

823
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,720
you know with the with the gas

824
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:55,278
chromatographs you know looking at the

825
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,278
DNA and what are they coming up with

826
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,960
did his when Matt did his uh actually

827
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:06,240
talking about that I will say that I saw

828
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,980
an interview with Shanti that made that

829
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,159
I kind of totally agreed with him where

830
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,860
he said that his CBD work is very

831
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,080
scientific and it's very documented and

832
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,918
it's very by the book and it's very that

833
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,199
way

834
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,919
but he said the Cannabis side is almost

835
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,840
all judgment and art yeah and I found

836
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,640
that very interesting observation that

837
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,418
he felt like the science of getting

838
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,460
these CBD CBG CBN type things it was

839
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:35,220
very very documented based and it was

840
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,140
very very testing based and he said the

841
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,778
Cannabis side is still the eye

842
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,179
it's still looking and hunting you know

843
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:44,940
part some of the goals of that of that

844
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:48,179
um CBD or the hemp Market is to come up

845
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,840
with strains that will will produce from

846
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:54,000
seed consistently low levels of of THC

847
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,759
with you know those those threshold

848
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,880
levels of cannabinoids that allow them

849
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,099
to legally grow it and it's and it's

850
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,440
really it's It's tricky to do that and

851
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,839
then once they once they figure out how

852
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,940
to isolate you know certain ratios then

853
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,878
they're they're trying to explore that

854
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,159
and create you know in strains in seed

855
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:16,858
that can produce other cannabinoids you

856
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
know to the exclusions of others

857
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:21,598
um all of this made necessary by

858
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,418
regulation of course you know if you

859
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,159
could just grow you could separate the

860
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,898
different cannabinoids and have one

861
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,260
plant that grew them all but you know

862
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,878
because the laws

863
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:36,060
differentiates between hemp and

864
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,199
and uh regular drug cannabis and you

865
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:39,599
know they have to treat these things

866
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,219
differently but yeah I mean one thing

867
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,019
that's interesting about that too and it

868
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,719
was like my second favorite part of that

869
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,338
Shanti interview was that he said that

870
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,500
one of the differences between what he

871
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:51,599
was doing with his crew and others is

872
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,719
that a lot of others were working with

873
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,720
hemp to breed CBD and CBN and CBG stuff

874
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,079
and he was trying to breed that stuff

875
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,000
from drug cultivars and bring it out in

876
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,119
the regular lines that had already been

877
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,400
bred for consumption and I thought that

878
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,019
was an interesting approach you know he

879
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,780
wasn't necessarily trying to breed it

880
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:15,780
from hemp he was trying to bring it out

881
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:19,280
in the lines that already existed

882
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,280
from the Cannabis side of things

883
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,699
I've grown some of his lines that look

884
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:27,079
like they might have had some hemp in

885
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:29,699
them I would concur yeah

886
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,740
this is completely off topic and I'm not

887
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,078
trying to derail it but uh raho your new

888
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:36,479
Avatar is the stuff of nightmares but to

889
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,280
get back on to get back on target for a

890
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,460
second one of the things that I do think

891
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,400
was revolutionary about the forums

892
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,380
opening up was it really was the first

893
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,119
time that people outside their own

894
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,800
friend groups in the Cannabis space

895
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,320
could start communicating with each

896
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,200
other and people from different parts of

897
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,480
America or Europe or Australia or

898
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,578
wherever could start talking about

899
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,219
something in ways that had never

900
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:04,920
happened before and so despite all the

901
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,899
the the the attacks and poop throwing

902
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,519
and wars that got started over things

903
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,400
and people being mean behind their

904
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:14,280
keyboard it really did Advance a lot of

905
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,139
things and it really did give a base

906
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,619
um for people to start discussing things

907
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:21,239
in public because at the time that all

908
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,858
those at the time that all those things

909
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,899
first came out I think overgrowth

910
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:27,739
started in the very late 90s

911
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,320
if I recall correctly only California

912
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:34,500
had medical at that time yes um so it

913
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,099
was just in the infancy of you know not

914
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,320
being totally illegal everywhere yeah

915
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:43,619
um and you know and it started to slowly

916
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,000
spread but I do think that

917
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,680
um you know and there's a lot of people

918
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,239
we could probably talk about like like

919
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,098
you know we everyone laughed when I said

920
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,219
hempy the reason why everybody laughed

921
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,380
was because he was a you know he was

922
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:57,358
argumentative you know and people had

923
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,300
personalities and people like Vic high

924
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,338
or you know people were famously like my

925
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,280
God you say the wrong thing to Tom Hill

926
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:08,820
20 years ago uh and he would just tear

927
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,800
your head off 20 years ago daily back

928
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,320
then you know like yeah in that in that

929
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,660
era and so there started being the first

930
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,059
like weed internet personalities and

931
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:20,219
then when people like Sam skunk man got

932
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,799
online or people like Khmer like there

933
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:25,679
was like Heroes that started yeah

934
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,859
um and it was also the first era to me

935
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,319
where visual aspects of cannabis became

936
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:33,900
very important like when people started

937
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,000
posting their stories around

938
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,740
um you know blueberry yeah and people

939
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,420
started posting these crazy I mean

940
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:41,159
that's where your passion for it started

941
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,420
right Matt you start going online and

942
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,879
looking at these posts and you're like

943
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,858
what is that thing yeah what is this

944
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,740

946
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,659
why does it have all these purple leaves

947
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,059
and especially like pre-cookie it was

948
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:57,960
wild looking cannabis oh yeah I was you

949

giving people a view into other people's

962
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,740
Gardens almost for the first time yeah

963

looks like Urkel I bet that's a Packy on

974
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,578

975

other day and ran it by Neville's old

986
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,480
partner and he's like yup that is G13

987
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,220
that's exactly how I remember her and it

988
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,019
was from an old cat and it wasn't even a

989
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,299
catalog it was an old magazine clipping

990
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:41,219
uh I think from High Times or head

991
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,560
magazine one of the two and it was of

992
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:47,039
Neville's grow room and I had G13 it had

993
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:49,320
a few shots of nl5 but that also got

994
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,380
Neville's old partner to tell us

995
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,780
that G13 was Apple smelling green apple

996
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,180
smelling which I never knew and I've

997
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,400
always heard rubber all this other stuff

998
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:01,679
but I've never heard it directly from

999
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,660
any source that had it you know like

1000
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,338
what the the scent profile was and he

1001
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:08,039
says green apple

1002
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:09,900
that's what yeah that's a good I can

1003
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,179
hear that as you know I can interpret

1004
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,039
that as being kind of salary citrusy

1005
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,919
maybe you know with a little bit of that

1006
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,838
that acidic bite not necessarily Citrus

1007
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,240
but

1008
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:22,980
um I don't know the other thing 18 has

1009
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,319
some too the other thing I found crazy

1010
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,119
about the forums is like you jump on and

1011
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,320
you see some threads that would get

1012
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,000
locked

1013
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,380
and then you'd be like oh why did that

1014
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,820
get locked and you jump on there and

1015
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,260
then there's like all these spicy

1016
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,059
arguments that go you see my name

1017
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,680
about what's true and what's not and

1018
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:42,000
there's people that you know that was

1019
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,179
kind of the first time where your

1020
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,679
popularity in some instances like LED

1021
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,078
people to whether they were going to

1022
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,940
believe you or not and people would

1023
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,880
start poking holes in stories and it's

1024
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,220
also the same era where a lot of people

1025
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,920
have told a bunch of Stories on various

1026
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:01,500
forums at various times and some of

1027
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,500
those Legends don't line up and it's

1028
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,019
like all their own words and so in 2004

1029
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,699
this is what I wrote and then in 2010 I

1030
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,159
kind of changed it and I wrote this and

1031
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:14,399
now in 2018 I'm talking about this and

1032
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,319
now today I'm talking this yeah and it's

1033
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,440
interesting because it puts down on not

1034
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,260
on paper necessarily but it puts down to

1035
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,280
some degree a record

1036
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,140
um you know there's some things like

1037
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,660
icmag like you guys were mentioning even

1038
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:30,719
on Mr Nice it puts it down on a record

1039
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:33,358
until someone in the managerial capacity

1040
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,098
on the Forum decides to either lock or

1041
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,440
eliminate certain posts because it

1042
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,019
doesn't fit a narrative yep so it's not

1043
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,460
perfect because definitely on icmag

1044
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,960
there's been there's been things that

1045
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,199
have gone off the reservation if you

1046
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,019
will and uh the thread or certain

1047
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,419
comments disappears

1048
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:54,179
yeah and I try to remind that to to

1049
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,920
people who are researching nowadays that

1050
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,019
it's it's hard to remember a few things

1051
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,440
if you're like let's say you you showed

1052
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:04,559
up uh 2016 past you know 10 15 after

1053
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,320
that what you're looking at is a very

1054
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,838
um it's a just a small sample of the

1055
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,019
forums that were available like icmag

1056
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,940
THC farmer roll it up

1057
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,320
um but there were a lot more reforms

1058
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,119
than that a lot of private forums like

1059
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,039
we talked about there were there were

1060
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,440
other just smaller forms couch lock Cafe

1061
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,539
you know uh pot pimp there were there

1062
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,260
were a bunch of them out there and those

1063
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:31,739
are long gone seed Depot gone and you're

1064
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,200
seeing a small section and most of these

1065
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:37,199
forums were run by people

1066
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:39,179
selling either a seed bank or had a seed

1067
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,779
bank carrying many breeders or were run

1068
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:46,259
by a breeder themselves and 99 of the

1069
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:48,839
time you were it was very clicky so

1070
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,060
you'd have people who were asked kissy

1071
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,039
to the owner of the Forum they would

1072
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:55,259
become the moderators and it would

1073
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,539
become a lot of cheerleader rah-rah

1074
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,640
stuff I felt like

1075
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,858
um and it happened everywhere even on my

1076
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,139
Forum you know like that I ran it was it

1077
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:06,838
was very riot-centric because that's

1078
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:08,039
just the way it worked out you know but

1079
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,599
people are seeing a very small

1080
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,759
screenshot so if you're coming into the

1081
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,338
forum era now trying to go back research

1082
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,619
you're missing a lot of context and a

1083
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:17,818
lot of data is mainly what I'm trying to

1084
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,000
say

1085
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:24,960
yeah people uh people delete posts they

1086
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,338
threads are locked or or post deleted

1087
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,699
um sometimes

1088
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:31,739
you know entire threads are are removed

1089
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,818
yeah do you guys do you guys remember

1090
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:37,439
the Crusty buckets oh yeah

1091
00:43:34,818 --> 00:43:39,480
I mean there was these Canadians on

1092

there that were growing like in in grow

1093
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,679
rocks and they were growing like very

1094
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,220
few plants but they were growing two to

1095
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:49,440
four pound plants inside on this crazy

1096
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:51,299
hydroponic nft method called crusty

1097
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,740
buckets and there would be some forums

1098
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,280
there would be some threads that would

1099
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,559
just go on for hundreds of pages yeah

1100
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,480
um a combination of people asking tons

1101
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,880
of questions or the original poster

1102

1118
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,140
attention to what he's speaking about

1119
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,480
because you know there's not very many

1120
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:49,440
references to it the either you guys

1121

can't find him and I've been trying to

1123
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,059
find him I know you guys have other old

1124
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,579
friends out there so put the word out

1125
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,920
for him he was such a nice gentleman an

1126
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:01,140
old Smuggler and he's responsible for

1127
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,400
one of my best-selling lines of all time

1128
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:05,239
and I've never been able to thank him

1129
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,639
but he was a wonderful wonderful dude

1130
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:11,399
from Florida see what I can find there

1131
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,500
was a guy on there named Big Sur who

1132
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,200
used to post a lot about apparently he

1133
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,960
was from Central Central California same

1134
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,818
general Santa Cruz type of region and

1135
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,559
you know he offered up a lot of his

1136
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,480
opinions on like what was around and

1137
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,179
what he was seeing and what Hayes was

1138
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,500
like and like different you know just

1139
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:30,480
different stuff like that and whether

1140
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,420
it's true or not it's always valuable to

1141
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,858
get different people's opinions on the

1142
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,920
same era because people have different

1143
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:40,139
memories and different experiences too

1144
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,180
it's a it's a little sad when you see

1145
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:43,980
people like you know I'm not going to

1146
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:46,199
say Big Sur because I'm not sure if this

1147
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,780
applies to him but you know older guys

1148
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:51,000
telling stories from way back

1149
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,579
and and they're active and they're up

1150
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,260
there you know every every week or you

1151
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,579
know every couple of months they'll show

1152
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,040
up and they're talking about what

1153
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,318
they're doing and over time that they

1154
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,239
just start kind of dropping off showing

1155
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:05,639
up less often until finally they just

1156
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,318
don't come back yeah um you know I've

1157
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:10,980
seen enough of those

1158
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:13,800
that just the really old stories kind of

1159
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,599
like what what were you know Jackie and

1160
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,480
I started talking about when we came on

1161
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,480
here are the older ones are are

1162
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,699
disappearing at a at a rapid rate so I'm

1163
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,400
glad you guys got us on here I don't I

1164
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:28,799
don't like to think of myself as being

1165
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,680
in that category of a you know a

1166
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,920
perishable item past the sell-by date on

1167
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,960
the Shelf but yeah I mean dude I used to

1168
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,180
ask this is probably 20 years ago now

1169
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,039
but I used to ask my grandpa like what

1170
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:43,379
it was like getting old

1171
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,119
and he was he shows you know is the

1172
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,358
weirdest thing ever he goes in my mind

1173
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,160
I'm like 28 with a bunch of wisdom yeah

1174
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:51,719
until I drop something on the floor and

1175
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,259
then I bend over to pick it up and I'm

1176
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:57,480
like oh I'm old you know and and it's

1177
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,920
crazy too because it's like that to me

1178
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,780
like you know I grew up in the 80s the

1179
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,599
80s doesn't seem all that long ago but

1180
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,119
boy it's getting farther away all the

1181
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,579
time and you know the like the first and

1182
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,640
second generation even of of cannabis

1183
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:13,980
growers in America that span the 60s and

1184
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,440
70s those you know that's you know

1185
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,480
there's there's less and less you know

1186
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,818
viewpoints and then the 80s even there's

1187
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,500
less and less viewpoints and so that

1188
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:24,059
kind of History like that's why I think

1189
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,679
this is so cool of what we're all doing

1190
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:28,139
is like getting some of that oral

1191
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,000
history down whether it's written down

1192
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:32,338
or whether it's like you know talked

1193
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,940
about on on like this is pretty

1194
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:39,199
important or a strain or a strain index

1195
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,338
online that you know one of those things

1196
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,439
one of the craziest things about out

1197
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:46,019
this was like being able to talk to mad

1198
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,260
Jag about like skunk one from the late

1199
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:52,559
70s or early 80s yeah like that's wild

1200
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,380
to me because having someone that had

1201
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,940
actual experience growing it then like

1202
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,380
and growing a good amount of it and

1203
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,338
being able to see what it was really

1204
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,940
like

1205
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:04,559
incredibly rare not only that to me it's

1206
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,539
it's not just having someone with

1207
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,980
experience that grew up back then but

1208
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,719
someone that had experience growing

1209
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,880
other stuff and had experience with

1210
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,559
cannabis and different the different

1211
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,838
experiences cannabis had to offer

1212
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,519
already before a growing skunk one so

1213
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,980
they they could sense those nuances

1214
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,858
those fine difference and smells that to

1215
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,420
me is what what separates this story

1216
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,039
specifically from a lot of other

1217
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,338
people's old Tales yeah I agree skunk

1218
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:34,400
one and 85 you know it was skunky yeah

1219
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:37,559
exactly yeah this this is having someone

1220
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,500
with with the nose and the eye that was

1221
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,838
there that is is interested in the

1222
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,019
genetic aspect too that's as nerdy as

1223
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:48,059
all of us and and as advanced as an

1224
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:49,980
archivist as he is I think that was that

1225
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,960
was key and that was really important to

1226
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,059
have that

1227
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,699
one of the things that super humbles me

1228
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:59,759
in cannabis is that um

1229
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:01,980
it seems like the early raw work that

1230
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,660
people do ends up being the best

1231
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,099
and then they get older and more

1232
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:07,500
experienced and they try to make it

1233
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,480
better and they make it worse yeah you

1234
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,818
know and you know Neville admitted that

1235
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,740
like he got the haze and you know the

1236
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:15,420
f1s were the coolest thing he ever did

1237
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:17,519
with them and the more work he put into

1238
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,800
it he goes none of the poly hybrids were

1239
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,139
nearly as nice as like the one the first

1240
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,760
crosses I made yeah and he's like I

1241
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,679
tried and I tried and I tried and I

1242
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,960
tried and then I had to agree that like

1243
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,179
the first stuff I did was better than

1244
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,179
anything I did after that

1245
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:36,179
hey can I ask you guys a little NL

1246
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:39,960
question sir have you ever found an

1247
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:45,358
elfino that was high interpineline

1248
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:48,780
yeah uh I want to say yes in nl5x2

1249
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:51,838
I agree and a lot of the nl5x2 Repros

1250
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:54,740
that came out from Old Stock uh have a

1251
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:57,539
lot of mild to moderate terpenly knows

1252
00:49:54,739 --> 00:50:00,000
interesting Danny's have it as well it's

1253
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:03,239
a trolley so it's it's in the Afghan

1254
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,599
Pakistani lines okay so you know that

1255
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:10,019
terpenolene is so so strongly associated

1256
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,818
with Neville's Haze yeah right and I've

1257
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:14,818
heard you guys talk about that once you

1258
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:16,858
get it in in a line it's it's damn near

1259
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:19,800
impossible to breed it out if you decide

1260
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:22,199
you don't want it in there anymore

1261
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,960
um just kind of curious because you know

1262
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:26,578
I think a lot of people associate that

1263
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,920
terpenolene

1264
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:31,619
um with Haze a

1265
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,338
right because yeah yeah you don't really

1266
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:39,240
get those phenos in an SSH or a mango or

1267
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:41,699
any of those other skunk NL Haze combos

1268
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:44,959
that are around you don't get that heavy

1269
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:47,818
you get it from Neville's right

1270
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,838
so people think okay what's the

1271
00:50:47,818 --> 00:50:51,358
difference between Neville's and

1272
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,279
everything else Haze a is the main thing

1273
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,400
and so they immediately attribute that

1274
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,180
turpinawin to the haze but I'm wondering

1275
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:04,019
if it just was the female that he used

1276
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:05,940
to make Neville's Haze that had a

1277
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:09,119
terpenolin Dom

1278
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,579
you know Northern Lights mama so the

1279
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,460
interesting part about that is that if

1280
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:16,800
you believe Neville's tale about nl5

1281
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,699
he grew a bunch of the seeds and they

1282
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,740
were a big mix of Indica sativa hybrid

1283
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:23,699
phenos that were all over the place and

1284
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:25,799
crazy

1285
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:27,838
and there was this one Fino he found

1286
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,280
that almost looked pure Afghan and

1287
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:33,000
that's the one that he picked to breed

1288
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:37,140
with but the seed line itself was

1289
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,139
definitely a Afghan sativa mix

1290
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:43,379
and so it's entirely possible that in

1291
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:45,480
Neville's selection of nl5 there was

1292
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,280
some genes in there that combined with

1293
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,699
other genes could pop out that

1294
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,200
terpenoline in Plants very much so see

1295
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:54,118
Matt's going to get excited about this

1296
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:55,618
because I I remember Neville's

1297
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,920
statements differently than what you're

1298
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:04,920
saying not to so uh oh yeah let's hear

1299
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:07,920
it yeah so I mean you're saying that um

1300
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,780
what do you know what did you say oh he

1301
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,880
went through the the seeds he got right

1302
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,240
so there were two at first he wanted

1303
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,519
cuttings and seeds from the original NL

1304
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,199
crew and then he had a falling out with

1305
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,838
those guys who knows what it was about

1306
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,719
maybe money I don't know

1307
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:28,139
um and and he wound up going to kind of

1308
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:31,858
somebody in the NL crew orbit

1309
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:35,039
not the original guys to get those seeds

1310
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:37,619
was that Seattle Greg was the guy in the

1311
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,880
orbit so I believe Seattle Greg was the

1312
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:42,180
original guy that he was getting him

1313
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,338
from okay and if I remember correctly it

1314
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:46,139
was Don Downs the Indian

1315
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:47,940
that he got it from the second time and

1316
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:50,759
then he was around them that he wasn't

1317
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,980
he wasn't a veteran his son had served

1318
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,380
or something and he you know they they

1319
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,480
kind of anyway it's it's got all the

1320
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:01,140
Hallmarks of of one of those old

1321
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,240
[ __ ] legendary stories but

1322
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:05,818
um you know the the main thing is is

1323
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:08,159
that Neville Neville blew his deal with

1324
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:11,818
the original guys and wound up going to

1325
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,920
kind of a side periphery guy to get the

1326
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:16,858
seeds that he would ultimately work with

1327
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,920
yeah and and those seats you know that

1328
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:22,739
Neville said that he concluded that hit

1329
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:27,079
the the the five The Cutting he kept as

1330
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:27,078
an L5 he believed it

1331
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,460
he differentiated he called the U.S the

1332
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,940
US five cut he said that there were only

1333
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,119
two true true breeding male lines in in

1334
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,639
everything that he got it was the nl1

1335
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,440
and the nl2 were the two male ones he

1336
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:49,679
had he had to work with I remember that

1337
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:53,579
and he called the the nl1 a pure Afghan

1338
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:56,098
and he called the nl2 a cush yeah a cush

1339
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:58,680
type you know based mainly on the smell

1340
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,140
of uh Juniper but and he said that the

1341
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:03,960
rest of them were a big hybrid mix and a

1342
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:05,219
mess yeah yeah but they were labeled I

1343
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,019
think he might have said that they they

1344
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,699
came labeled as this and that and the

1345
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:11,358
other thing and they tended to run true

1346
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:14,279
to what the description said they would

1347
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,960
and I might be mixing that up but I

1348
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,780
think that's what he wound up saying

1349
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,179
that you know some some would be more

1350
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,800
narrow Leaf than the others you know

1351
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:25,259
based on what they've been outcrossed

1352
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,318
with hybrids but as I understood it

1353
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,900
Neville he had the five clone right from

1354
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:33,179
from Greg and crew well he got it he got

1355
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,200
that later after he had done his own

1356
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:38,940
selection of of Neville's five because

1357
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:41,460
regardless when he got it he didn't like

1358
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:43,920
theirs so much according to him and he

1359
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,838
made his own cross that he called nl5

1360
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,059
using the Steve Murphy Afghan and what

1361
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:51,480
his Mazar or the Steve Murphy Afghan

1362
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:53,700
cross to the Hawaiian cross to his Mazar

1363
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,619
or something like that so there's a cool

1364
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:58,019
story they agree when they finally when

1365
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:00,000
when they got the nl5 Clone that they

1366
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:02,519
had selected from America and he got to

1367
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,460
Amsterdam apparently they sent it over

1368
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:07,858
in a terrarium full of plants and in

1369
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,960
order to get the Clone over there they

1370
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:13,139
took a pair of scissors and they cut off

1371
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:17,699
all of the serrations on every leaf of

1372
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:18,779
the nl5 No No Greg um I I asked Greg

1373
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:21,598
this story

1374
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,359
he said no they took it to a florist who

1375
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,680
made a flower pot type thing and they

1376
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:26,578
just stuck that in there he said he

1377
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,460
didn't know anything about the

1378
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:31,260
serrations interesting maybe maybe it is

1379
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,139
yeah they might have the florist might

1380
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,700
have done it one thing that

1381
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:37,318
Greg mentioned that that Matt and I

1382
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:39,719
never knew whether to believe or not was

1383
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:42,900
Greg always Greg said in this one post

1384
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:45,179
one time on Mr Nice in fact that

1385
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,980
um the nl1 was actually Steve Murphy

1386
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:49,919
afghan that he had gotten from Steve

1387
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,119
Murphy combined with a Neville Afghan he

1388
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,760
got from Neville

1389
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,579
right and people speculate all the time

1390
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,040
about which of Neville's afghan that was

1391
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:01,559
that was used to make the cross and

1392
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,358
Neville never answered the question so

1393
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,099
you know for anybody to say it's this

1394
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,719
one or that one you know what there's no

1395
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:08,818
evidence to support it you're just

1396
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,759
there's one there's like one or two

1397
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:13,558
people I can ask that may know but not

1398
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,660
more than that and even they I doubt

1399
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,760
they'd know that one right

1400
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:19,558
yeah but that's that's one of those ones

1401
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,420
that the people who are saying those

1402
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,859
things say it with such conviction that

1403
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,139
it sounds like that you know they were

1404
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:28,460
there when it happened but yeah you know

1405
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:31,799
it's so yeah the nl1 is supposed to be

1406
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,960
uh the the Steve Murphy Afghan times

1407
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,300
some other athies from Neville

1408
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,099
apparently but who knows what what it

1409
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,260
was

1410
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:41,880
um it was the purest and the interest

1411
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,160
the interesting part about the

1412
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,338
interesting part about that is that you

1413
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,139
know if you look at like Neville's nl1

1414
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:50,578
um every time he tried to make a back

1415
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,379
Cross or every time he tried to

1416
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:55,980
stabilize something that was from clone

1417
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:58,200
he always used nl1 pollen to start the

1418
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,960
process yeah because he said that it was

1419
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,818
the only pure Afghan line he had that

1420
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,139
was reliable

1421
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:06,779
um and everything else he had that was

1422
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:09,480
an amazing Afghan he got mostly in Clone

1423
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,960
form nothing will devolve every show

1424
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,699
into a show about Neville

1425
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,039
everything I mean we were talking you

1426
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,199
know Sunday up what the hell yeah he's

1427
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,838
like he's like forums yeah well let's do

1428
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,980
it

1429
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:25,558
it does suck because we were also

1430
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,300
mentioning to get it back to the forums

1431
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:30,180
um the reason why we sort of lost

1432
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,920
Neville on Mr Nice was him and Shanti

1433
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:34,379
behind the scenes kind of got into a

1434
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,900
tiff with each other over money and

1435
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,660
access and seeds and this and that and

1436
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,400
Neville got mad and left I will I will

1437
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,259
actually say exactly what happened

1438
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,240
because I was there and he told me

1439
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,859
exactly and he's no longer with us so

1440
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:49,379
I'll tell people his opinion because he

1441
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:52,619
was very adamant about this he said he

1442
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:56,700
sold Shanti the seeds uh when he did for

1443
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:59,280
I want to say 250 000 or 150 000 so that

1444
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:02,879
one I can't quite recall and he felt

1445
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,519
that when he came back in 2010 that

1446
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,680
Shanti had more than made a fair share

1447
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,480
of profit and that he felt he was still

1448
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,578
owed even though that wasn't a part of

1449
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,039
the deal he felt he was still owed that

1450
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:16,859
money because Shanti had capitalized

1451
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,259
very well on his work well not just his

1452
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:21,239
work but his name his name and that that

1453
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,640
was the main thing yeah his reputation

1454
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:26,098
is everything he'd been making it sound

1455
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,440
like those two were you know back in the

1456
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:31,140
rooms together doing selections and

1457
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,818
shaking the males you know I mean listen

1458
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:34,679
that wasn't happening you know it was

1459
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:36,420
Shanty working with Neville's stuff

1460
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,879
occasionally they'd exchanged a message

1461
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,460
or so you know like how do I find a

1462
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,019
skunk one plant that doesn't suck yeah

1463
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,900

he was just in in at the same time

1466
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,440
that the opinion of a lot of people

1467
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:57,298
there was that Shanti was not as upset

1468
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,798
or not as stoked

1469
00:58:57,298 --> 00:58:59,639
with all the attention Neville was

1470
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:01,519
getting

1471
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,139
um

1472
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,119
yeah he wasn't back online you're like

1473
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:08,578
oh my God yeah one thing that we could

1474
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,200
maybe ask Mad Jack and and raho when you

1475
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:12,839
guys first started getting online and

1476
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:14,639
first started looking at forums what was

1477
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:16,019
the kind of information or the kind of

1478
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,960
stuff you were seeing that like really

1479
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:21,358
excited you or like changed you know

1480
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,639
like because I mean it's different for

1481
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,900
all of us you know but like what was

1482
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:26,400
like you know when you're perusing

1483
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,380
different threads and seeing different

1484
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,000
things were you after history were you

1485
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,579
excited by some of the new stuff you

1486
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,500
were seeing people post uh was it the

1487
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:36,839
ability to connect and start direct

1488
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,659
messaging with others because it sounds

1489
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:41,578
like you guys built your friendship

1490
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:43,798
um off of the forums

1491
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:45,720
you know

1492
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:48,480
something interesting about the forms

1493
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:51,118
that we haven't mentioned is that um

1494
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,740
there's a good number of people as

1495
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:58,798
myself too that were um banned I was

1496
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:01,259
banned from icmag and I was

1497
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:04,259
you know I was

1498
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,720
actively moved down to get banned I was

1499
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:10,980
actively recruiting super nice people

1500
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:14,338
and people who I liked for another forum

1501
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,920
and it was a small form and since we're

1502
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:19,920
talking about forms then one day I came

1503
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,260
to go get on icmag and it it wouldn't

1504
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,420
let me on and I found out from other

1505
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,579
people were there saying oh you're

1506
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:29,579
you're your threat is still here old

1507
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:33,420
school Arizona I said but I can't get in

1508
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:36,420
there so I talked to I actually emailed

1509
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,338
Tom Hill somehow I don't remember how he

1510
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,599
did yeah Thompson straighten things out

1511
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:41,599
send Tom in there

1512
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:48,659
we need the voice of reason and I got

1513
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:51,119
back in and oh wow and he did something

1514
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:53,098
I don't know what it was and it lasted

1515
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,099
for about two more weeks and then I was

1516
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:58,500
gone again for good and one of the

1517
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:00,480
people the only way it happened but one

1518
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,980
of the people that I was recruiting or

1519
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:06,240
asking if they'd like to to join this

1520
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:09,119
other forum narked on me and my snatched

1521
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:12,179
well how how else would it happen yeah

1522
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,559
and I never figured out who that was or

1523
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:15,838
they were reading DMs like they always

1524
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,760
did but anyway I I waited a year and

1525
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,219
then I went back on under a different

1526
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,799
name and I was concerned that maybe they

1527
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:25,019
were tracking IP addresses and they'd go

1528
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,659
oh here's magic trying to sneak back on

1529
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:30,599
but they weren't and I've been on since

1530
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:32,818
then I go on about every six months I

1531
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:34,980
went on today because my ex-grow partner

1532
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:36,960
I was telling Matt earlier

1533
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,599
release the information about the book

1534
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,639
he wrote called year of the magic and

1535
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,318
it's it's a fictional story that uses

1536
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:46,379
our experiences

1537
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:52,259
and he uh

1538
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:53,579

1543
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:06,119
giving you a tab of something that you

1544

is using the name mad space capital j a

1551
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:29,279
g and I just posted a little link on

1552
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:30,838
there to my mag.com website because five

1553
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,140
people have the right to use the name

1554
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:37,199
magic and I and I talk about that on my

1555
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:41,098
website because they were people who who

1556
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:42,899
grew with me and they they deserve it

1557
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:45,240

years with me and the two big years when

1559
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:51,838

lives in Taos and he has for years 40

1561
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:57,599
years now I think and

1562
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,199

1563

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,179
the year year of the magic okay yeah and

1572
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,240
what's the author's name

1573
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:29,699
uh John Slater

1574
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,879
s-l-a-t-o-r there you go and it's j-o-n

1575
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:35,338
just John Slater

1576
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:37,798
John John Morton the BBC for 10 years

1577
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:40,578
before he came to the U.S and when I

1578
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:43,440
tried to get him on the on a

1579
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:46,980
particular Forum since we're speaking

1580
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,980
about forums he was the fact that he was

1581
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,838
into movies and filmed all sorts of

1582
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,880
people got very paranoid and saying yeah

1583
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,039
well what if he starts taking on our

1584
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,640
photos and posting them and putting them

1585
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:01,798
in a documentary so he didn't he wasn't

1586
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:04,858
allowed to join yeah

1587
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:06,780
because he had too much and it's so

1588
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:08,759
ridiculous you know when somebody when

1589
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,760
somebody first comes on the forums it's

1590
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:14,160
like John did you know back then the

1591
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,960
author uh it's it's weird you know

1592
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,598
because you're first all of a sudden

1593
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,760
you're inundated with real live people's

1594
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,619
opinions about these products and maybe

1595
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,140
you've been looking at High Times or

1596
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:28,980
whatever all you've seen is advertising

1597
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:31,618
information yeah glossy pictures you

1598
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:34,079
know maybe some pretty girls you know

1599
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:36,420
they they mix it all up to hit you from

1600
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,579
every angle and and then it's got an

1601
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,440
exciting story about some Intrepid

1602
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,780
adventurers climbing up into the

1603
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,480
freaking Himalayas and battling the yeti

1604
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:48,240
to steal his seed stash and I mean it

1605
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,519
just goes on and on and and you believe

1606
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,858
it and then you get there and there's

1607
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:56,579
half of the crowd on on the Forum that

1608
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:59,578
you've decided to read is saying that's

1609
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:02,700
all lies and the other half of the crowd

1610
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:05,460
is saying it's all true you know yeah um

1611
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:08,159
but you immediately realize that you

1612
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,980
know it's neither it's neither all or

1613
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:13,679
all or all true or all false but man

1614
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:16,260
that's kind of an eye-opener and and

1615
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:19,500
then you know the whole experience of

1616
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:22,079
like like group dynamics you know where

1617
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,818
people will align up around one color

1618
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,760
you know we're the we're for the red

1619
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:30,119
seeds you know no we only grow blue

1620
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,819
seeds around here it's uh just just a

1621
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:35,280
horrible thing but

1622
01:05:31,818 --> 01:05:37,798
so your question I got on because I

1623
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,798
wanted to see what was out there in the

1624
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:42,539
whole weed world I knew it from my

1625
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,000
perspective in the people I knew in

1626
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:47,880
Arizona but and

1627
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,420
other places but I just had no idea that

1628
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,400
it was so expansive and when I saw Mr

1629
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:56,338
Nice seeds and all the things that were

1630
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,559
possible I bought some seeds in the uh

1631
01:05:56,338 --> 01:06:00,719
auctions they had yeah that were in

1632
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,660
Switzerland I believe they were mailed

1633
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,879
from Switzerland and

1634
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:10,078
um they got through fine so it was kind

1635
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:14,539
of cool were they in were they in straws

1636
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,539
oh wow I think they were

1637
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,400
yeah no one of the one of the ways that

1638
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:22,139
Shanti like those guys like to send

1639
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,900
things was they would put seeds in in

1640
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:27,719
like a plastic straw write the name on

1641
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:30,838
the straw and then burn or seal the ends

1642
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:32,399
of the straw itself yeah and and uh

1643
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:35,519
that's just why I asked because I've

1644
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,858
gotten straw you know corrugated seeds

1645
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:40,679
I've gotten lots of lots of straws from

1646
01:06:37,858 --> 01:06:42,719
Shanty and I ordered um from him before

1647
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:45,179
the auctions even if we want to date

1648
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:47,879
stamp it and you know before we even

1649
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,679
started auctions and and I got them in

1650
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,740
straws even then did you did you ever

1651
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:55,679
used to get um shanti's old private

1652
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:57,179
email lists of his seeds that was good

1653
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,098
yeah I was trying to dig up one for not

1654
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:01,199
so because he had never seen one of his

1655
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:02,460
old like when you were um if you're one

1656
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,558
of the Breeders that was on a site

1657
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,019
during like that Neville era he would

1658
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,000
share a list with some people of the

1659
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:12,119
like one-off crosses and stuff he made

1660
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,219
you know you could buy some people yeah

1661
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:16,079
so like I I've been trying to find one

1662
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:18,899
of these old lists because I had a bunch

1663
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,480
but I don't have them anymore speaking

1664
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,280
of uh just uh just to fill in a little

1665
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,900
bit speaking of magic talking about

1666
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,720
getting banned

1667
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:30,059
um yeah there was uh there was a lot of

1668
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:32,399
ways that people got banned uh some of

1669
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:34,980
it was you started talking about a

1670
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,599
narrative that the owners or people that

1671
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,260
were connected to the owners of the site

1672
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:41,519
didn't agree with uh that could happen

1673
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:43,140
sometimes it was just you would get on

1674
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:44,940
and start talking your truth and then

1675
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:46,440
you'd be immediately crapped on by a

1676
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,019
bunch of different people calling you a

1677
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,659
liar and calling you names let's face it

1678
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:53,400
like a lot of cannabis people like you

1679
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:55,618
know social interaction is not our

1680
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,420
strong suit right so you get online and

1681
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,160
you start typing out your truth or

1682
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,780
whatever and then a bun and then 20 kids

1683
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:03,058
are insulting you and telling you you're

1684
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,039
a dick and you get mad and then you

1685
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:07,380
start saying ruthless things back and

1686
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,380
then you know yeah that's the mat the

1687
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:12,119
mat version right

1688
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,039
um and and you know then you get banned

1689
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:15,838
for you know or your thread gets locked

1690
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:18,779
because it goes beyond let's talk about

1691
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:22,079
facts to like let's let's throw insults

1692
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:24,600
at one another until somebody cries yeah

1693
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,159
um and so you know forums were like and

1694
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,838
there's also the you know you talk about

1695
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:29,759
the keyboard Warrior thing where

1696
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:33,420
Anonymous people getting annoyed with

1697
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:36,600
each other can spit some pretty you know

1698
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,338
pretty heated stuff back and forth

1699
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,980
um and you know sometimes it's very

1700
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:43,318
difficult how do you you know there are

1701
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:45,238
some legitimate long-term liars and

1702
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:47,339
scammers that have used the forums to

1703
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,259
advance their interests and then there's

1704
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:51,000
also people like mad Jag or others

1705
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:53,579
coming out of the Shadows just telling

1706
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,140
truth and how sitting there in front of

1707
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:56,460
your computer do you differentiate

1708
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,440
between the two

1709
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:01,500
it can become quite hard and some of the

1710
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:03,719
scammers are extremely personable yeah

1711
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:06,000
and some of them are Elders in the

1712
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:07,798
community and and you know like you want

1713
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,600
to to trust your elders because that's

1714
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:11,819
how we're a lot of people are raised you

1715
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,920

1716
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:15,600
know Tom Hill or or hempy or different

1717
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,480
people where if you cross them the wrong

1718
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,819
way they're just gonna like you know uh

1719
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:24,298
they're just gonna write out a a a

1720
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:25,520
written evisceration they didn't have a

1721
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:28,920
lot of patience

1722
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:31,739
who went by the name weird I think Matt

1723
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,440
we talked about this but yeah he was

1724
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:37,559
always giving Tom Hill a hard time in

1725
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:39,298
the early years that I was like 2012 13

1726
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,940
14 yeah

1727
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:44,579
um and Tom would just let it happen but

1728
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:47,759
then when he came back like you said he

1729
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:49,619
would just pound the guy you know and

1730
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,659
there was some thought that weird was

1731
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,359
actually a woman I'm not too sure that's

1732
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:55,979
true but

1733
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,179
he was very intelligent he wasn't just

1734
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:59,819
like yeah

1735
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:02,699
saying you're a liar Tom or whatever but

1736
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:05,698
he he just wouldn't let go he was very

1737
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:07,678
much a bulldog Tom earned a knew he

1738
01:10:05,698 --> 01:10:09,960

1739
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,520

1741
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,179
on Instagram the other day that is

1742
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:18,119
convinced that he's gonna prove that

1743
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:21,600
Toms Hayes is a hybrid somehow I don't

1744
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:23,939
know great another another another Don

1745
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,159
Quixote there yeah helping at windmills

1746
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:27,960
yep

1747
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,059
um and yeah it's already that a lot of

1748
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,039
times people in cannabis are better with

1749
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,080
plants than they are with other people

1750
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:36,719
yeah and so you start interacting with

1751
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,519
other people you know and and it you

1752
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,960
know forms it's like it's hard to stick

1753
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,699
to the facts

1754
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,380
people get upset people don't like being

1755
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:45,178
called a liar people don't like being

1756
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,640
called this or that or whatever and then

1757
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:49,319
there's people that just doubt

1758
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,420
um or they they read other stuff and

1759
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:53,579
they get their facts wrong well you know

1760
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:55,440
the weird thing is like how long do you

1761
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:57,359
have to be online before you have your

1762
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,000

there and they're full of it and people

1784
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,619
get defensive and we just go on and on

1785
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:51,239
and on and on

1786
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:53,698
pages do you know the story of white

1787
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:54,839
widow very well the two competing

1788
01:11:53,698 --> 01:11:57,899
stories

1789
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:01,800
uh well one of them is that let's see

1790
01:11:57,899 --> 01:12:02,839
there's a Brazilian sativa and manga

1791
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,179
Rosa

1792
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:08,699
Rosa and the Corolla a random app

1793
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:11,640
there's a random Affy in there somewhere

1794
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:15,059
in one of the stories yeah and and the

1795
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:18,739
Kerala yes so and then it's that's

1796
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:22,380
Verner right or or ingomar the shame

1797
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:24,959
there you go ingamar or Shanti one of

1798
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:27,539
those two both of them claim to be the

1799
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,880
the Creator correct

1800
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:32,219
um and I believe Shanty has a little bit

1801
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,500
more detail in his in his description

1802
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:36,480
about how it came to be the other one is

1803
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,819
just kind of like well I woke up one

1804
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:41,698
morning and I pissed out White Widow

1805
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:43,679
yeah it was um it was a it was a like a

1806
01:12:41,698 --> 01:12:45,299
hash Bean if I remember correctly in one

1807
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,039
of the in ingomar De Shaman's story was

1808
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,900
that a bean in a hash if I remember

1809
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:51,899
correctly there's something called the

1810
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:53,519
plank p-l-a-n-c-k which is some kind of

1811
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:55,679
Colombia or not maybe it wasn't

1812
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,860
Colombian something like Brazilian and

1813
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,480
they and I think he did say Corolla as

1814
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:02,339
well and I believe he traveled to India

1815
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,500
to get his as well just like Shanti did

1816
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,800
and they both magically came back with

1817
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:09,479
this same exact or not exact but similar

1818
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,179
parentage hybrid with the same exact

1819
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:13,919
name my experience at the same time the

1820
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,980
people in Amsterdam tended to believe

1821
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,440
ingmar and the people online tended to

1822
01:13:16,979 --> 01:13:21,359
believe Shanti uh it's definitely

1823
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:23,399
indisputable that Shanti is the first

1824
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:25,920
person to release a seed line to the

1825
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:28,139
public using that name

1826
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:31,199
um and this and it does appear that the

1827
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:33,119
you know all the Hybrids you know and

1828
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,399
things like that that started dominating

1829
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:38,760
the cups like the White Widow and the in

1830
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:41,339
the great white shark and Rhino yeah

1831
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:45,020
right and you know even like Peacemaker

1832
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,020
yeah peace peacemakers

1833
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,519
no I don't think so yeah ingomar's

1834
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:52,140
Peacemaker

1835
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,360
yeah I think these guys all ripped each

1836
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,520
other off and everything said most of

1837
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:58,738
the people trying to find a good guy on

1838
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,600
that list is just it's it's you know I

1839
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:02,279
mean I don't I don't I don't condemn

1840
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,560
them for it or anything but there's a

1841
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,300
lot of money involved I mean there you

1842
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,980
know I remember because I was a young

1843
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,900
kid I was you know I was a young adult

1844
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,479
then I'll say you know barely barely

1845
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:13,979
legal if you will and uh getting those

1846
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:16,859
High Times and they would have these

1847
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:20,819
high glossy photos of all the winners

1848
01:14:16,859 --> 01:14:23,339
yeah 95 96 97 and all that and you'd see

1849
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:25,019
the AK-47 and the White Widow and the

1850
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,119
right Rhino and the great white shark

1851
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:29,520
and they won and they were like the best

1852
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:32,519
weed out there and

1853
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,500
um you know uh those kind of strains

1854
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,000
started dominating so it was like they

1855
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,359
probably made milk they probably sold

1856
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,399
just umpteenth million seeds based off

1857
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:43,319
those spreads so many people from

1858
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:44,939
America coming to Holland looking for

1859
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:47,059
those exact strains that they saw in

1860
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:51,000
High Times so there was a lot lot of

1861
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:53,120
monetary battling going on over you know

1862
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,859
over access in that in that regard

1863
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,019
marketing the marketing Legends were

1864
01:14:55,859 --> 01:15:01,319
were the difference between you know

1865
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:03,900
first and last

1866
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:06,359
um yeah I mean I would any and even even

1867
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:09,839
when if we're talking about the forums

1868
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:12,119
to Trail it back to that again like the

1869
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,340
I would say that the forums are really

1870
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:16,800
what made DJ Short and his blueberry

1871
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:20,699
work famous it's what made the original

1872
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:23,400
Brothers Grim with the Cindy 99 and uh

1873
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:25,619
and all that very famous you know Vic

1874
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:27,359
High's work back then

1875
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:29,640
um some of some of the smaller breeders

1876
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:33,539
that were just getting started

1877
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:36,060
um a good long 200 Page thread on

1878
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:37,920
something could spark a career

1879
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,900
on some of those early forums because

1880
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,100
there wasn't that many people doing it I

1881
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:42,599
mean I remember looking at all that

1882
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,699
blueberry work and being like I never

1883
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,400
see any weed that looks like that that's

1884
01:15:44,698 --> 01:15:49,019
crazy looking yeah let's go spend a

1885
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:50,939
couple of thousand dollars and then does

1886
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,800
it smell like fruit does it smell like

1887
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:55,259
it looks why does it look like that and

1888
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,600
then there was a time we've talked about

1889
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:59,579
this on a previous podcast but we I used

1890
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,800
to go to these parties

1891
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:05,300
um that were basically a gathering of a

1892
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:09,320
lot of these people that had met online

1893
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:11,760
is that how the party went and yeah

1894
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:14,219
not quite but I thought this was a

1895
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,159
different podcast it's uh no not quite

1896
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:19,079
but they but everything when I was

1897
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:21,059
hoping to find a bunch of like ancient

1898
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:25,079
varieties there and like everything was

1899
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:27,539
crossed with blue work white work Sweet

1900
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:31,380
Tooth you know it was all those early

1901
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:32,819
2000s famous you know breeder Steve DJ

1902
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,920
Short

1903

um you know white widow white family all

1904
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,500
that because those were the big seeds of

1905
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,480
the time and it was also

1906
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:46,020
pre-reversals and pre-feminized work

1907
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:47,759
so it was all kind of normal stuff

1908
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:49,560
you know I was hoping to find a bunch of

1909
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,079
ancient stuff and it was all the most at

1910

01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:17,399
Cindy 99 the first edition of of

1921
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:19,738
Brothers Grimm when it was Sly and Mr

1922
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:21,899
Soul those guys were very famous on the

1923
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:24,539
early forums yeah and then they then

1924
01:17:21,899 --> 01:17:26,939
they disappeared and it's like the the

1925
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,158
demand for their seeds increased when

1926
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:32,399
they were no longer around which had

1927
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:34,979
that that whole uh phenomenon of you

1928
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,059
know creating a whole bunch of new

1929
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:39,299
people

1930
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:42,360
you know making their f2s f3s of of

1931
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:44,460
Cindy 99 and discovering holy crap this

1932
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:48,059
stuff breeds true

1933
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:49,380
or like the the Dutch Flowers group

1934
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:51,239
um they were some of the first people

1935
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,699
that were they would they would write

1936
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:56,218
online like what I consider now to be

1937
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:58,500
like professional ad copy

1938
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:00,539
uh you know of their strains and it was

1939
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,399
very done and it was designed to elicit

1940
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:04,439
emotions and feelings and they would

1941
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,359
write extensively about how amazing it

1942
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:08,099
was yeah and they would do that for

1943
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:09,179
weeks or months and get everybody hyped

1944
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,860
and tell them they didn't have enough

1945
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:12,600
seed to give everyone and then they

1946
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:14,698
would release their seed online and it

1947
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:18,120
would sell out instantly and they would

1948
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:19,859
do that every time huh

1949
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:22,859
how about the first

1950
01:18:19,859 --> 01:18:25,139
first seed sellers that were massive

1951
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:27,658
like World of seeds where you could go

1952
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:30,900
on there in Great Britain and they had

1953
01:18:27,658 --> 01:18:33,359
they had every other Seed Company you

1954
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:35,698
know they represented just hundreds and

1955
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,158
hundreds I remember one of my first was

1956
01:18:35,698 --> 01:18:40,198
seed Madness that was real big from the

1957
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:43,439
UK it was seed Madness they had everyone

1958
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:46,379
remember Heaven's stairway yeah that was

1959
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:48,299
that was earlier before the UK slam

1960
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:50,579
haven't I didn't realize it at the time

1961
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,500
but Heaven's stairway was tied into both

1962
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:55,260
overgrown cannabis world

1963
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:58,140
and so when they got raided

1964
01:18:55,260 --> 01:19:00,179
um both of those forums went down yeah

1965
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,980
because I didn't realize it at the time

1966
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:03,840
but that was that was the that was the

1967
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:06,059
group they were all the same it was all

1968
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,739
different facets of the same the same

1969
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,880
same group I think it would be

1970
01:19:07,738 --> 01:19:10,919
interesting to talk to Richard

1971
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,420
Calrissian now

1972
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,039
um if he would

1973
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,899
um his name's well known I don't mind

1974
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:17,519
saying it you know the old owner of

1975
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:19,439
Heaven Stairway

1976
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,640
um it would be very interesting to talk

1977
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:22,319
to him because he would have a lot of

1978
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,760
answers about Dutch Flowers and a lot of

1979
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:25,738
other companies that are very vague

1980
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,360
because he worked with everyone the only

1981
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:29,218
time I've ever got info on Dutch Flowers

1982
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:33,719
oddly enough was from Charles Scott

1983
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:34,739
reefer man and he was who kind of gave

1984
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:35,939
me info on it but I don't want to repeat

1985
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:39,059
it because I don't even know if it's

1986
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:41,219
true coming from him but I will say that

1987
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:43,260
like Dutch Flowers they would write this

1988
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:45,359
ad copy and they would just write like

1989
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,920
descriptions of strains that went on and

1990
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:48,299
on and on and on and by the time you

1991
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,399
were done reading it you were just ready

1992
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,079
to spend a thousand dollars out of your

1993
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:53,879
pocket as soon as they would let you to

1994
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,079
get as many of them as you could and

1995
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,400
then they'd sell out and you couldn't

1996
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:58,140
get them and there'd be people online

1997
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,899
laughing that they got some and all

1998
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:02,640
stoked and it was like unbelievable how

1999
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:06,960
much they were willing they were able to

2000
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:08,880
build momentum for each seed drop yeah

2001
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,219
and they reminded me of

2002
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,679
that reminded me of alien genetics when

2003
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:17,520
they came out on the farm in like in

2004
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:19,380
2011 2012-13 like it was just like every

2005
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:21,179
drop they did was just like thousand

2006
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,980
dollars a pack two thousand dollars a

2007
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:25,859
pack every time and nobody knew who they

2008
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:27,479
were but nobody cared you know it's

2009
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:29,219
really expensive and there's not enough

2010
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:31,019
for everyone but we're gonna drop it at

2011
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:33,000
this time and you can all fight over it

2012
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,980
and it would really and it was like it's

2013
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,539
a it's a cool way of like how human

2014
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:38,339
nature works when you hear something

2015
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:40,619
that's rare and desirable and you see

2016
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:42,360
other people posting about how bad they

2017
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:44,279
want it and you want it it's only going

2018
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:46,859
to be there for a minute and you're just

2019
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:50,420
like take my money please yeah yep it

2020
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:53,639
was really clever Herbie's Head Shop

2021
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:56,158
as the largest UK cannabis seed bank

2022
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:59,219
back then too yeah I'm looking at a list

2023
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:02,759
I have all these bookmarks in my Firefox

2024
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:05,520
and some of these hyper samias in Spain

2025
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,679
I bought some from in

2026
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,000
whatever you bought a bunch from them

2027
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:13,079
and they didn't pop right the

2028
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,819
hypersamians well I I no I got my first

2029
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:17,600
packet came with a footprint on it

2030
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:20,880
that's right that's right that's right

2031
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,980
and these people were nice enough to I

2032
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,500
didn't even have a a way of making a

2033
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:27,178
digital photo to send to them but they

2034
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:30,000
they believe me and they said it again

2035
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:33,000
and I got them but someone in the post

2036
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,738
office you know just you can tell you

2037
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,779
can tell that Herbie's a good guy from

2038
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:38,519
that picture of him on those their ads

2039
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:39,800
with the dreadlocks and everything he

2040
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,239
looks real cool

2041
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,460
that's got that's got to be herbie right

2042
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:46,559
right

2043
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:49,439
I thought that was him

2044
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,300
so uh yeah I mean and then then you had

2045
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:54,779
these people who wrote These Legend

2046
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:58,440
stories right like like the origin of

2047
01:21:54,779 --> 01:22:00,059
skunk one yeah it's like a novel you

2048
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:01,579
know it's like a short it's like a short

2049
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:04,620
fiction book

2050
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:07,198
Empty seeds did them Scentsy seeds had

2051
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:09,719
great lungs yeah it was like I remember

2052
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,419
I remember Jessie's pretty well for Mr

2053
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:13,980
Nice yeah

2054
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:15,539
I thought Jesse wrote those and the

2055
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:18,299
thing is the Scentsy ones are almost

2056
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:20,219
identical yeah which made me think holy

2057
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,440
crap was he actually working for both

2058
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:25,380
both sides of the battle you know what

2059
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:28,259
is it wouldn't that be funny yeah if you

2060
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:30,300
remember Jesse posted fake pictures of

2061
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:33,420
UK cheese as the head picture for UK

2062
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,440
cheese too it was a little cuisio

2063
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,880
um I always get it wrong I would say

2064
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:37,879
it's white skunk but it's like white

2065
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:44,939
he had a whole series on Mr Nice where

2066
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:46,800
he would come out with a lot of the

2067
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:49,198
original strains and these extremely

2068
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,360
long and detailed stories told with

2069
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:55,379
utter confidence about where they came

2070
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:57,420
from yeah and uh you know it it uh you

2071
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,279
know it's uh sometimes they say like in

2072
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,619
news it's better to be first than to be

2073
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,658
right yeah you know

2074
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:06,119
um and that is the case online as well

2075
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:08,579
get your tail out there

2076
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:10,319
um and and and and get repetition going

2077
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:12,658
on and defend it and then eventually

2078
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:15,238
it'll burrow in and become part of the

2079
01:23:12,658 --> 01:23:18,539
fabric of the story cannabis ear worms

2080
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:20,939
and then and then some people on uh on

2081
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:23,158
your podcast will invite you on to

2082
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:24,919
explain how that story doesn't make any

2083
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:27,539
sense anymore

2084
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,219
you know you know what's funny is one of

2085
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:30,960
the decisions that Matt and I made about

2086
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:33,119
the podcast and the reason we started

2087
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,579
talking about old stuff from the 70s and

2088
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,779
80s first was because there was less

2089
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:39,000
people that were going to get super

2090
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:41,519
offended and fight with us instantly

2091
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,800
about telling what we know because it

2092
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,719
goes against what benefits them or

2093
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,460
they're making money on some angle on it

2094
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:49,260
or whatever

2095
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,399
um there's uh there's very there's only

2096
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,380
so many people that are actually

2097
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,000
interested in cannabis history most of

2098
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:56,760
them are interested in making themselves

2099
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,840
look good and making money CSI often

2100
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,079
reminds me

2101
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:03,119
that we are weirdos because we actually

2102
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:04,679
give a [ __ ] about what's in our weed

2103
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:08,340
like we are the we are the actual

2104
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:10,380
weirdos that care enough to Archive to

2105
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,179
really delve into what's in strains and

2106
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,739
then what's in those parents what that's

2107
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:15,060
weirdo people stuff and we're those

2108
01:24:13,738 --> 01:24:17,579
people and he reminds me all the time

2109
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,560
Matt not everybody cares like that it's

2110
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:24,500
kind of weird that we care like that so

2111
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,500
it keeps in perspective you know so yeah

2112
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,739
it's a minority a dying minority that

2113
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:31,399
are uh genuinely interested in strains

2114
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:34,039
it could be growing minority you know

2115
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:37,979
why does it have to be a dying mind

2116
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:40,260
because I I really know I I'll disagree

2117
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:42,899
on that one strongly because I use this

2118
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,760
analogy all the time but like I kind of

2119
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:47,279
think cannabis right now is where like

2120
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:48,840
wine was in the 70s where it's like

2121
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:50,880
people know for the most part they know

2122
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,800
about white and red and what they know

2123
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,199
about red is red goes with like pot

2124
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,659
roast and it's like deeper and like men

2125
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,698
drink it and white wine goes with fish

2126
01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:02,219
or it's like your lady likes it it's not

2127
01:24:59,698 --> 01:25:04,259
as like it's not as robust and then

2128
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:07,140
that's really what people knew mostly

2129
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:09,000
about wine in the 70s right and then you

2130
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,699
fast forward with 30 or 40 years of

2131
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,859
education and people are talking about I

2132
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:16,079
like my Cabernet Sauvignon from this

2133
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:18,658
appellation in Napa or this part of

2134
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,819
Mendocino County or I like it from here

2135
01:25:18,658 --> 01:25:23,759
and these guys that make wine these

2136
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:26,158
Vintners are my favorites and there's so

2137
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,199
much depth now and you have like someone

2138
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,719
yes that come to the table at fancy

2139
01:25:28,198 --> 01:25:32,639
restaurants and explain the nuances of

2140
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,579
these expensive bottles they want you to

2141
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:38,520
buy and so I think cannabis will go in

2142
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:41,579
that Direct action for some percentage

2143
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:44,940
of the market there's going to be a

2144
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:47,579
great desire for information it's just

2145
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:50,099
we're in its infancy and so now people

2146
01:25:47,579 --> 01:25:51,300
are fighting over the history

2147
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,860
um you know because it's going to become

2148
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:56,039
more important and people are going to

2149
01:25:52,859 --> 01:25:57,539
want you know marketing stories too you

2150
01:25:56,039 --> 01:25:59,819
know they're going to want to sell their

2151
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:02,519
version of things makes sense to me

2152
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:04,920
market trends yep

2153
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:07,199
so all everything you just said sounds

2154
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:09,179
right on I you know the question would

2155
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:11,698
be is that percentage that are

2156
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:13,920
connoisseurs that are willing to spend

2157
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:16,079
the extra for the good stuff if you if

2158
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,779
you compare it to the uh to the alcohol

2159
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,639
business model you know that the

2160
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:23,099
majority of people are going to buy you

2161
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:24,679
know the cheap beer that that you know

2162
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:28,320
they get the best bang for the buck

2163
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:30,600
other people uh you know become you know

2164
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:33,599
like to get the good stuff they they

2165
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,159
drink in moderation and savor it and you

2166
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,800
know make a big deal out of it whatever

2167
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:40,079
same thing with same thing with cannabis

2168
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,679
except

2169
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:42,899
um

2170
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:45,420
you know there's just there's so much

2171
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:47,158
some cannabis and alcohol aren't aren't

2172
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:49,199
the same right I mean you drink you

2173
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:51,000
drink a gallon of one kind you drink a

2174
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:52,819
gallon of the other you're gonna be just

2175
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,020
as dead either way

2176
01:26:52,819 --> 01:26:57,299
but you know with cannabis the

2177
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:59,280
differences are so great between one

2178
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:01,860
strainer another so it's it's not

2179
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:04,920
exactly the same you know it's not like

2180
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:08,819
10 10 hits of bad wheat is not the same

2181
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:10,560
as one good hit yeah you know and

2182
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:12,179
there's and even if it's just a small

2183
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,500
percentage that's interested in what

2184
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:15,619
we're interested in that has the

2185
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,539
potential to still be millions of people

2186
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:20,639
spread out over over you know a wide

2187
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:22,859
area of humans you know well that's

2188
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,199
where those numbers grow is by the Gen

2189
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:27,899
the increase in number of people who

2190
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:30,000
smoke in general yeah right I think that

2191
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:31,738
the 20 if we're going to think the 20

2192
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,800
are ever going to give a [ __ ] about

2193
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:36,839
about quality

2194
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,420
um you know then that that number how do

2195
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:43,020
we grow that number of 20 so that you

2196
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:45,239
know an army of of old school Hill he'll

2197
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,800
you know boys from the hill can keep

2198
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:49,319
making a living off of their special

2199
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:52,739
their special stuff I have thoughts on

2200
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:54,479
that too because coming from like being

2201
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:56,519
like a Grateful Dead hippie when I was

2202
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:58,500
young and all that like when I was

2203
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,900
younger the only place you could get

2204
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:04,859
organic food was basically like crunchy

2205
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:06,960
co-ops and odd places right and then you

2206
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:08,698
I'd like to say that it was like us that

2207
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,800
pushed it forward but we really didn't

2208
01:28:08,698 --> 01:28:12,419
who really pushed it Forward was like

2209
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,520
there was some yuppies and some

2210
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:16,739
wealthier people and they're like you

2211
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,900
know I drive a European sports car I

2212
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:21,419
wear these really nice shoes I wear

2213
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:23,119
tailored suits why don't I have a nicer

2214
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:25,739
grade a foot

2215
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:27,300
you know and and there's going to be a

2216
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:28,738
whole group of people that get into it

2217
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,119
and they're going to want a nicer grade

2218
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:33,238
because everything they also they have

2219
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:34,738
in life is nice right right like that's

2220
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:36,178
just how you know they have nice wine

2221
01:28:34,738 --> 01:28:37,799
they have nice shoes they have nice

2222
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:40,859
belts they have a nice car they live in

2223
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,960
a nice zip code you know uh all those

2224
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:44,460
different types of things and as you

2225
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,139
know some percentage of them are going

2226
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:47,340
to get interested in in cannabis and

2227
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:48,960
they're going to want high-grade

2228
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,840
cannabis because they get high grade

2229
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:54,239
everything yep

2230
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,159
you know and that's why they're the

2231
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,319
reason why you can go into any grocery

2232
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:01,019
store these days and there's at least a

2233
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:04,139
small organic section

2234
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,420
you know yeah well and plus you know one

2235
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:08,699
difference between food and cannabis is

2236
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:11,158
food food would be

2237
01:29:08,698 --> 01:29:14,399
described as an essential right you have

2238
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:16,198
to have it to live cannabis is is not

2239
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:19,379
um necessarily unless you use it for

2240
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:21,238
medicine that sure but again you know

2241
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,679
you don't need Italian leather shoes to

2242
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:24,559
live you got a lot of people buy them

2243
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:27,359
yeah

2244
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,560
you know wow and if they don't fit you

2245
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:33,899
have to acquit also yeah

2246
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:37,080
those Bruno Molly well I don't know what

2247
01:29:33,899 --> 01:29:39,179
I'm talking about first out of my price

2248
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:41,158
range this might have to get edited but

2249
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:42,960
Matt I have to bail in a second oh

2250
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,519
that's all right we're good right now we

2251
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,439
have about an hour and a half in and I

2252
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,440
know Rojo's got a bill soon too

2253
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:51,960
yeah all right so let's uh let's record

2254
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:53,339
some kind of exit

2255
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,920
okay

2256
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:59,279
go ahead not so if we're gonna record

2257
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:01,260
and exit uh I will just say that the

2258
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:04,019
forums were amazing because they were

2259
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,820
the first time that worldwide cannabis

2260
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:07,980
enthusiasts got to insult each other

2261
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:10,679
share information throw poop at each

2262
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:12,658
other fight about what the truth was and

2263
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:15,060
share their personal stories outside

2264
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:17,158
their own little friend group and for

2265
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:18,840
good and bad it totally changed how

2266
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:21,539
cannabis people interacted with each

2267
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,279
other it made a bunch of friendships it

2268
01:30:21,539 --> 01:30:25,859
made some enemies it turned something

2269
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:29,399
from very local for most people into

2270
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:31,439
Nation or even internationally wide it

2271
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:33,420
forged a bunch of friendships over a

2272
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,698
long period of time of people that met

2273
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:38,960
through forums and and direct messages

2274
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:41,759
and stuff like that and so technology

2275
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:43,859
combined with loosening laws in America

2276
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,539
that made people feel slightly more

2277
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:49,799
comfortable to get on and talk about

2278
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:51,899
things is really what sprung forward

2279
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,880
um you know a lot of information

2280
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:55,920
exchange

2281
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,900
um and I don't think any of the four

2282
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,880
people on here talking today would be

2283
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,738
talking without that

2284
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,779
internet advancement

2285
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:07,198
for lack of a better term that's why

2286
01:31:03,779 --> 01:31:10,619
we're we we've met each other yeah all

2287
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:10,619
four of us absolutely

2288
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:15,839
you know so I I say that like you know

2289
01:31:13,738 --> 01:31:17,638
that that change was a sea change

2290
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,980
because it brought together a lot of

2291
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:23,219
disparate groups of weed enthusiasts and

2292
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:25,138
allowed them to make friends or argue or

2293
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:27,300
both or whatever and and push

2294
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:29,760
information and history forward so um

2295
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:32,400
it's uh it's been a massive positive in

2296
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:36,119
my opinion and the massive number of new

2297
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:38,158
strains hybrids really was fostered on

2298
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:41,519
forums you know where people exchange

2299
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:43,138
seeds and sent you a private message and

2300
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,520
said well I've got these and you've got

2301
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:46,079
those and then next thing you know

2302
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:47,580
they're being crossed with another one

2303
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:49,939
and

2304
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:52,920
proliferating crazily

2305
01:31:49,939 --> 01:31:54,059
and also one thing I should say too that

2306
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,340
made me think of it when you were

2307
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:58,260
speaking is that it used to be before

2308
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,600
the forums and before the internet that

2309
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:02,639
it was only a very few number of seed

2310
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,219
bank seed companies that were allowed to

2311
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:07,739
sell stuff and when the forums came

2312
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:09,960
about a lot of private hobbyist breeders

2313
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:11,279
started being able to exchange their

2314
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:14,819
work with each other

2315
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:17,340
and as majag said that was revolutionary

2316
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:19,198
and pushed forward hybrids in a way that

2317
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,480
no one expected because it went from a

2318
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,698
few dozen companies to literally

2319
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:25,619
thousands of people exchanging their

2320
01:32:23,698 --> 01:32:28,439
work with each other of Their Own

2321
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:30,359
Private projects and and getting famous

2322
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:32,638
and some people got famous but even if

2323
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:35,219
they didn't it just spread the germ The

2324
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:37,920
Germ plasma around all over

2325
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:41,039
yeah thank goodness Sam and Rob Clark

2326
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:43,980
Booth told me that the only when I was

2327
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:47,819
asking them at a later date the only

2328
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:50,459
seed company or seed bank that they felt

2329
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:53,579
was legit with seedsman

2330
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:55,500
in in Amsterdam season

2331
01:32:53,579 --> 01:32:56,479
just for whatever it's worth

2332
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,439
it

2333
01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:00,899
yeah well they've sold a lot of stuff

2334
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:02,939
through seedsman and uh and they aren't

2335
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:05,099
one of the more widget houses out there

2336
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:06,779
that's for sure you know I think that

2337
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:09,900
the the internet

2338
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:12,119
allowed us to grow the community I mean

2339
01:33:09,899 --> 01:33:15,119
not so you were a deadhead you know went

2340
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:17,039
out on tour you know bought bought

2341
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:19,619
whatever you bought on Shakedown Street

2342
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,899
and got friends probably still from

2343
01:33:19,619 --> 01:33:24,000
those days I I didn't I never was a

2344
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:26,039
deadhead you know I I like their music

2345
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,619
but I never went and saw them tour and I

2346
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:31,019
I hate that I missed that but you know

2347
01:33:28,619 --> 01:33:34,859
it seems like with Jerry gone and that

2348
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:38,760
we all know that that that movement that

2349
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:41,698
served a function of of propagating and

2350
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,739
preserving genetics you know people

2351
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:45,479
brought their best to the show because

2352
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:48,479
they wanted to show off to their friends

2353
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:50,339
and you know I mean it wasn't just to

2354
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:52,559
make money to get to the next show or

2355
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:56,039
whatever it was you know there was Pride

2356
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:58,679
associated with that and competition

2357
01:33:56,039 --> 01:34:00,359
um when those when those events stopped

2358
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:03,480
you know I guess I guess the internet

2359
01:34:00,359 --> 01:34:05,939
kind of took its place it did I agree

2360
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:08,279
that's a great Point yeah and and you

2361
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:10,678
know and it took it to places like Way

2362
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:12,599
Beyond we could have ever gotten to in

2363
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:15,539
those parking lots and cell phone

2364
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:18,179
numbers or you know what however the old

2365
01:34:15,539 --> 01:34:20,819
connections were maintained yeah pay

2366
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:23,399
phones and beepers you know this this

2367
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:25,559
summer will be 25 years uh that I've

2368
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:27,539
lived in Mendocino County and I

2369
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:30,239
absolutely would not live here if Dad

2370
01:34:27,539 --> 01:34:32,399
had friends that I knew from from shows

2371
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:36,059
and tour had not lived here and invited

2372
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:37,979
me out yeah 100 so I mean this you know

2373
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:43,320
the health the health of the community

2374
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:46,079
as it exists today is because of forms

2375
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:48,059
um you know and and I I like to

2376
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,880
differentiate between community and

2377
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:52,620
Industry you know the community is all

2378
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:55,020
the people that kept this stuff alive

2379
01:34:52,619 --> 01:34:57,119
when it was illegal everywhere and and

2380
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:59,760
and getting caught could be the end of

2381
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:02,279
you know ruin your life literally

2382
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:05,579
um you know all those people who who did

2383
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:08,939
the work when when the when the

2384
01:35:05,579 --> 01:35:11,399
the consequences were so grave you know

2385
01:35:08,939 --> 01:35:13,559
those people are part of the community

2386
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:16,019
and the industry I think we all know

2387
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:19,560
what the industry is you know it's it's

2388
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:22,139
it's the big business that that hopes to

2389
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,060
get rich off the back of of that Legacy

2390
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:26,819
and you know I'm not I got nothing

2391
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:30,239
against big business but um

2392
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:32,819
you know it's it's a if it seems that

2393
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,799
the two the community and and the type

2394
01:35:32,819 --> 01:35:38,759
of things that the community has has

2395
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:40,860
worked towards and values is is it a

2396
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,659
collision course or in direct conflict

2397
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:44,939
with the industry

2398
01:35:42,658 --> 01:35:48,238
right that the the industry is all about

2399
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:50,519
money and that that drives you know

2400
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:53,459
um production practices way you know way

2401
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:55,320
down in a negative way for Quality

2402
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:57,239
um standardization everything turns

2403
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:59,698
everything homogenization right

2404
01:35:57,238 --> 01:36:03,299
everything is the same you get the same

2405
01:35:59,698 --> 01:36:04,979
mediocre crap everywhere you go and

2406
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,500
um you know that's

2407
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:09,899
I don't know so I'm I'm all about the

2408
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:11,579
community versus industry and and the

2409
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:13,979
communities wouldn't be here without the

2410
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:15,960
internet so that's a great Point art art

2411
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:19,319
and economics have always been

2412
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:21,359
uncomfortable bed fellows right yeah

2413
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:23,099
nice is that a quote or did you just

2414
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,960
make off the top of your head I just

2415
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,579
it's definitely not me but I just spun

2416
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,819
it off the top of my head you know yeah

2417
01:36:26,579 --> 01:36:30,960

2423
01:36:44,658 --> 01:36:50,339
I shaved my beard off a few episodes ago

2424
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,619
because you're right it it makes you
