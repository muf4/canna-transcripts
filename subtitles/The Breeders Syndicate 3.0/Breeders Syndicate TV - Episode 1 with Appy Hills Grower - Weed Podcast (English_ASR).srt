85
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,958
don't know if you are happy but I'm not

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,719
a professional so take everything we say

87
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,000
with the grain of salt this is more just

88
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,158
kind of you know to hang out and

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,799
something a little bit less serious than

90
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,560
Matt's uh show on Fridays and uh well

91
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,879
let's go ahead and take it uh maybe we

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,560
could start at the beginning with you

93
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,679
appy and uh maybe talk about your first

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
uh the first time you heard about weed

95
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,438
or the first time you smoked or maybe

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,280
your first interaction with it and you

97
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:16,918
know as far as back as you can

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,918
remember first interactions was always

99
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,719
family because whenever family got

100
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,319
together they'd go sneak off and when

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,600
you're 10 years old trying to figure out

102
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,079
why everybody's coming back into the

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,000
house happy and

104
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,079
hungry and you know my dad wasn't the

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,038
most Pleasant son of a gun sometimes s

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,839
and that family get togethers he and I

107
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,879
are tp's in a pod but when you get him

108
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,478
coming in happy and hungry like oh [ __ ]

109
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,159
what's up with that so the smell that's

110
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,758
where I smelled it first was the family

111
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,400
G togethers uh first experience with it

112
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,520
was probably 15 years old with

113
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,799
friends uh of course all brick I mean my

114
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,439
experience I we didn't get good stuff

115
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,759
out here till

116
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,879
probably right when I start right when I

117
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,319
graduated high school in 92

118
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,839
was when we started seeing better stuff

119
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,719
because other than that I mean dude we

120
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,599
didn't even get the Christmas Bud like

121
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,520
when it would come in green M all we got

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,439
was the brown brick it either smelled

123
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:20,120
like diesel fuel or r or something and I

124
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,038
mean heck you would buy a quarter hoping

125
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,519
for a [ __ ] joint out of it because by

126
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,240
the time you got the stems and seeds out

127
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,120
that's what about what you

128
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,600
had I can relate because I mean growing

129
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,879
up Kentucky uh you know not super super

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,639
far off from where you were probably uh

131
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,439
that's the same thing my experience was

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,879
all brick weed dude just press brown

133
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,319
brick weed for years uh probably from I

134
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,360
think I didn't really start buying weed

135
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,439
until

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,520
probably 17 or 18 but that's because I

137
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,120
was around older people that smoked uh a

138
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,079
bunch uh M mainly Reggie and I didn't

139
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
really need to pay for it because when

140
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,560
we growing up we would all just stay at

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,478
each other's houses all the time s you

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,519
know sit I mean [ __ ] as long as I can

143
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,879
remember staying over my buddy's houses

144
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,359
so and I was real poor dude so all my

145
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,598
buddies I couldn't have bought weed

146
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,598
until I had a job anyways really so um

147
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,959
so but yeah most of the weed for the

148
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:21,399
first you know four or five years of me

149
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,359
smoking uh was Reggie brick [ __ ] weed

150
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,799
press stuff but then we started seeing

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,319
more like kind of light green stuff that

152
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,160
didn't have as much as many seeds in it

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,759
and uh that's right and we had that for

154
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,840
about a year or two and then uh then we

155
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,400
started getting this stuff called $10 bu

156
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,959
or 10 a gram or 15 a gram 20 a gram and

157
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,598
then as we a few years into that we

158
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,239
finally started getting some good [ __ ]

159
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,000
but um when you said you said your dad

160
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
and and your family and them smoked did

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,120
you ever was your first time smoking uh

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,079
smoking a leftover joint or something

163
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,639
like that or was it actually just oh no

164
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,719
they were way too secretive I mean dude

165
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,918
they were way too worried about covering

166
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,759
their tracks and they're damn good at it

167
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,159
cuz none of them stunk horrifically when

168
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,080
they came back in the house cuz I think

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,520
my grandfather had to put a kabach for

170
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:16,639
that [ __ ] real quick beat their ass but

171
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:19,839
oh God no my uncles were huge and my

172
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,680
grandfather was not a big guy but my

173
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,799
idol but anyway it it

174
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,800
it I always got mine from buddies

175
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,560
because I grew up rougher than a cob and

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,918
with some of my friends yeah we were

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
always the outcast pick on group you

178
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,000
know

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,439
thees and that's why I gravitated I

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,319
think more towards cannabis than I did

181
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,839
anything else because I mean when you

182
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,120

279
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
probably stopped me from having a kid is

280
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,278
just is uh growing I wouldn't say my

281
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
parents were were bad parents they were

282
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,639
great parents but just when it comes to

283
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
financial decisions in life they didn't

284
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,639
weren't the best about it uh the

285
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,480
decisions they made and they had kids

286
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,639
when they were young so stuff was you

287

stand just druin on yourself man come on

345
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320

346
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,799
can't even lend him $10 dude cuz you

347
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,519

348
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,479
I'm out by getting him a cheeseburger or

349
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,278
whatever he he'll go off and use that

350
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
for something he don't need to get into

351
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,399
but yeah not to take it into a dark tone

352
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,638
but yeah that's I think everybody's

353
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,320
affected by uh these types of things

354
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,519
nowadays I think everybody family family

355
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,839
me member or a friend that's going

356
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,399
through this kind of [ __ ] so I think

357
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,160
it's it's kind of important to talk

358
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,759
about but uh yeah and then everybody

359
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,838
needs to remember that if there's

360
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,320
somebody in treatment man give them

361
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,519
their prompts even if they're struggling

362
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,079
still give them their prompts because

363
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,480
they're they're trying to make a change

364
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,919
yeah I mean dude it's it's rough man and

365
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,519
I hope anybody that's going through that

366
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,599

374
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,680

better but uh but yeah U maybe back

376
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,399
we'll steer back towards marijuana here

377
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,278
but uh uh maybe uh so as you you're

378
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,679
smoking with your friends and stuff like

379
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,600
that uh maybe did you guys ever attempt

380
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,479
to grow or or what point did you decide

381
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,879
hey I want to try to grow some of this

382
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,319
[ __ ] so we lived I grew up in the

383
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:50,559
suburbs and we had a huge Community

384
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:53,639
Center behind us it was like 15 soccer

385
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:57,439
fields behind us in Harris

386
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,639
Ohio and behind it was a bunch of wood

387
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
so we tried growing in the woods but we

388
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,039
were so damn deep into the woods and I

389
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,039
mean dude I think we were

390
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,399
14 and you know we had found some seeds

391
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,480
in a bag of I think one of my buddies

392
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,879
brother you know you know his his older

393
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,600
brother's stuff right and that's where

394
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,439
we got most of our stuff from was his

395
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,560
older brother in the very beginning but

396
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,720
yeah I mean we put it in the ground I

397
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,758
don't think any of them ever sprouted

398
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,000
and then after the tornado came through

399
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,039
Harrison and that's a neat fact we we

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,198
were the first ever episode of Rescue

401
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,039
911 but back to

402
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,838
weed the we moved out into the middle of

403
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,958
nowhere and Harrison I mean it's it's

404
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,759
country out there I love it but it's in

405
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,359
the woods so there's no Farmland so all

406
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,680
you got to do is go find the biggest

407
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,720
tree that just fell down and I mean

408
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:54,399
we've got some scraggly stuff nothing

409
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,399
nothing like I'm getting the

410
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,920

411
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
brick and I don't what anybody says

412
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,958

[ __ ] myar stuff they got today and

415
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,480

416
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,120
that you can find is still decent right

417
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,599

418

419
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,599

420
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,279
weed and it didn't look good but damn

421

422
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,918

424
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,520

425
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,720
was that

426
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:37,759
thick main was that thick you smoke a

427
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,120

428
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,960

429
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,639
miss uh miss that but I I do know what

430
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,759
you're saying there is that uh those

431
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,679
myar bags nowadays that are [ __ ]

432
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,279
track and I've seen some you can get

433
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,798
some [ __ ] at some of these uh

434
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,158
dispensaries that's like the cheapest

435
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,359
[ __ ] they got it's like $20 ounces $30

436
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,000
ounces it looks damn near like that [ __ ]

437
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,399
just without seeds dude you know all

438
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,720
oxidized and [ __ ] dark looking [ __ ]

439
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,240
but uh well not only that but it's just

440
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,919
okay I'll ask you your opinion because

441
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,558
you do go to a lot of dispensaries and

442
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,720
I've had to here also and between grows

443
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:18,918
and different [ __ ] like that oh yeah

444
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,640
everything

445
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:25,799
smells like nothing like packing peanuts

446
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,720
almost like like there's no smell to it

447
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,679
it smells like the inside of the myar

448
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,759
bag and I don't know if just from The

449
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,360
Cure or the strain selections because

450
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,879
they're trying to flip them at six weeks

451
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,918
every strain they get a hold of because

452
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,799
it's money well it's probably a

453
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,159
combination of multiple factors right

454
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,798
you're probably pull they're probably

455
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,440
pulling early just because of the

456
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,359
industry and how it works they're

457
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,000
probably probably uh you know pumping

458
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,599
them full of nutrients to they're

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,359
probably cure is probably quick or or or

460
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,319
not slow enough or whatever uh and also

461
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,279
are they spraying for stuff like there's

462
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,038
so many things that could go into that

463
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,639
uh now I will say like I've made it a my

464
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,000
mission to explore all the [ __ ]

465
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,280
dispensaries that I can find in my

466
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,798
general area which is you know upwards

467
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:18,399
to like 20 plus in in my in the city

468
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,440
that's probably uh you know 15 minutes

469
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,280
away or so I'm in the country myself so

470
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,279
I have I do have to driving into town

471
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,639
but over the last year I've made a an

472
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,960
effort to go check everything out and I

473
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,720
you know I've made multiple purchases at

474
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,600
of them to make sure I get a good uh

475
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,240
idea of what they offer I mean when

476
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,279
you're talking about M what you were

477
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,079
talking about specifically earlier they

478
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:43,000
all offer that prepackaged Mage [ __ ] you

479
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,158
know real colorful packaging uh usually

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,798
sold in E you know they're trying to get

481
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,559
the attention with that yeah I agree

498
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,798
like 10:30 or 11 o'clock in the morning

499
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,640

500
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,440
or 10 so it's all out of state people

501
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,840
and this is during the summer so I mean

502
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,840
during the summer they're crushing it

503
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,678
because you got out of people out of

504
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,839
town people coming to boat to fish I

505
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,038
mean Michigan is a great place for that

506
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,359
kind you know to to finish up my point

507
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,558
about the dispensaries uh I will say

508
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,240
this you are going to find a lot of that

509
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:52,759
uh stuff you know uh I call it soulless

510
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,839
weed you know a lot of it's U machine

511
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:58,079
trimmed uh a lot of it is early pulled

512
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,359
early stuff like that but I will say

513
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,678
that often you can find at least one or

514
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,599
two things in that store that even a

515
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,679
seasoned person you might not walk away

516
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,399
extremely satisfied or blown away but I

517
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,200
have tested this out with people that

518
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,159
that I mean some of the guys in the

519
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
Discord even I've when I've met up with

520
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,400
them in person at parties I'll I'll slip

521
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,159
some of the [ __ ] into some of the smoke

522
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,159
and not many people can tell the

523
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,440
difference if you if you got the right

524
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,000
right thing or the right uh yeah the

525
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,798
right uh trrain or cultivar whatever but

526
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,640
I will say uh lately I've I've kind of

527
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,879
like tried to go to the more expensive

528
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,559
places uh people that are more I

529
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,278
wouldn't say it's not fully integrated

530
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,599
because they have separate Lo locations

531
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:43,679
but they grow their own stuff along with

532
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,480
other stuff uh local people local

533
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,960
farmers plus they have the prepackage

534
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,919
stuff now I will say like on that stuff

535
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,880
yeah it is worth an extra $10 on the

536
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,759
ounce to buy buy that if you are gonna

537
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,278
buy anything I will say that a lot of

538
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,879
that in there in a couple of these

539
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:00,640
stores and I won't name them but that it

540
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,440
was pretty good smoke dude is it better

541
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,278
than yeah what I grow or what my buddies

542
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,640
grow or is would I prefer that hell no

543
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:11,278
but uh you know if I was coming here out

544
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,880
of state for a day or two I would be

545
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:15,359
pretty satisfied with the overall

546
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,039
experience now you're going into going

547
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:22,199
into these places looking for experience

548
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:23,480
on uh strains or or how to grow or any

549
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,600
kind of thing like that you're not going

550
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,839
to get that there I don't think for most

551
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,119
part but uh yeah uh what about your

552
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,439
experiences with with with with wreck I

553

556
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,159
that I've bought

557
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,679
in God I want to say four or five years

558
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:52,480
that I've ever actually been able to

559
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,200
smell is is always the the Jack or the

560
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,880
train wreck that's the only thing I've

561
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,200

your nose in this tent

568
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,480
dude I'm telling you what that like I

569
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,880
got to grow some amazing stuff in the

570
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,400
very beginning when I first came to the

571
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,360
Discord I was getting into CSI pretty

572
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,480
damn heavy and I mean there's so many

573
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,639
people here that grow Caleb stuff too

574
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,038
but my God the different smells that

575
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,278
came off of that it was

576
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,079
awesome yeah I mean I should excuse me I

577
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:35,079
should

578
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:37,480
say uh in the last year there's probably

579
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,278
only been two or three things that I

580
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,159
would ever think about potentially

581
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:45,440
growing or even really wanting to smoke

582
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,039
again one of them I had recently was the

583
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,919
I can't ever say it right bro because I

584
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,960
got like a third grade reading level

585
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:55,080
what's the uh do doce de UA or whatever

586
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,600
I can't say it yeah that that was

587
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,158
actually decent I've seen some of the

588
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,399
guys in the Discord out in Cali talk

589
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,679
about that too if it's the same cut it's

590
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,159
it it's pretty decent for what it is but

591
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,440
like you were saying bro it's nothing

592
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:12,278
compared to you know a good H&amp;L uh pack

593
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,840
of seeds that I pop of whatever you know

594
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,679
it doesn't even compare especially when

595
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,879
you're talking about if you've cured it

596
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,440
right it was a good grow if everything

597
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,679
went perfect which I know it's hard to

598
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,798
do when you're growing but but uh yeah I

599
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,519
you know we'd ra I'd rather grow Homer

600
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:31,200
smoke homegrown all day if I can you

601
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,158
know but um so at what point did you uh

602
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,440
get a little bit more serious about

603
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,960
growing I guess or or maybe start buying

604
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
genetics because you said you were

605
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,360
getting stuff out of bags uh your you

606
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,278
know little bags and stuff you all were

607
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,639
smoking bag seed what once once I knew

608
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:49,919
that I wasn't G to get in trouble with

609
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,840
the kids because I dude I mean I

610
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,679
had the Rob Clark's indoor grow Bible

611
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,839
that was the first book I ever bought

612
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,798
and this just before I mean I just

613
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:03,720
wanted I just

614
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:07,440
wanted really or was that Rob

615
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,759
Clark is it this one sorry yeah sorry

616
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,798
named the wrong one but then I bought

617
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,119
the other one with the Two Fellas that

618
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:15,558
wrote it the indoor grow bible the white

619
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,678

620
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:22,918
letters I had book and then that one um

621
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,559
H Ed Rosen Falls okay so I bought those

622
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,559

623
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,639
hill in

624
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,440
Cincinnati that place on me made me

625
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,919
laugh cuz you couldn't say bong those

626
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,000
people would lose their goddamn mind if

627
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:36,320
you said bong like come on man but I got

628
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,919
it they can get in trouble but so I

629
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,319
started reading and I I am one of those

630
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,919
people that loves I am ADD like a son of

631
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:47,359
a gun so I I want to make a t-shirt with

632
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,320
a chrome squirrel on it that says on the

633
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,038
back of it o shiny and on the bottom of

634
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:55,639
the shirt says

635
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:58,519
squirrel but but marijuana itself is

636
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,919
always always had a place in my heart

637
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,558
I'm always trying to learn about it

638
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,640
and where I really started getting into

639
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,759
it honestly was the podcast the first

640
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,720
couple episodes when Duke got on there

641
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,519
and you know was talking it up and then

642
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,600
skunk was the second one Matt was on

643
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:20,158
right after that and I [ __ ] I I

644
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,079
chased his ass down I mean that's when I

645
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,399
started really listening to Instagram

646
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:28,599
and everything else with Matt and you

647
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:30,479
know religiously watching his lives on

648
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,639
Instagram but I didn't know how much the

649
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,599
patreon would cost and I was draft as

650
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,799
hell back

651
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,839
then and you know just anything I could

652
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,519
find that was giving me information and

653
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,918
knowledge and all the guys would give

654
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:48,918
you places to go

655
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:52,320
look so you know I've been at it in the

656
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,159
shed probably four or five years

657
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,038
now and I mean it's just it's not the

658
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,600
fact that I think I'm doing all that

659
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,200
great it's just I'm taking and the

660
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,519
knowledge that I'm learning from these

661
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,240

about to pull my bottle out but I I got

731
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,239
a couple bottles uh hanging up here

732
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,798
somewhere I was you're talking about

733
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,480
thrips man uh you know I've also been

734
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,599
[ __ ] around since I was like 14 15 16

735
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,240
growing bag seeds I like to I don't even

736
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,759
consider myself uh a grower back then

737
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,919
because I never even really would get to

738
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,558
harvest a lot of times I was I was

739
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,919
growing in my mom's house I was hidden

740
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:10,200
mind you in a [ __ ] closet uh I was

741
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,559
growing in uh rental property so I would

742
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,240
get to certain points where I'm about to

743
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:16,798
flower and of course I'm learning at the

744
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,599
time too back then I was on uh 420 Chan

745
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,200
that's what just at the time that's what

746
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,038
I was using to learn and I watched a lot

747
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,240
of the hor Jorge svantes grow videos I

748
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:29,519
would download them off like lime wire

749
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:33,000
and [ __ ] Bro Pirate Bay and uh and 420

750
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:37,079
CH that's how I was learning and uh uh

751
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,200
but uh back to my point uh I over these

752
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,678
last probably about a year and a half

753
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
maybe two years before Co hit um I

754
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,720
started [ __ ] around with growing I

755
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,359
wouldn't say serious but I had a tent

756
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,880
right and uh over these last few years

757
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:56,719
I've been doing it Non-Stop and some of

758
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,360
the uh I've never really had some of the

759
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,319
issues that a lot of the guys have gone

760
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,558
through with thrips mites [ __ ] like that

761
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,558
I just got lucky I had a few spider

762
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,960
mites with one of my first grows because

763
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,359
I was taking stuff in and out like a

764
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,480
dumbass yeah yeah yeah but but this

765
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,519
summer moving up to Michigan it's a

766
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,440
totally different environment dude it's

767
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,159
it's it's a lot more challenging to grow

768
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,639
I would say for me inside and out uh

769
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,760
humidity is a little different humidity

770
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:28,479
in mold uh so out last year last summer

771
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,319
last season uh

772
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,960
I did some of H&amp;L stuff outside and uh

773
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,439
didn't have really I saw a few spider

774
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,399
mites here there nothing crazy and then

775
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,759
uh I also had never seen a thrip before

776
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:46,278
bro so I bring everything in back in

777
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,200
October uh and harvest everything and

778
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:49,839
you know I tried to clean all the leaves

779
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,120
out and stuff off as much as I could

780
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,359
outside before I brought them in I I

781
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,678
kind of would do showers like you were

782
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,839
saying I especially if I'm going in the

783
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,960
grow room I definitely would change

784
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,918
clothes maybe not shower all the time

785
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,000
but anyways month month or two after

786
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,639
outdoor Harvest I brought everything in

787
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,038
I've had everything in for about a month

788
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:10,398

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,880

793
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,319

794

because now moving forward uh I a't I

851

don't have an issue to worry about

852

thrips I'm sure you can agree you get

853
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,879
you know how to handle it you know what

854
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,359

yeah yeah and the snail Trails is the

857
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,638
instant giveaway yeah if you've got many

858
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,240
snail Trails on your leaves you got

859
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,878
Thrift F and simple yeah you could see

860
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,319
them too at least the ones I uh the on

861
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,199
yeah if you flip over the seed or flip

862
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,920
over the if you flip over the leaf and

863
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,559
they're normally on the bigger fan

864
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
leaves that's where they go first

865
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,920
because there's there's more for them to

866
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,838
eat yeah and you'll see the really tiny

867
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,519
little white flexs and then when they

868
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,920
get older they turn to black and then

869
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,800
they start flying yep yeah and I think

870
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,800
too what um I think where what got me

871
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,240
[ __ ] up is I've seen a couple flying

872
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,119
originally bro and I and I wanted to say

873
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,439
I just thought they were gnats bro I

874
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,838
didn't really pay much attention I

875
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,320
thought they were fungus snats cause but

876
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,119
if you get to looking at them they look

877
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,800
totally different they almost got like a

878
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,079
the ones I had were almost had a reddish

879
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,200
Hue to them uh kind of looking things

880
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,800
once they flying they don't fly very

881
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,838
good they yeah they don't stay up very

882
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,039
long and they're yeah like you said

883
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,078
they're completely different color where

884
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,320
the fungus knots are a little darker

885
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,599
yeah almost black yeah that's the thing

886
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,318
is when I I realized that they're

887
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,039
terrible Flyers so uh I just increased

888

00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,480
and I'm thinking man this is some

925
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,199
redneck [ __ ] dude right here I said I

926
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,400
wonder if this is work and I and I some

927
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,078
of the plants I had it uh bro they were

928
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,720
like on their last little leg there was

929
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,880
a couple that were ate up and bro and

930
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:33,799
I'm not recommending this to anybody but

931
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,200
for me I sprayed them dude and sure

932
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,519
enough the next day not even eight hours

933
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,480
later bro I come I look in that tent

934
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,159
took all the mold out bro of course now

935
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,440
I got this [ __ ] dried milk on

936
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:49,118
everything right took all the mold out

937
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:52,000
and the the new growth the new growth is

938
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,000
is coming through they greened up it's

939
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,199
weird dude it kind of surprised me now I

940
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
don't know if that's going to affect

941
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:01,199
when I go to dip uh and sulfur if I need

942
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,639
to or not I don't know I you know and I

943
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,039
need to talk to a couple guys bitter

944
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,838
gave me the uh recommendation of using

945
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:11,159
sulfur because that takes care of molds

946
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,078
that takes a mil you know mil or PM uh

947
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:16,559
you know mites rust itss or whatever and

948
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,200
a few other things so U if I can't get

949
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,519
it with the milk I'm hoping the [ __ ]

950
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:23,000
sulfur takes care of it if not I'm gonna

951
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,400
cut them all down and start start over I

952
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,039
guess I don't know but well that's the

953
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,920
beautiful thing about it too if you

954
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,920
really think about it just from the damn

955

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,559
what you pay for I can I can attest to

961
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,838
this I'm a damn

962
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,119
nobody and I'm getting some of the

963
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:56,759
greatest damn seeds to

964
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,119
GP well maybe people don't might might

965
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,920
not know what it it is so uh so in the

966
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:05,519
breeder Syndicate uh Discord we actually

967
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,760
uh have tier systems and you could join

968
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,400
for five bucks uh that just get you the

969
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,560
discount on everything on Riot seeds.com

970
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,960
uh or not everything but most of the

971
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,440
stuff on there specifically uh Matt Matt

972
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,639
gear and a few of other guys and then uh

973
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,880
there's a 15 Tier and then there's a 50

974
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,759
tier $50 tier which uh a lot there's

975
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,119
confusion on this I wanted to say this

976
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,880
here so people understand um

977
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,039
it's you get a a pack per month at that

978
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,920
$50 tier but sometimes Matt will do it

979
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,119
you know once there's two to three or

980
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,039
four built up so it saves on shipping

981
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,519
stuff quarterly is what he's trying to

982
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:45,480
shoot for is every every four months he

983
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:47,960
tries to shoot one out and and I mean

984
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,039
dude if you grow what the hell you just

985
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,559
got from him in that patreon package

986
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:56,000

987
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:59,000
be ready for the next patreon package

988

989
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,838
genetics got in there right

992
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,599
bong toes for

993
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:18,159

queen and the haspl time space

996
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,079
queen awesome dude and and the good

997
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,880
thing about this one is is I was

998
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:33,359
actually able to get the blueberry it's

999
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,160
just due in the uh vegetative state

1000
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:38,159
because of where I had to flip so quick

1001
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:41,759
the last time to get in on the

1002
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:45,039
contest yeah man um speaking of the

1003
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,880
blueberry dude uh those things are the

1004
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,000
they're more Squat and chunky so I

1005
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,480
understand what you're talking about

1006
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,719
vegetative growth and in my run dude I

1007
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,358
enjoyed all I did four of them uh the

1008
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:58,039
rest are males I enjoyed that the

1009
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:02,239
blueberry so much man the turs were spot

1010
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,800
on blueberry um and dude I actually and

1011
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,519
like you dude I don't feel like I did it

1012
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,240
justice cuz I actually took the mail and

1013
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,400
hit it to them so I can get some more

1014
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,078
seed and uh I'm a cheap bastard dude I'm

1015
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,800
chucking everything I got I want more

1016
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,359
seeds dude but uh so I I made more of it

1017
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,440
so I could kind of do my own uh run and

1018
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:24,000
my own little little hunts I guess if

1019
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,639
you call them but uh yeah I also feel I

1020
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,679
want to rengge mine out or even do one

1021
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:30,480
outside dude I think that would be fun

1022
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,719
to do outside but I love the

1023
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,639
apprehensive of growing anything outside

1024
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:38,039
around here because of our damn humidity

1025
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:41,598
it I mean once it hits October we get so

1026
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:45,079
funky here that I mean I'd almost have

1027
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,039
to dig out a a six inch deep freaking

1028
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,160
platform and put sand in it but then I

1029
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,318
gotta worry about Dr and everything else

1030
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:56,399
put a greenhouse over top of it to keep

1031
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:59,079
humidity down I mean yeah that's how we

1032
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,079
used to do it at the when I was growing

1033
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,720
at a farm that I used to work at we'd

1034
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,280
grow winter plants on float beds but you

1035
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,679
had to have sand in the middle of the

1036
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:13,200
aisle to help take the moisture off of

1037
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:16,480
the greenhouse right yeah uh that's a

1038
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:18,239
thing I had uh last season up here uh I

1039
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,199
just was a little hesitant about growing

1040
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,000
stuff because it was my first season so

1041
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,159
and I didn't know what to expect so what

1042
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,960
I I just said hey I'm gonna put stuff in

1043
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:29,519
the ground here I'm not gonna add any

1044
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,159
soil I'm not gonna add anything I'm just

1045
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,880
gonna see what it does on its own just

1046
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:36,239
to get a base

1047
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,200
idea and uh dude I put some hypy stuff

1048
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,239
out I put some uh some some stuff from

1049
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,679
the Discord a lot most stuff that I put

1050
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:48,719
out was from HL the rank strangers which

1051
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:50,799
you know those are a haze uh uh a mango

1052
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:55,399
Haze cross that's the kimd times the

1053
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,680
mango Haze and dude I I didn't think it

1054
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,200
was going to finish but it ended up

1055
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:01,558
finishing up here and it was the least

1056
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,318
moldiest plant I had I don't think I

1057
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,280
really had any mold maybe like a nug or

1058
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:09,519
two but dude anything that was purple

1059
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:13,960
for some reason just [ __ ] molded the

1060
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:17,639
[ __ ] out bro I mean bad like really bad

1061
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,760
yeah yeah um but that being said uh I

1062
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:23,558
had uh what was it the dog walker snacks

1063
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,960
from konzo I think that's and I'm sorry

1064
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,200
if I'm getting that wrong I think it's I

1065
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,400
can't keep track of all these names and

1066
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,000
[ __ ] but I think it's the dog Walker

1067
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,119
snacks that was a little bit more dense

1068
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,440
uh but it that came out uh it wasn't

1069
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,960
purple but it did come out uh didn't

1070
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,280
didn't have much mold on it like that

1071
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,358
you know but uh yeah man uh growing

1072
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,079
outside is [ __ ] it it was a new

1073
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,558
experience and probably the most fun I

1074
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,079
had I went in into it thinking like man

1075
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,519
none of this is probably gonna work out

1076
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,839
because a lot of the guys are like oh

1077
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,039
dude you're gonna get mold [ __ ] like

1078
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:54,599
that sure enough I got some but it was

1079
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,400
fun bro there's something about going

1080
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,160
outside

1081
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,240
it's not been the fact I mean yeah

1082
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:02,598
granted they're telling you it's going

1083
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,679
to mold but [ __ ] you're learning you're

1084
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,880
not trying to freaking Harvest a bunch

1085
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,558

1093
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:30,358

not when you're done and you harvest

1145
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,000
that that is something I think you could

1146
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,159
keep in the jar for 15 damn years and

1147
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,920

00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:43,519
beginners that you that you've grown

1277
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,519
yourself I guess I should

1278
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:51,199
say girls best friend because you're

1279
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,240
gonna bring in it's still hype

1280
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,879
enough because you've got the warm

1281
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,849
cookies times 1091 so it's going to

1282
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,640
introduce them to

1283
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:02,199
[Music]

1284
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:05,798
Kem because the chem's dominant in that

1285
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:10,838
one and it grows unbelievably

1286
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:12,199
inside just it put or any of any of the

1287
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:15,599
bub

1288
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:17,639
acrosses but out you know and then you

1289
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,798
know because I wouldn't suggest train

1290
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,759
rest because you're gonna freak out when

1291
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:23,519
it starts

1292
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:26,680
flopping but after you get a gr or two

1293
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,210
under belt I would Point anything high

1294
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:28,639
and

1295
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,440
[Music]

00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:35,279
lo put two in and only put

1297
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:38,400
one and and then of course any of ma

1298
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,400
stuff I mean that blueberry stuff is UN

1299
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,400
but that's another one you almost want

1300
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,079
to coup under your belt because you're

1301
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,960
GNA get so frustrated thinking

1302
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,400
hey for four weeks no you might have to

1303
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,798
six

1304
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,519
eight and then send it out on the bottom

1305
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:59,519
get it up to the top you know already it

1306

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,719
perfect yeah I uh I would have to

1309
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,760
agree on the blueberry and the train

1310
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:15,118
wreck really is blueberry is easy to

1311
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,359
grow but I feel like yeah I

1330
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,239
favorites to grow and dude it comes out

1331
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,440
pretty consistent that's another thing

1332
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:10,239
too you know uh just coming out really

1333
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,639
consistent but but uh another one you

1334
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:17,639

1336
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:24,719
Bubbas uh times the uh Kim D times uh

1337
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:28,078
Appalachia dude that one was another

1338
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,759
easy one it was Ron it's stacked nice

1339
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,359
all this stuff that I usually talk about

1340
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,960
is from seed I I do run clones of stuff

1341
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:36,318
I try to but man I'm usually going

1342
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,318
through so many plants that I usually

1343
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,838
just will and I like to run the seed

1344
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,719
plant or you know the the plant from

1345
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,279
seed first and then I'll take Cuts if I

1346
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,000
like it and then run you know that's

1347
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,000
just the way I do it some people like to

1348
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,639
take cuts for more stability and [ __ ]

1349
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,719
like that and that's fine I

1350
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:57,838
just on everything I see everything that

1351
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:03,399
I pop from seed I try to take

1352
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:08,358
just a redneck version of anic Road

1353
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:13,680
areic literally got how many on

1354
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:16,920
that and just a 27 gallon fre Co that

1355
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:21,759
I've got weather on the top of the lid

1356
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:25,400
and then you know I on four not four

1357
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,280
corners but the two on each side because

1358
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,760
the handle click

1359
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:34,920
but still got enough where when you run

1360
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,240
that pwn pump in with the emitters it'll

1361
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,400
out so you want to put little clamps on

1362
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:43,919
the side so it feel it against the the

1363
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,160
thing or against weather shipping but I

1364
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,240
try to run coins on everything that I do

1365
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:51,838
and then I'm done with it I'm it I'm not

1366
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:53,679
saying that the I'm not looking at Brea

1367
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,440
the only thing I ever want to try to do

1368
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,480
anything with is going to be the 500

1369
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,200
stuff because know there no more seeds

1370
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:05,798

maybe they come out [ __ ] maybe they

1416

01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:14,038
knowledgeable and have been growing for

1492
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,440
10 20 30 40 years it sometimes you're

1493
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:18,520
going to butt heads on different

1494
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:21,200
opinions and things you know uh and not

1495
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:23,480
to mention in life I mean right now

1496
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,118
everything's a little crazy so and

1497
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,199
depending on your stance on stuff so but

1498
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:30,358
but something I love about our community

1499
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:32,960
and and and what we're trying to do is

1500
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:35,960
just you know focus on the plants focus

1501
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,240
on you know learning focus on having a

1502
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,679
good time I mean if you're a person that

1503
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:43,000
gets your feelings hurt pretty easily or

1504
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:45,000
maybe uh maybe you're you're made out of

1505
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,079

1632
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:20,079
friend he he showed me how to do cold

1633
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,600
starts because back when I learned about

1634
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:23,318
dabs growing up these [ __ ]

1635
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,759
would torch this [ __ ] and I was like

1636
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:28,440
that's not me bro and uh recently my

1637
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,479
buddy he showed me how to do cold starts

1638
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:33,399

party bro and that dude that was

1643
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:48,079
[ __ ] it depends on your temperature so

1644
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:50,318
when you're doing cold you're kind

1645
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:53,719
of and

1646
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:58,319
what and I do

1647
01:08:53,719 --> 01:09:03,239
them is I'll put the booger on

1648
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:06,080

1681
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,279
out here we could go through through uh

1682
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:31,960
okay

1683
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:33,679
any um went through that one let's see

1684
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,719
okay you said you're not much into the

1685
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,239
breeding but um if you could have a

1686
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,158
dream strain if you could create your

1687
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:44,198
own strain um what which ones would you

1688
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,679
what two plants would you cross together

1689
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:48,639
or if you could have any cut maybe any

1690
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,920
kind of

1691
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,600
hypothetical I wish I wish my bubble gum

1692
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,960
cres would have

1693
01:10:53,600 --> 01:11:00,440
worked um I I I got pollen facts on my

1694
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,198
bubble gum reason I did that is what we

1695
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:05,919
talking about earlier the

1696
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:11,039
humidity and that's the one thing I mean

1697
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:14,920
I'm I'm gonna take everything Caleb said

1698
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:18,000
as and he says that bubble gun not

1699
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:22,000
outside and that's the only reason now I

1700
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:27,238
would cross train Rack

1701
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,238
or something that's going to the bubble

1702
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,560

leaves you can smell that blue dream bro

1794
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:36,238
and I know it because I I've grown uh

1795
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:38,719
dryer sheets in the previous uh Pock

1796
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,638
mystery grow uh like a year and a half

1797
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:45,480
ago or something like that U or year ago

1798
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:48,199
uh that was the most that particular

1799
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:50,559
cross I mean I remember drying in this

1800
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:52,158
tent I cleaned the tent out and then I

1801
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,360
did a whole another dry on a whole

1802
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,279
another run like three months later and

1803
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:59,198
that [ __ ] tent still smelled like

1804
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,880
that uh dryer sheets is the The Strain

1805
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,919
or the cross that it was uh but yeah

1806
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,760
dude just the Blue Dream Is Awesome from

1807
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,319
Pac dude I love it I I think he said he

1808
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,840
I don't I think the s1's are sold out

1809
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,439
right now on Matt site but I think he

1810
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:17,360
said he's working on getting some more

1811
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:20,519
up but I'm not sure but um yeah man uh

1812
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:21,920
if you had a dream grow setup what would

1813
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:26,120
you

1814
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:29,199
have uh a shed that was 10 by 20

1815
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:31,479
yeah umon I say that is because I would

1816
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:33,519
put at least

1817
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:37,359
byes because then I would have a

1818
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:41,320
dedicated 5 by nothing bed but then I

1819
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:44,479
would do two by fours on the side so you

1820
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:46,799
could do a mom room you could do a clone

1821
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:51,678
you could have your individual T

1822
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,679
so be because

1823
01:16:53,560 --> 01:17:03,480
don't so there's my gorilla there's

1824
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:08,360
my and then the the two by right there

1825
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:11,759
so I mean I keep everything in here

1826
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:11,759
regulated by

1827
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:19,280
dehumidified and that's the mistake a

1828
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:21,960
lot of people make is when you run your

1829
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:23,319
deidier don't let it go into the tread

1830
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,840
you're never going to keep up with that

1831
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:26,840
tread not

1832
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:34,880
no a

1833
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:34,880
sec good so just

1834
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,000
run the side of your

1835
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,840
thing it doesn't have to be I mean

1836
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,399
that's

1837
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:50,760
but you can you can not worry about it

1838
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:53,839
as much

1839
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:57,840
right here well hell you know all

1840
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:00,360
the we had a sh R the humidity is you

1841
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,239
can cut through it

1842
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:05,639
yep humidifier dumps into that 5 gallon

1843
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:08,759
bucket and there's no way that's Gonna

1844
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:12,880
Fill Up by the time I get home from work

1845
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:15,400
yeah [ __ ] dude uh I I'm I'm about to rig

1846
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:18,039
my my drain for my dehumidifier out the

1847
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:20,839
window bro I'm tired of [ __ ] even the

1848
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:23,840
five gallon bucket I'm tired of it it's

1849
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:25,440
it's that five gallon bucket of Ro or

1850
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,760
that five gallon

1851
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,678
of dehumidified water is no different

1852
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:33,159
than your water system you're trying to

1853
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:37,158
set up it's nothing in

1854
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:40,439
it yeah I thought I was I'm just so

1855
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:43,039
weary about about uh I got a cheaper

1856
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:44,799
dehumidifier bro and you know I could

1857
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,600
probably obviously you know check check

1858
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,600
what's in it and [ __ ] like that but I

1859
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,159
use that [ __ ] for outside like I'll take

1860
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:53,360
it out to like uh you know like plants

1861
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:55,839
outside or whatever and also we're we're

1862
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:57,000
on a whale too so it's like dude I just

1863
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,000
dump it on the ground it's going back

1864
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,079
into the [ __ ] [ __ ] well at some point

1865
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,520
you know well have to worry about C mag

1866
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:09,600
yeah well actually you do here bro it's

1867
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:12,400
kind of weird uh so here it's more iron

1868
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,120
and dissolved like Metals uh that are in

1869
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:17,519
the water so

1870
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:20,719
because yeah

1871
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:23,040
so right so back home bro I didn't

1872
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,198
realize how good I had it you know

1873
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,719
there's been some people that will [ __ ]

1874
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:28,599
on Kentucky about growing but the water

1875
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,198
and the temperature and everything for

1876
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,639
me even in the winter time was perfect

1877
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:36,919
never really got PM never really had

1878
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:38,920
pest problems nothing dude but here bro

1879
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:41,119
uh the water's different like there the

1880
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:43,119
water had tons of calcium and different

1881
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,880
different things in it and I knew it

1882
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,880
You' see it build up on your fish tanks

1883
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,440
and [ __ ] you know whereas here it's iron

1884
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,639
and different Metals you see it just

1885
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:54,158
building up and you could smell it and

1886
01:19:51,639 --> 01:19:56,039
so you know a lot of people say well

1887
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:59,719
just you know I'm running like two to

1888
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:01,960
300 ppms coming out the faucet so I I

1889
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:05,158
personally don't know what's in it uh I

1890
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:06,600
know obviously you get up to like 4 500

1891
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:08,399
you're you can go all the way up to like

1892
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,239
4 500 to the point where it's not safe

1893
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:13,279
to drink probably but hey I'm just I

1894
01:20:11,238 --> 01:20:16,279
want to start at a base level with the

1895
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:17,759
RO that way I can put in even it's I got

1896
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:19,880
to spend a little bit more money I don't

1897
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,440
mind because I know what's in it I know

1898
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:24,760
how you know exactly what my inputs are

1899
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:27,439
and uh that's kind of where I'm at if I

1900
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,960
had a dream grow setup I would probably

1901
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:32,799
have rooms but still like individual

1902
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:35,639
sealed rooms but still have tents but

1903
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:38,279
maybe bigger bigger rooms bigger tents

1904
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:41,239
but just individual sealed rooms because

1905
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:43,039
you know I I don't know I a big building

1906
01:20:41,238 --> 01:20:46,238
outside like a big [ __ ] Warehouse or

1907
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:48,158
a building would be great dude with a me

1908
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,519
with what I know I can afford eventually

1909
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:52,719
in a 10 by2 sh I grow up my damn self

1910

1911
01:20:52,719 --> 01:21:01,960
or honestly I might go crazy is put in 2

1912
01:20:56,679 --> 01:21:07,119
by1 building it once for me for my I put

1913

in 2 by 12s with spray and put pressure

1914
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,279
treated wood on the very bottom with a

1915
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:12,880
regular plywood on the top because then

1916
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:17,119
you don't have to worry

1917
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:19,920
about and then spray the

1918
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:24,119
Walls 2 by1 dude you're going to look at

1919
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,158
an R35 or an R40 dude it could be 20 Dam

1920
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:26,519
outside

1921
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:31,000
inside the damnn room and it's gonna

1922
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:33,719
warm it up y you know if I could have my

1923
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
next spot and I'll be moving not not

1924
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:39,198
I'll be moving here pretty soon uh my

1925
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,238
next spot I want to find uh a drain on

1926
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:44,359
the floor I want it to be concrete with

1927
01:21:41,238 --> 01:21:48,919
the drain on the floor I want a [ __ ]

1928
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:51,479
sink right there uh I want at least a

1929
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,920
few I got a few finally got a couple 55

1930
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,479
gallon reservoirs up here that I'm going

1931
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,158
to start I've just now I've been [ __ ]

1932
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:01,039
around with this RO system and I'm

1933
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:03,638
dialing it in I'm dialing it in but it's

1934
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:06,800
not where I want it to be just yet but I

1935
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:09,480
would have a big Reservoir or a few and

1936
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,239
uh yeah man more power bro that's

1937
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,519
another thing more power bro because you

1938
01:22:11,238 --> 01:22:17,759
could never have enough [ __ ] power I

1939
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:21,400
feel like dude you know and preferably a

1940
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,400
really nice uh some kind of well that

1941
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:25,679
would be good enough a sink and a drain

1942
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:29,079
and and a door bro I'm on the second

1943
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:32,639
floor so carrying soil and [ __ ] dude

1944
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:34,559
it's a [ __ ] it's fun

1945
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:39,039
bro there you

1946
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:43,000
go I don't have a shed door there you

1947
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:46,920
go my shed door is great stuff I mean I

1948
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:50,119
know that was a major problem so now I

1949
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,960
came across a freaking weather from my

1950
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:54,599
next my dad's next door neighbor for

1951
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,520
free

1952
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,039
I mean I just put it on the the shed and

1953
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,400
it has made all the difference in the

1954
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:04,960
world by airflow because you're never

1955
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:08,119
going to seal a shed door no but as you

1956
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,840
can see behind me that white is

1957
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:12,519
literally the stuff that you put under

1958
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,679
metaling on top of

1959
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:19,560
RC so you know I'm getting double

1960
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:21,880
insation great and I'm not paying too

1961
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:24,679
much I've got a window unit it's one of

1962
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:27,960
those sheds that had two windows on it

1963
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:29,279
AC and a small heater but as long as I

1964
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:33,960
run my

1965
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:38,000
life it stays pretty good yeah that's I

1966
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,000
mean dude redneck Ingenuity

1967
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:43,479
brother hopefully one of these days I

1968
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:45,158
can get a 3D printer and I mean I know

1969
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:47,039
I've talked it that nauseum on the

1970
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:51,238
Discord but I want to make my bucket

1971
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:54,439
system I mean you know and you know it

1972
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:56,919
blue mats meets redneck basically yeah

1973
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:59,719
yeah dude hey it's an individual blue

1974
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:03,000
mat it's something each buget has it own

1975
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:06,279
res it works literally [ __ ] away from

1976
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,198
this gr you know when I asked my miss

1977
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:11,119
when we went to Q I mean for four days

1978
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:15,599
and I didn't have to I didn't

1979
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:20,158
worry I right they just as smid heavier

1980
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:24,760
than I may normally do but soil not wet

1981
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:27,839
right added water resir below

1982
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,600
yeah man I uh we were maybe before I

1983
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,800
forget I we were talking about grow uh

1984
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,719
dream Grow rooms earlier

1985
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:38,440
um I there's a point where you get to

1986
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:42,118
where you got too many plants I mean I

1987
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:44,439
know you can always make it better and

1988
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:46,118
um more efficient but that's something I

1989
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:48,439
learned last year dude just like there's

1990
01:24:46,118 --> 01:24:51,839
a limit where it becomes not fun anymore

1991
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:53,439
at least for me U and maybe like maybe

1992
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,239
that would be too big if I could just

1993
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:58,079
have a nice little spot uh a room or to

1994
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:00,599
that has a sink and a drain that would

1995
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:03,479
be great but uh and enough power but

1996
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,400
yeah I mean dude I'm like you bro I I

1997
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:09,399
grew up poor as [ __ ] so anytime I could

1998
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:10,960
save a buck and if I got to put a a

1999
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:13,359
little bit of work and some elbow grease

2000
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,719
into something and to make it work uh

2001
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:17,880
I'm going to do it it's like those drums

2002

they were holding the brown rice syrup

2003
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:23,639

2004
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:26,519
each one and I got yeah and I mean a

2005

01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:08,000
clones do this that that so but's

2065
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,600
another when you see these you're gonna

2066
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,679
giggle because these have been mentioned

2067
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:16,560
100 goddamn times

2068
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:18,520
on every in a while even if you don't

2069
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:23,000
even have to see anything get your

2070
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:28,040
mosquit dunk put in the water water them

2071
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,039
in I going admit I

2072
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:36,760
am I'm the most generic General

2073
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:39,000
hydropic with I mean so M

2074
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:43,119
hydroponic

2075
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:47,279
recharge and that's Sil a

2076
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:49,158
supplement and I honest to God it is I

2077
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,439
know they talk about a bunch of that's

2078
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:54,960
non absorbent until eight years down the

2079
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:56,839
road that that is bioavailable because

2080
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,800
you get to the point where I know enough

2081
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:04,000
about plants and and growth structure

2082
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,520
just it's worth it because when you go

2083
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,319
from a stem that's that big around to a

2084
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:12,159
stem that's that damn big around it's

2085
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:14,039
like oh [ __ ] okay yeah well what was it

2086
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:15,279

2087
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:16,840

2088
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:19,439
something that yielded for you was it

2089
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:23,000
the blue dreams that was insane

2090

01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,039
remember being 15 16 17 years old

2110
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:23,759
thinking like watching some of these

2111
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:26,118
shows and and downloading some of these

2112
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,639
uh High Times cups and [ __ ] and yeah a

2113
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:30,960
lot of that [ __ ] was crooked or whatever

2114
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:33,039
but for me as a Kentucky kid like out on

2115
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,399
an island by myself with nobody to look

2116
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:38,479
up to really or talk to about marijuana

2117
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:40,118
or weed or whatever uh and not knowing

2118
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:41,399
you know I didn't you know when you when

2119
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:43,118
you're you don't know that everybody's

2120
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:45,399
[ __ ] out to get you or there's a lot

2121
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:49,000
of scammers and [ __ ] you just want to be

2122
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:51,960
a part of something I mean to be honest

2123
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,279
I mean I I I probably got $4,000 worth

2124
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:57,198
of sheets I'll never damn grow right

2125
01:30:55,279 --> 01:31:00,439
probably try to pop them I'll probably

2126
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:01,479
try to pop him but because I went on the

2127
01:31:00,439 --> 01:31:05,799
Dick

2128
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:08,279
Rider I mean it was whatever the old boy

2129
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:11,600
said that bets every grower you know

2130
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:13,719
getting too much prop or is to

2131
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,719
much of my genetics in the very

2132
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:17,880
beginning and then you start listening

2133
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:19,639
to Matt telling you the true stories and

2134
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:23,079
it wasn't the fact

2135
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:26,960
that I was trying to prove a point the

2136
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:30,840
reason I like M so much is he never

2137
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:33,600
Li yeah he never lies Matt out false

2138
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:35,400
information back in the day he instantly

2139
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,199
corrected himself and I'm not saying it

2140
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:42,679
happened a bunch but his pride never got

2141
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:45,399
in the way of true

2142
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:48,560
and always respected the hell out of

2143
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:50,799
that right you know we're going back to

2144
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:54,480
the what was it the third episode of the

2145
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:56,760
podcast I was on right I know it's

2146
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:59,678
pretty close for that I'll be honest I

2147
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:04,079
never really W I'll be honest I watched

2148
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:06,800
uh I watched a few uh panels with CSI

2149
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:09,118
years ago Dude on YouTube and I

2150
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,880
literally I think I

2151
01:32:09,118 --> 01:32:13,920
watched

2152
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:17,079
maybe one episode it was the episode of

2153
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,279
the origins of OG kush or something it

2154
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:22,600
was the one on what they were talking

2155
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:24,279
about from Florida or whatever and I

2156
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,600
just that was the one time watched

2157
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:29,559
something and then I literally saw Matt

2158
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:31,400
and NATO talking about some one of their

2159
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:33,320
podcasts and I just started watching

2160
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:34,839
that so I got real lucky and didn't I

2161
01:32:33,319 --> 01:32:38,198
mean don't get me wrong I brought my

2162
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:40,760

2163

and he we weren't super close but the

2247
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,399
times that he was around were were uh

2248
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:27,118
really important and meaningful to me

2249
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:28,679
and uh having D has been like having

2250
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:31,399
like almost like another almost like a

2251
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:34,000
dad or a grandpa he's been so good to me

me on keeps my stick on Ice keeps me on

2254
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:40,000
a straight and narrow path for a lot you

2255
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:42,319
know I get a little wild sometimes but

2256
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,399
uh you know and as far as the voice

2257
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:46,840
chats that we do after the show um yeah

2258
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:48,359
I mean dude I could be doing other [ __ ]

2259
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:51,360
but I I know that that means something

2260
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:54,000
to you guys and it's not about me it's

2261
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:56,559
just bringing uh some sometimes the

2262
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,840
community sometimes we need people to

2263
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,520
just be that first person to get

2264
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,679
something going and then you know other

2265
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,440
people join and we all have a good time

2266
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,679
because it is it's awkward getting on

2267
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:07,678
the Internet especially sharing uh some

2268
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:12,118
people are doing this uh still in the

2269
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:13,719
gray area of legality so I get how it's

2270
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:15,679
a little awkward but um yeah just

2271
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:17,319
getting on there and uh I don't know how

2272
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,480
many people want to listen to my dumbass

2273
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:21,599
talk but uh getting on there and having

2274
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:23,359
cutting up with you guys and um you know

2275
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,719
sharing stories and getting to know you

2276
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:28,238
guys guys uh uh believe it or not has

2277
01:37:25,719 --> 01:37:29,399
been one of the better uh and surprising

2278
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,238

going to say that uh you know you're the

2290

first person I talked to Matt about

2295
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:14,880
doing this one but my my thing I was

2296
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:16,279
going to say was you were the first

2297
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,760
person that came to my mind there's

2298
01:38:16,279 --> 01:38:19,198
there's tons of other people that are

2299
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,159
just deserving and stuff too it don't

2300

bring on as many people as we came from

2302

2303
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,440

growing the stuff uh you know it's not

2307
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:37,919
that you I don't think anybody should

have to grow stuff that they don't want

2309

2353
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:44,279
taken good care of me and I can't ex uh

2354
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:46,639
tell you how much I'm appreciative of

2355
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:48,118
them and uh you know and that's why I

2356
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,719
want to do the show to add value to

2357
01:40:48,118 --> 01:40:52,118
match Channel and and the breeder

2358
01:40:49,719 --> 01:40:55,359
Syndicate because you know I I think

2359
01:40:52,118 --> 01:40:56,598
this is this what we do in our Discord

2360
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:58,319
I'm not saying that other discords

2361
01:40:56,599 --> 01:41:00,800
aren't doing it right either or whatever

2362
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:03,000
but you know what we do and and focus on

2363
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:06,199
in our Discord it means the world to me

2364
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:09,079
so any way we can highlight that and put

2365
01:41:06,198 --> 01:41:10,799
that on on a a platform to where other

2366
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:13,559
people can see it and enjoy it and learn

2367
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,920
from it I mean it's a win-win dude and

2368
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:18,639

I have so much more in the discords

2427
