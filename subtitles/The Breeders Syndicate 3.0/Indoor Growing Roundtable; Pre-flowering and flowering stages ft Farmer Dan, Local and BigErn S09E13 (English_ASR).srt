maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,160
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,278
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,600
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,960
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,359
of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
cookies we are the traditional Market

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,238
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,358
has become much bigger than myself

23

he's had to record like three times in

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,520
the last week because we've been backed

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,840
up as well yeah so it's been been quite

46
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,640
the time but it's also been really good

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,118

flowering episode last time um and to

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,000
idea by Dan for everyone to just talk a

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,480
little bit about the setup they're

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,878
working with um in however much detail

58
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,518
that you guys want to um just so that

59
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:31,759
like we can set the scene a bit for the

60
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,760
flowering conversation

61
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,120
yeah I'll kick us off um right now for

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
my home setup like I do a few plants

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,640
outside every year but um for my indoor

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,360
I kind of just have a a little 4x4 tent

65
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,679
I have a little 1x4 veg which I should

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,200
have gotten bigger because I like to

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,680
keep a lot of plants um I have just like

68
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,439
a little AC unit like a window ducted

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,000
one that I uh cut a hole in the side of

70
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,400
it and just kind of mounted it there and

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,280
sealed it up and uh I rock a

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,200
spider 2p um LED and then in the veg

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,959
side just a few bar LEDs so really basic

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,479
kind of just enough to get it done and

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,479
hold on to

76
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,840

everybody so um but yeah so I have like

87
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:48,399
a more kind of like Perpetual kind of

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,959
setup um I have like a few you know

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,959
different like bar LEDs like I I I'm not

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,438
here to I wouldn't like necessarily plug

91
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,120
an LED super hard or anything um but in

92
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,719
my main flowering tent uh I I have like

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,120
a um Grover's Choice light in there and

94
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:10,799
I use some of the like UV bars with it

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,519
and I use like the AC Infinity stuff um

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,640
you know just to automate the

97
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,680
environmental

98
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,918
control yeah I forgot to mention that

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,439
too yeah I got the same AC Infinity

100
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,120
controller just because it's like so

101
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:24,279
modular like they have like plugs that

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,680
you can plug your AC unit into and like

103
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,159
your deums and kind of have a lot more

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,199
control than you normally would with a

105
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,840
homerow setup

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,199
yeah um

107
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:40,279
so I currently have a 5x5 flower space

108
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,120
with a

109
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:47,239
um it's think it's an 800 watt LED um I

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
don't know what it it like draws out the

111
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,918
wall but that that's what it's

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,520
advertised at um and

113
00:04:53,918 --> 00:05:00,439
I typically grow like one gallon pots

114
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,240
for flour um just a kind of see a number

115
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:06,319
of

116
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,400
things and like the homie said some AC

117
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,038
Infinity like uh 8 inch fans and stuff

118
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,719
like that

119
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:19,079
to remove air and then um I have some

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,720
veg closets throughout the house um but

121
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,839
yeah that's pretty

122
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,080
much my

123
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:30,519
girl do all of you perpetually flower

124
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:33,240
more or less yeah that's

125
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,758
kind of working on that now

126
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,759
yeah

127
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,960
cool yeah yeah so I try to um I you know

128
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,960
like I I like to run through things one

129
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,799
time and keep them backed up and then

130
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,519
you know rerun from there that kind of

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,800
thing so that's kind of my goal um in my

132
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,399
like kind of Perpetual thing is just

133
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,000
being able to look through stuff because

134
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:57,038
I am still very new um and just kind of

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,439
you know trying to figure out what I

136
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,719
like and that kind of stuff um

137
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:07,079
I'll also mention

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,880
um that um I do have like racks or a

139
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,800
rack in my veg space and that helps

140
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,598
utilize space but yeah same mine's

141
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,560
double here I just wanted to add that

142
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:20,478
just to kind of give a better picture I

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,038
guess I feel like it's mandatory if you

144
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,000
uh if you like really want to pop seeds

145
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:29,199
and keep backups and stuff like a 2x4

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,879
tent like fills up real quick right that

147
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,680
second tier really helps yeah there was

148
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,598
a company that used to sell a three-

149
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,160
tiered one that came with its own rack

150
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:40,519
that perfectly fit in the tent so you

151
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,960
didn't have to like line it up um and uh

152
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:45,198
I really missed the one that I got rid

153
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,198
of I'm like should have kept that

154
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,360
thing but yeah I don't really like

155
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,000
Perpetual very well because of my like

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,360
limited space if I had even just like

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,160
one more tent you know yeah my house is

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,520
a little on the smaller side and so I'm

159
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,560
l that I get to keep what I do and so um

160
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,198
I'm I kind of like don't plan it out

161
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,120
well as well as I should and I end up

162
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,759
like having to veg in the main space for

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,038
a decent amount of

164
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,240
time you reminded me that we talked

165
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,639
about these like POS possible idea to

166
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,840
have these little

167
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,439
isolated what would you call them like

168
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,399
Po pollination boxes was something yeah

169
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,680
like a grow cabinet type of thing like I

170
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,679
wanted to like have like a different

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,639
flowering chamber it doesn't have to be

172
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,478
very big so I'm only ever reversing like

173
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,199
one thing at a time and so that could be

174
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,959
like two small little one gallon pots or

175
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,319
something like that but I wanted to like

176
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,279
build a desk that had um like one side

177
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,199
for reversals and then like another side

178
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,839
where I could like then immediately take

179
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,400
the pollen and dust stuff in that I

180
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,079
wanted to work with without sacrificing

181
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,679
you know a 4x4 tent and making you know

182
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,359
you could make a pound of seed or more

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,800
in a 4x4 tent so it's a yeah a little

184
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,400
overkill for most of the stuff I'm

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,158
trying to do I don't you know sell my

186
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,679
seeds

187
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:07,279
so no that's cool that's really cool

188
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,918
okay well thanks for thanks all of you

189
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:13,959
for letting us kind of have a bit more

190
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:16,878
context for your your setup um maybe the

191
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:20,198
next thing that I wanted to prompt just

192
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,158
before we dive like right in is what are

193
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,960
the first thoughts that come to mind

194
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,598
when I say like prepare to flip or like

195
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,318
flipping or transition to flower I guess

196
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,158
two things that I really consider is

197
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,918
like the health of your plants and then

198
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,679
um the size cuz like you don't want to

199
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,240
flower things that are like too big cuz

200
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,239
I've done that I don't know how many

201
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,639
times but it just ends up becoming more

202
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,680
of a mess than anything um but also like

203
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,120
flowering a healthy plant is like your

204
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,958
best bet

205
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,959
because it's not going to like start

206
00:08:53,958 --> 00:09:00,078
starving off the bat so I don't know

207
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,679
that's just my opinion though

208
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,278
yeah I um I I tend to kind of do the

209
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,359
same stuff like when I'm like getting

210
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,799
ready to like preparing like you know

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,919
whatever cross it is that I'm gonna like

212
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm gonna flower all of them in one go

213
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,759
or if I'm gonna kind of like break it up

214
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,359
into multiple runs that kind of stuff um

215
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,519
when you start getting some numbers it

216
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,399
can be a little bit overwhelming as far

217
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,120
as like just looking through individual

218
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,958
plants um and I I kind of want to know

219
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,159
like each plant individually so that's

220
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,639
like a a thing that I you know I always

221
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,439
think about is like how many of these

222
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,799
plants can I really do and like be able

223
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,079
to focus my attention on them um

224
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:41,719
something else too um is uh like I like

225
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,159
to make sure that those plants are

226
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,160
backed up before I flip them

227
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,919
um sometimes you know it's I'm not

228
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:53,240
always lucky um but that's just a that's

229
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,719
a plus um when I first started growing I

230
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,000
remember one time I put a bunch of those

231
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,639
um 5 by5 veg pots and um I gritted them

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,679
out with blue dream in my tent and like

233
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,919
it was great like that PL will put on

234
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:11,000
like an epic single Cola and um you'll

235
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:14,199
just have like you know a sea of 48

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,839
tops it was great but a lot of stuff

237
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
won't do that I think I was I talking to

238
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,279
I think I was definitely talking to ER I

239
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
can't remember who else was in the

240
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,600
conversation like just yesterday I think

241
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,599
we were talking about there being this

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,680
threshold in terms of the number of

243
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,480
plants like that each individual can

244
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,879
manage Beyond which like they stop

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,039
becoming they stop really seeming like

246
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,439
individual plants um and they're just

247
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,159
more like a mess if if that makes sense

248
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,720
yeah yeah for sure and I think it's

249
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,278
different for everyone as well where

250
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,480
that threshold is because obviously that

251
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,838
depends on like your time energy you

252
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,879
know resources all that yeah yeah and it

253
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,760
all depends on like yeah like what what

254
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,838
you're allowed to do and like what works

255
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,399
for you and so uh um you know it's uh

256
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,680
it's always about just like getting to

257
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,958
know your plants and so um anyway um

258
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,000
yeah I like to look at just like the

259
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,838
size if I know the variety like you can

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,679
kind of start making some assumptions

261
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,440
based on like how it's going to feed and

262
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,039
like uh your media that you're going to

263
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,000
put it in and like what it prefers but

264
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,719
um I feel like a good base is always

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,320
just like a a cocoa or a soil run and

266
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,120
yeah two or three gallon pot and uh you

267
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,720
don't have to do like the one giant 20

268
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,120
gallon pot and there I've seen other

269
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,920
people do that too and I've never quite

270
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,200
understood it but um I did have a a

271
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:43,399
quick question for you Dan uh yeah when

272
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,200
you did the the single Cola blue dream

273
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,799
uh like sea of green did you find that

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,759
that like yielded as much as like you

275
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,120
know a couple fully grown three gallon

276
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,439
pots or like what was the yield like it

277
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,879
was like just slightly lower I think but

278
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,920
it was all tops and so it was like nicer

279
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,000
know and at that time like a lot of

280
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,519
people did like a lot of like scrog and

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,958
sea of green style plantings with like

282
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,679
hydro and stuff and so um it was like

283
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,559
more common I feel like at that point

284
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,958
than it is now yeah I would try to do

285
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,879
that again but it's just so hard when

286
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,919
you don't have like a single variety to

287
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,159
run at the same time like yeah this was

288
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,559
one clone on a flood tray so it was like

289
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,519
pretty pretty automated and it was in

290
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,799
like twofer

291
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,799
I've uh done a 4 by8 with uh I don't

292
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,599
know like 13 different varieties at one

293
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,000
time and it was just like it wasn't like

294
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,519
hard but it

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,639
was just good enough to get like I want

296
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,799
to say like an okay representation of

297
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:52,639
what things can be I don't know um it

298
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,639
wasn't my strongest grow but it was nice

299
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,919
to see a lot of

300
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
stuff yeah yeah exactly and that's what

301
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,439
I kind of do with my home stuff is just

302
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,078
like looking through different

303
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,600
populations and trying to find cool

304
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,399
plants and so um I'm always kind of

305
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,959
trying to like minmax what I can fit for

306
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:13,078
like the effort and to get the quality

307
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,919
and so um it's a challenge sometimes

308
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,359
though I set myself up for failure last

309
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,120
time and I put like I don't know it was

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,039
like 16 three gallons and they were just

311
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,679
like edge to edge and it was just like a

312
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,278
Mess by the end of it yeah I wasn't I

313
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,439
didn't actually like any of it either so

314
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,720
um so this is my first time actually

315
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,079
growing out of like three gallon cocoa

316
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,160
and I'm like [ __ ] mind blown at how

317
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:40,958
massive the [ __ ] buds get because I

318
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,480
like flowered strictly in ones and like

319
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:47,399
in ones I could get pretty sizable

320
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,959
buds um man the the threes I'm just like

321
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,198
holy [ __ ]

322
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:55,078
like man should I switch over like I

323
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:58,159
don't know but I kind of just like to

324
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,599
pop a bunch of seeds and it it the ones

325
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:04,198
kind of just suit my model the

326
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,480
most yeah for like the veg space I have

327
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:10,240
too keeping any like moms even in three

328
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,759
gallons it cuts me down like super super

329
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,320
limited and so uh um you know it's just

330
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,039
yeah it could just be a challenge on

331
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,560
those bigger pots but it's so much more

332
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,719
work when you're having to water twice a

333
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,758
day in a one gallon yeah so you know

334
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,360
it's uh it's I need to set up an

335
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,079
irrigation system also like that would

336
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,039
make my life so much easier if I just

337
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,879
had a five gallon bucket or something

338
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,278
like that outside the tent just plumbed

339
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,120
in like super basic on a sump or

340
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,679
something like that and um it prob it

341
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,720
wouldn't be very accurate as far as like

342
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,120
water distribution each pot but um it

343
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
would make my life a whole lot easier it

344
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,519
helps keep him alive right so you can

345
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,919
focus on other things um even I guess I

346
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,919
could just have it on a backup and just

347
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,479
have it at like 24 hours or whatever and

348
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,479
just have it do you know like a a really

349
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,039
quick water just so nothing dies if I

350
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,360
miss something but you know yeah totally

351
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,838
I'm like it just kind of sucks always

352
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,320
being tied down to the house right yeah

353
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,199
yeah exactly yeah you can't go

354
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,680
anywhere yeah oh man it's amazing to me

355
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:20,599
like how stress how stressful it is to

356
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:23,519
even plan like a few days away now yeah

357
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,440
man yeah sometimes I feel I really feel

358
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,639
bad for the [ __ ] plant sitter cuz

359
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,880
like I have a bunch of solos like one

360
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,360
gallon pots and flower and stuff and I'm

361
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:37,919
like oh my God like their their life is

362
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,639
about to be hell for an entire week um

363
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,198
but

364
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,198
yeah yeah and you you always notice when

365
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:47,240
you come back they're not they're not

366
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:49,479
very happy dude oh my God I was dude I

367
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,079
was really stoked to see this uh band

368
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,560
made Haze because it it was looking

369
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,719
really nice and then I come back and

370
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:57,518
like there's just like deficiencies and

371
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,278
I'm just like oh man like it doesn't

372
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,120
look terrible but

373
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,519
but it it could have been better it

374
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,600
could have gone better but here nor

375
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,159
there I guess yeah well the only reason

376
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
I brought like all this up was because I

377
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,399
feel like it kind of like leads into the

378
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,399
next topic thousand oh it definitely

379
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,958
does yeah and well you know like like

380
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,000
with any of these topics we'll end up

381
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:23,758
looping back inevitably right so um yeah

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,399
so I guess in terms of like drilling

383
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,000
into various aspects of the grow that

384
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,440
you might be thinking of when you are

385
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,958
preparing flip um obviously you already

386
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,839
mentioned some of these things but

387
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,239
um you could talk about you know any

388
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,680
training that you do before before flip

389
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,799
any like what kind of feed changes

390
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,039
you're preparing to do you know lights

391
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:51,639
IPM any of that really

392
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,519
um anyone yeah so like I've done a lot

393
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,360
of different things you know like I feel

394
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,720
like trellis in the end is the way to go

395
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,079
even on like a 4x4 it just limits access

396
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,318
and movement so much that I like avoid

397
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,198
doing it even though it's so [ __ ]

398
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,798
helpful um because it just makes

399
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,160
everything fixed at that point and then

400
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,400
you're kind of crawling on your hands

401
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,798
and knees trying to get little scoops of

402
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,480
water to the right plants and stuff and

403
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,599
so like I've I've been do you worry

404
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,798
about getting older and having to like

405
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,759
crawl around and stuff I'm starting to

406
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,439
do I'm starting to worry now yeah I mean

407
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,318
to a certain degree I mean I've already

408
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,000
got my own like you know Orthopedic

409
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,519
injuries and stuff like that and so you

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,919
know like I have a bad shoulder and a

411
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,639
bad knee already and so uh it definitely

412
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,919
makes it more complicated so that's why

413
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,759
I kind of still stick with like steaks

414
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,240
even though like I've almost lost an eye

415
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,720
a few times to like bamboo and plastic

416
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,599
steaks um but uh it just like lets me be

417
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,640
able to move plants out and uh you know

418
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,199
like pull a plant out to do de leafing

419
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,559
and stuff instead of trying to like work

420
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,798
in that cramped space in the tent even

421
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,000
though at the end of the day like I

422
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,599
would just love to have a trellis and so

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,960
um yeah that's that's kind of what I was

424
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,399
thinking about

425
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,200
that yeah I so like I kind of have a

426
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
little bit of a process down at this

427
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,480
point where I will like uh try to get

428
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,678
like a good aicle cutting off of my seed

429
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,000
mom that I can root up and then uh then

430
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,840
I have this plant that's like

431
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,519
essentially topped and like ready to

432
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:29,119
kind of be like trained out and

433
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,918
flowered um so that's kind of what I've

434
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,319
been doing uh so I'll you know I have

435
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,799
this plant that's topped it's got two

436
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,079
main tops and then I'll use just like

437
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,079
some clips in on the side of the pot and

438
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,720
a little bit of wire and just like kind

439
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,519
of spread the plants out just a little

440
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,079
bit at the start um and then later on

441
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,639
I'll I'll end up using like bamboo

442
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,798
steaks just for the reasons that Dan is

443
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,600
mentioning like I trellis is really nice

444
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:58,000
as far as like getting like a super even

445
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,959
canopy goes I think it's probably like

446
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,400
the probably the best way you know I

447
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:06,279
mean it's like a grit at the same

448
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,400
level um but it's just so tough for me

449
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,399
like if I'm in a 5x5 um I have mine like

450
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,720
sitting in the corner of my basement so

451
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,919
the back right corner of my is like

452
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,640
really hard to get to so

453
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,360
um yeah so I take my plants out and hand

454
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,280
water them and do all that stuff so I

455
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,038
can look at them and you know de leaf

456
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,000
and all that stuff so as much as I like

457
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,759
things about trellis it just makes it so

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,200
hard to do everything else that I want

459
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,798
to do um so yeah that's kind of like

460
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,558
what I'm I'm kind of just thinking about

461
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,400
like what local saying I want my plant

462
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,240
to be super healthy um I want the roots

463
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600
to look really good and I you know I

464
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,558
just want to feel confident about

465
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,759
flipping that we're going into like

466
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,759
ahead of the game you

467
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,519
know

468
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,240
nice did you get a bunch of

469
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,000
trick-or-treaters right

470
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,200
then did I'm sorry my dog is going to

471
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,480
these people it adds some festive you

472
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,759
know Vibes to the

473
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,759
episode very

474
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:15,200
festive yeah um so I pretty much just

475
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:19,359
like to my plants a little bit before

476
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,558
flower and then flip them but I mean

477
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,558
nothing really out of the

478
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,919
ordinary how about like

479
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,639
um how about in terms of like other

480
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,400
things I imagine by this point you know

481
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,038
your IPM if you were doing any you know

482
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,600
needed to have

483
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,640
been I what am I saying basically like

484
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,240
by the time you get to flower you

485
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,000
shouldn't be doing any more IPM right

486
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,079
like all that stuff should have happened

487
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,400
like up until this point um what about

488
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:50,839
what about like feeding during flip okay

489
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,640
maybe we move into into the actual like

490
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,639
first few weeks of flowering now

491
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:01,239
then I mean well I kind of don't spray

492
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,520
anything during flower I

493
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,240
mean um I don't release beneficials

494
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:12,440
either even though I should um like

495
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:15,720
nematodes um and other beneficial mides

496
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,640
um but that gets expensive

497
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,798
and yeah I don't know um what do you do

498
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,240
for your prep and veg just to keep

499
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:27,440
everything clean before you get there um

500
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,640
so like honestly I'm a huge user of

501
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,960
[ __ ] uh suffoil X dude I don't know

502
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,960
like it's it's just like it gets

503
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:41,558
everything um it just sucks like you

504
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:44,079
can't drench it obviously but like I

505
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:47,599
mean other than that like it gets all

506
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:51,079
soft-bodied insects which is like 99% of

507
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,000
the problems that people run into I've

508
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,240
never really had a PM

509
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,960
issue um but people say you can use it

510
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,880
for that I I don't know

511
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,440
um but um yeah I've used like uh Grand

512
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,559
Deo in the past um regalia I've had like

513
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,480
Panic 5.0 but that [ __ ] is [ __ ]

514
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:16,278
ridiculously expensive all of that [ __ ]

515
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,558
you just listed is dude yeah it's it's

516
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:21,079
hard and the reason why I like get S oil

517
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,119
is because it's like $80 for like two

518
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,960
and a half gallons and like that'll last

519
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,319
you

520
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,319
forever yeah I've just had like issues

521
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,480
finding like a good dilution but like I

522
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,399
didn't stick with the SE oil very long

523
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,599
just cuz I well I already knew all these

524
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,159
other things that like I had tried and

525
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:40,719
worked for me um so like I I try to do

526
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,720
like enzyme sprays early on like a Nukem

527
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
or a Dr zymes and then like a few weeks

528
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,679
before

529
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,520
flour um if we're looking at like I

530
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,880
don't know like a six week time frame

531
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,639
from sprouting a seed to flipping it

532
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,559
maybe a little longer I'll save like

533
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,679
those last like two or three weeks and

534
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:01,000
two sprays and I'll get some sulfur on

535
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:04,798
the plant Micron nice sulur nice um so

536
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,159
I've tried to use like um [ __ ] Nukem

537
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:10,278
or doctor zes but every time it's just

538
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,240
like led to phytotoxicity like even at

539
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:15,278
their lowest dosage and I'm just like

540
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,278
you know what like I don't know like

541
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:22,359
it's just you can't let any light on it

542
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:24,599
at all yeah it's it's it's a tough one

543
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:28,278
so I kind of just like use the oil and

544
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:30,399
my plants look way happy after it too so

545
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:33,679
yeah yeah that's the

546
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,120
thing I had some spiderm issues in my

547
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,360
Nursery earlier this year and I spoke to

548
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:42,199
local about it um and mineral oil spray

549
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,798
did actually work out pretty well for me

550
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,960
just using regularly um which I was

551
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,960
grateful for because I know I know

552
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,319
spidermites can get really out of hand

553
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,360
really quick yeah yeah you might be

554
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:56,798
using a shot back to clean them off your

555
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,399
buds at the end at that point you know

556
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,158
when they get real bad

557
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,640
um yeah yeah so I I actually you guys

558
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,679
are kind of convincing me I kind of want

559
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,320
to go back and try it now but I always

560
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,480
like tried to do a few different things

561
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,720
just to like mix mode of action and like

562
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,599
the oils same thing as the enzymes kind

563
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,720
of limit you on like what else you can

564
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,278
use but that's an interesting point yeah

565
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,079
that's kind of why I got like some of

566
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,359
the venerate stuff because I was like

567
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,879
you know like I mean well I guess the

568
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,119
way I think of it is like the sulfur is

569
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,200
like or not sfur the S oil X or

570
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:37,639
horiculture oil I guess um in any

571
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,000
instance um like no bug can really gain

572
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,278
adaptability cuz like you're literally

573
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,599
like suffocating it by like clogging its

574
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:47,558
pores with oils so it's like you're not

575
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,839
going to gain a resistance but like I

576
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:53,158
still do want like a mode of action to

577
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,759
get things that maybe didn't get hit the

578
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,120
first time or whatever you know what I

579
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,440
mean like it's it's just good practice

580
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,119
but I don't know diversity of tactics is

581
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,519
always good for this kind of totally and

582
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,639
I think like the limiting like factor

583
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:10,679
for a lot of people is like money is uh

584
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:15,200
IPM is [ __ ] expensive man

585
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:19,038
like I guess like yeah it's it's it is

586
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,440
expensive but it's worth it like yeah

587
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,519
people oh go ahead I was just gonna say

588
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,679
like the reality of it is it's like if

589
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,558
you're taking cuts in or anything like

590
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
that it's like you're going to have to

591
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:32,119
like have an

592
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,319
IPM yeah and so like if people listening

593
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,519
like kind of don't know what we're

594
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,839
talking about it's more just that like a

595
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,319
different sprays will have a different

596
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,199
Mo of action of how they're killing

597
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,398
insects and so like with the mineral oil

598
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,200
example of the horticultural oil um bugs

599
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,599
breathe through small pores on their

600
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,679
abdomen and not out of their mouths and

601
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,079
head and so if you cover that in oil

602
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,559
they can't breathe and they suffocate

603
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,720
and die hence like the suffix oil

604
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,079
whereas like there are other sprays that

605
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,919
have like an active compon component

606
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,720
that's a a neurotoxin or something like

607
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,120
that of that nature or like the enzyme

608
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,278
sprays do really well at literally like

609
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,798
dissolving their exoskeleton and so um

610
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,000
yeah there's a bunch of different ways

611
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,038
to attack the same bug and you know some

612
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,960
are more effective than others what is

613
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,319
the strategy for light lighting uh when

614
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,519
you're when you're flipping for you guys

615
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:29,158
I mean I kind of run my light um at 80%

616
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,398
and then kind of maybe alod to 90 but

617
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:35,080
100% it's like way too intense in my

618
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:38,038
opinion mhm but that 80 to 90 range is

619
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:40,398
like kind of where I'd like to be

620
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,398
um but yeah I don't know I don't really

621
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,519
[ __ ] around with lighting too much like

622
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:49,158
that

623
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:54,079
um but yeah yeah I use my um I I use

624
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:56,880
that app on uh iPhone phone like just

625
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,599
kind of get like a general idea of where

626
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,919
my lighting is

627
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:05,359
um you know uh I'm not going to speak to

628
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,278
its accuracy as far as like compared to

629
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:12,240
a um actual like you know par meter um

630
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,240
because I don't have a par meter I'm

631
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,759
cheap and and I'm not going to spend

632
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,159
$500 uh to get like kind of pretty much

633
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:25,720
you want to buy Bruce bug's light

634
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,960
meter no not particularly um oh man

635
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,880
they're G to go after you in the

636
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,200
comments again bro

637
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,000
listen sorry I sorry I'll just say real

638
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,000
quick

639
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,759
$500 yeah dude they're money I'll

640
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,599
apologize to Bruce bugby right now and

641
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:48,359
just say sorry that's yeah unnecessary

642
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:50,000
stray yeah so I use the um the photon

643
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,639
there's a guy that I used to watch on

644
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,319
YouTube that does some like Light

645
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:59,038
reviews and stuff um that has done uh

646
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,798
side side by side comparisons of the app

647
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,200
with the the uh par meter and it was

648
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,599
like it was close enough that I felt

649
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,798
comfortable to use it so um so I use

650
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:14,959
that and just kind of get myself into

651
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:17,079
like a decent range um I kind of like to

652
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,558
um I don't want to be coming in cooking

653
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:21,599
on the lights at the beginning of flower

654
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,599
because I want to have some like room to

655
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,839
go as the plants start to you know

656
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,798
stretch and that kind of thing um so I I

657
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,079
do kind of like to be on like the lower

658
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:35,720
end of where I want to be to start just

659
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,918
so I have you know some room to increase

660
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,880
through flower um I'll also mention just

661
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,880
because Ern was uh saying that he'll

662
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,240
like gradually increase the ligh um but

663
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,799
um I'll raise my light to like the

664
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,839
absolute like highest it can be like

665
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,119
like

666
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,839
height-wise um and then I'll increase

667
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:59,839
the intensity to like 80 to 90% so it's

668
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,038
not like they're it's right up on them

669
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,038
or

670
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,519
anything yeah I can give like a little

671
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,360
context into like the commercial side of

672
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,120
it where it's a lot of commercial Grow

673
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:15,798
rooms kind of hang out around 650 to 750

674
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:18,879
microm malls of light at canopy height

675
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:21,440
and um a lot of these lights will push

676
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,720
2,000 if you have it dropped right on

677
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,399
top of your canopy and so like one of

678
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,120
the things I was thinking about is like

679
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:29,639
a newer grower who just got a light for

680
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:32,639
the first time and doesn't really have

681
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,679
any experience with it um you're kind of

682
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,278
stuck with trial and error to see like

683
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,919
what the plants you're working with will

684
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:39,558
like that's coming out of that light but

685
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,038
I didn't actually know about this app

686
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,200
that ER was talking about and so I'm

687
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,558
going to have to check that out as well

688
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,000
um because I think that could be really

689
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:51,038
useful um I'll also mention too like um

690
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,960
I'm a pretty recent LED grower I used to

691
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:57,119
grow a lot under

692
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,079
CMH um and I've noticed that led kind of

693
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,158
has its own like set of nutritional

694
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,480
problems that doesn't particularly come

695
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,440
with CMH like I found CMH plants to kind

696
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,919
of just always look healthy like there's

697
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,720
no weird like discoloration in the leaf

698
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:19,080
or any of that but that's just been my

699
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,240
observation um but what did you find was

700
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:25,480
like lacking I don't know like it just

701
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,839
it kind of always like seemed to be

702
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,038
either like magnesium or pot iium or

703
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,038
something like that yeah that's kind of

704
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,038
what I've seen too is like some

705
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,798
potassium sulfate helps a lot with that

706
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:39,519
led stress like the red stems and the

707
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,119
the kind of yellowing of the leaves yeah

708
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,120
and that's like something that I don't

709
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,158
have at the moment is like anything to

710
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,158
manipulate potassium independently and I

711
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,320
like that would [ __ ] help a lot yeah

712
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,960
I think we were actually like just

713
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,879
talking about that I was actually gonna

714
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,880
say I actually I actually just started

715
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,960
using that um

716
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,639
just like a f potassium supplement from

717
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,919
um nectar for the Gods uh I can't

718
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:07,038
remember the name of it it doesn't

719
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:11,440
matter who it came from but it's a

720
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:14,679
pottassium and um yeah I think it seems

721
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,720
to like I I did a Fier spray in early

722
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,519
flower on these um banana Haze plants

723
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,558
that I'm growing because one of them

724
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,960
stretched like pretty hard and just had

725
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,000
some I mean it didn't look like it just

726
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,319
looked like on the edge of underfed kind

727
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,398
of you know what I mean it's not it's

728
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,519
like you look at it and you're like this

729
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,319
plant doesn't look like incredible but

730
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,440
it doesn't look bad either uh so I don't

731
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,519
know so I tried that and it does seem to

732
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,798
be helping um and now I've just been

733
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:45,798
using it like as like a just mixing it

734
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,879
in with my feed like once a once a week

735
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,079
or whatever and it seems to have knocked

736
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,440
that issue

737
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,638
out um but

738
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,519
yeah I think I think like I started with

739
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:01,519
LED

740
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:06,720
so I never had that that learning curve

741
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:10,120
coming you know uh like

742
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,519
from so I just think like I think that

743
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,359
like I don't know I I feel like I

744
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,319
haven't ran into some of these problems

745
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,879
and it's not necessarily because I'm

746
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,839
like good or anything like that or

747
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,639
better than anyone it's just because

748
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:26,359
like I that's where I started and like I

749
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:28,278
got rid of those issues quickly or

750
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,959
whatever I don't know cool I mean yeah

751
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:34,919
anything else about feeding then since

752
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,240
we're also touching on that a bit yeah

753
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,278
yeah um I guess with feeding like

754
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,839
especially if you're early on like going

755
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:47,278
and getting like a basic like three or

756
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:48,678
four part program is um not a bad thing

757
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,319
at all I think you're going to be so

758
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,519
much happier with the results than if

759
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,200
you try and like reinvent the wheel

760
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,558
because you can piece it together a

761
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,319
little cheaper and make stock Solutions

762
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,798
and do all that but for the effort like

763
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,480
you're probably going to have a steeper

764
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,558
learning curve learning how to like

765
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,399
formulate a recipe more than just even

766
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,319
learning to grow weed and so uh I know a

767
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,278
lot of the guys on here like to rock

768
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,879
Cana I've used Cana in the past and I

769
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:17,079
really like it um I kind of like

770
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
something a little simpler and so like

771
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,398
I've been rocking Cutting Edge again

772
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,240
because that's what I started out with

773
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,239
earlier on and used to grow really nice

774
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,359
weed with it and so I've just kind of

775
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,319
added a few organic supplements along

776
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,158
the way to like a the TP tea from Roots

777
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,599
organic is a nice like dry Amendment

778
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,278
powder just to give a nice little boost

779
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:39,158
here and there and uh kind of diversify

780
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:43,599
what you're offering the plant so it can

781
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:45,440
do its thing yeah um so I've grown a few

782
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,278
different with a few different nutrients

783
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,919
with the cocoa stuff um like I've done

784
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:55,000
the the Lucas like the two part like

785
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,120
with h add added Epsom salts so my water

786
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,159
is pretty high in calcium so like CAG

787
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:03,798
was never really like a solution to any

788
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,760
of my [ __ ] problems ever yeah um but

789
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:09,159
it was like a quote on quote Lucas

790
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:13,199
modified you know type of thing um I've

791
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:15,480
done like the Maxi Bloom um Lucas style

792
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:19,519
thing like with seven and a half grams

793
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,440
of like Maxi Bloom to one gallon of

794
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,239
water that works the same as Lucas I

795
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,159
think it's really nice uh the only

796
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,239
downfall is it's a [ __ ] to [ __ ]

797
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,200
dissolve dude like even with hot water

798
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,678
you're

799
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:36,118
struggling um I've done the ja

800
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,159
321 um I'll say like you'll get really

801
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,679
nice sizable plants but like the issue

802
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,679
with it is it doesn't work for all

803
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,720
strains like it won't work for something

804
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,159
like a blueberry I don't know like it it

805
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,000
I've seen like [ __ ] like Kush mins

806
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,280
and all that kind of stuff like Crush

807
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,920
under that kind of Ja 321 like 3.0 EC

808
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,280
kind of thing um yeah

809
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,280
uh Kaa um I've liked it but I'll be 100%

810
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,839
honest man like the Lucas formula kind

811
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,200
of just like gives the nicest average

812
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,000
for the amount of like money that you

813
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,118
put

814
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,760
in um of everything I've tried so far

815
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,240
with Coco like I've done General Hydra

816
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,839
three part I've done like you know

817
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:25,239
several different like nutrient lines I

818
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,838
did you know I I don't know I I think

819
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,279
like if you get like a decent new

820
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:31,320
nutrient

821
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,640
program you're it's going to be

822
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,960
okay for the most part you know I mean

823
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:42,000
um I do try to think about like I I

824
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,559
noticed like with Cana um like my my

825
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,639
water comes out like very very soft like

826
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:52,799
10 PPM um so I I do use some cow mag you

827
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:56,318
know um but if I mix like if I mix like

828
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,359
full shrink flow notes with can with you

829
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,838
know

830
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,880
some cow mag and that kind of stuff you

831
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,239
know quickly you're getting up into this

832
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,720
like two and a half three C range where

833
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:10,759
I I don't really want to be feeding like

834
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:12,559
super hot like that you know um so I've

835
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,359
been trying to just kind of break my

836
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,318
feedings up a little bit and like kind

837
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:20,880
of like do do like you know like Cano

838
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:22,880
one day and then on the next watering do

839
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,599
um you know some cow mag and like the

840
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,079
potassium and you know that kind of

841
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,838
thing just kind of trying to break it up

842
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,079
a little bit just I you know I'm still

843
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:32,960
very much just trying to find like uh

844
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,318
where I like to

845
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,039
be yeah like one of these things that

846
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,719
the dudes at the grow shop I used to

847
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,759
work at always used to say when I was

848
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,919
like first learning about things is like

849
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,280
it all works Dan like it's uh it's about

850
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,079
what's cheapest you know and so like

851
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,640
I've actually grown pretty good weed

852
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,720
with just like 20 2020 and then 0 5050

853
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,679
and I would fully spray sea green which

854
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,239
is like a fish hydrate like compost tea

855
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,799
extract and um as long as you have like

856
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,959
good soil it's makes life a whole lot

857
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,960
more forgiving that's like something I'm

858
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,358
relearning with like promix and like

859
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:12,000
more inert Hydro style peep Medias and

860
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:15,960
with Coco is that um uh having like a

861
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,519
really well Blended like a um Royal gold

862
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,880
makes really good soil it's kind of like

863
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,679
what I'm thinking of and forest floor

864
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,680
Organics up in Eugene organ or they're

865
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,159
just south of Eugene but they make

866
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:29,480
really great soil with the byproduct

867
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,879
from the logging industry up here and uh

868
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,838
they it's all composted really nicely in

869
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,920
their yard and um I've noticed that not

870
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,679
using that I grow way dumpier weed kind

871
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,639
of regardless of the uh the nutrients

872
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,759
and so having a really nice soil blend

873
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,358
can help make your life a lot easier

874
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,560
especially earlier on before you've got

875
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,199
your whole system dialed and before uh

876
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,759
you know you really get to know what

877
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,118
you're doing I want to come back to

878
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,599
feeding

879
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,039
tactics at like distinct points of

880
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,200
flower but I think uh if we can like

881
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:08,440
maybe just wrap up this little bit on

882
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:12,559
like General thoughts on like uh the

883
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,280
transition and all that um so other

884
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,318
questions I had were like how do you all

885
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,040
deal with like managing humidity airf

886
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:22,199
flow how much cleaning up is happening

887
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,159
uh around the stretch like are you

888
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:28,279
pruning defoliating much lollipopping

889
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,920
all that yeah I I've done it a bunch of

890
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,720
different ways like I used to do the

891
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,240
lollipop style because even with like a

892
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,480
room kind of stacked with gavitas like

893
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,919
it just doesn't you don't really get

894
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,519
amazing light

895
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,920
penetration and uh I feel like I was

896
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:47,400
leaving a lot of weight on the table by

897
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,559
stripping really heavily up to the first

898
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,358
trellis and um the kind of the style I'm

899
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:55,639
more going for now is a little bit more

900
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:57,279
defoliating but consistently to maintain

901
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:59,759
that light penetration all the way down

902
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,200
and so I don't really go hard on Def I

903
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,000
kind of just like every time I'm

904
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,039
checking in I take a few leaves here or

905
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,599
there for kind of just open up certain

906
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,599
flowering

907
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,599
spots yeah I kind of tend to do the same

908
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,679
thing as far as defoliation goes like

909
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,519
when I'm I I take like I said like um

910
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,239
I'm in three gallon cocoa so and I water

911
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,519
like hand water take them out set them

912
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:27,879
on my bench and like you know that kind

913
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:30,719
of thing so um I'll take them out like

914
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,680
during flow I'm watering sometimes daily

915
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,959
maybe every other day you know so I'll

916
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:36,719
take these plants out and like just kind

917
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,679
of go through and just look and like if

918
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,118
there's stuff that like is blocking or

919
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:42,519
like looks like it's not getting that

920
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,358
much light I'll you know I'll remove it

921
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,679
I'm not like lollipopping but I do

922
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,400
remove some of the like lower Buds and

923
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,919
stuff just that I know are going to end

924
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,200
up being just like you know kind of

925
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,280
boofy and stuff that like I don't really

926
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,078
want to mess with anyways so I'll get

927
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,200
rid of that stuff and then otherwise I

928
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,079
kind of just try to leave them

929
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:08,559
alone I like leaving like a very uh kind

930
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,880
of certain like uh ratio I guess of like

931
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,159
ly or popcorn stuff at the bottom just

932
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,519
because like that's the stuff that I'll

933
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:19,719
just quick try and like get use as

934
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:21,800
samples early on but yeah loal yeah um

935
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:25,199
I'll like so I wouldn't say like I

936
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,760
lollipop my plants particularly cuz like

937
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:31,199
you know I don't get them like that like

938
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,800
[ __ ] wide or whatever um because like

939
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,279
I crowd my tent with like one gallon

940
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,920
pots um so I kind of just strip all the

941
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,560
lower stuff and like let them like shoot

942
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,760
up instead of like out wide

943
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,838
um but yeah other than that like there's

944
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,000
no specific like shape that I go for

945
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:55,440
other than the like making sure they're

946
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,318
not bumping into each other and stuff

947
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,318
like that um

948
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:02,279
the one thing I've noticed with LEDs is

949
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:04,960
like the light penetration with them so

950
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,920
it is nice to get some of that ly stuff

951
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,440
but I'm kind of Onie with that

952
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,318
1,000 um I don't like like pick it out

953
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,880
particularly because I do like to smoke

954
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:21,440
it early on and I am a little lazy I'll

955
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,160
admit well and like what some people do

956
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,960
especially like outdoor Growers and

957
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,759
Greenhouse guys like if you have the

958
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,079
ability to and the space and no

959
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,319
restrictions about it is um a lot of

960
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,079
people will take tops and like kind of

961
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:35,838
take the top half of the plant and then

962
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,760
leave the lowers for another like week

963
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,239
to 10 days to let them firm up a little

964
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,359
bit too yeah yeah and so like um

965
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,919
especially outdoor on like larger plants

966
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,920
that's like really key because that

967
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,519
interior canopy is never quite as done

968
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,519
as those top

969
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,519
extremities um yeah so um thousand I

970
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,039
know you were asking about like

971
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:59,000
feeding um so once thing like I've

972
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,199
noticed with a lot of plants is like you

973
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,679
can kind of continue that like same veg

974
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,239
diet all the way through um and then

975
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,519
there's some that'll take like a full

976
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:10,399
strain veg um and then you like try to

977
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,280
apply that into flower and I've noticed

978
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,200
some of them will like show like some

979
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,839
nitrogen toxicity like a little bit of

980
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,759
clawing on like the new growth and stuff

981
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,400
and so I'll just kind of subtract it

982
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,480
from like the part that contains a

983
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,838
little more

984
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,318
nitrogen um but other than that like

985
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,039
it's kind of like it's it's hard to know

986
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,960
when you like pop seeds and you're

987
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,039
throwing them into flower the first time

988
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,599
but like exactly the second go yeah the

989
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,119
second go around like that's when you

990
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,599
can kind of make your tweaks and kind of

991
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,680
adjust each um individuals like um

992
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,960
formula and [ __ ] like that

993
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:47,838
but it makes sense because it's like you

994
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,280
can't really play ketchup in flow

995
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,199
exactly yeah uh just quickly I think you

996
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,519
all mentioned this already when you were

997
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:59,558
talking about your setups but uh

998
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:02,639
humidity control AC's

999
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:05,480
dehumidifiers um so I'll I'll have my AC

1000
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,358
running like all the time um I like to

1001
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,679
get like cooler nighttime temps

1002
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:13,639
um but like in terms of like humidity

1003
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,480
and stuff since I have like the AC

1004
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:18,519
running it does get a little cool and

1005
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,960
dry but I also have like fan like the

1006
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:25,480
small like um not like uh desktop fans

1007
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,880
but they're like I don't know 12in fans

1008
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,599
something like that 14 inch like on the

1009
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,318
front floor and then the back

1010
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,200
floor um and then they'll move air on

1011
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:37,679
the floor and then I have some strap to

1012
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:41,960
the top of the tent like right at the

1013
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:44,719
entrance um but that's really it for air

1014
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,599
movement yeah I have just like a small

1015
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:51,118
deum um inside the tent that I use um

1016
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,519
luckily nowadays there's actually small

1017
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,280
Deus that actually work um they didn't

1018
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,480
used to be that way so like when I first

1019
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,319
started growing even even if you had a

1020
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,920
4x4 tent like you kind of had to figure

1021
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,400
out how to work in this you know like

1022
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,480
two foot tall by like a foot wide by

1023
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,160
like eight to 10 inches like this just

1024
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,599
Big Unit almost the size of a small AC

1025
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,759
that like you had to just like cram in

1026
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,240
the tent with it you know or else you

1027
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,200
just had like no real control over that

1028
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:20,199
I have a question here about this like

1029
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,279
in my mind I thought it would be

1030
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,919
somehow I don't know if more effective

1031
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,519
is the right term but I thought that

1032
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,519
like it was the lung room that should be

1033
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,519
dehumid

1034
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:32,440
not the like inside Space because that

1035
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,800
space is you know having air kind of

1036
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,760
going like passing through it yeah um

1037
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,440
but I don't know I'm curious what yeah

1038
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,440
so so mine's kind of set up on a timed

1039
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,000
exhaust and so like I'm not always

1040
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,559
exhausting but it's set up on a timer to

1041
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,679
where it does it like once an hour um

1042
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:53,280
for like 15 minutes uh and then I have

1043
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,480
my AC kind of like blowing like pulling

1044
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,960
from my lung room which just my office

1045
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,240
you know um and that's kind of influx in

1046
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,639
cool or you know refreshen air a little

1047
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,318
more often because if you think about it

1048
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,000
with your AC um unless your whole room

1049
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:08,800
is AC it kind of just depends on where

1050
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,960
you live because when I used to live on

1051
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,839
the coast we didn't need AC we just

1052
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,280
pulled in that 65 degree air from

1053
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:17,480
outside and at night it goes down to

1054
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,119
like 45 um but that air was always

1055
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,679
really humid you know so that just meant

1056
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:25,960
more deems that you need but you don't

1057
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:28,838
have AC luckily AC's act as the human

1058
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,400
Ires all on their own and so um a lot of

1059
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:32,000
people especially in like California

1060
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,559
where it's drier for a lot of the year

1061
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,559
you can get by without a de at

1062
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:41,879
all yeah so I was going to say I use um

1063
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,920
like as far as like the lung Grom kind

1064
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,960
of situation is it's my basement you

1065
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,200
know so uh I just want my basement to be

1066
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,920
generally

1067
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:57,159
dry being like a good house owner kind

1068
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:01,159
of thing you know but um so uh I do have

1069
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:04,318
like a some of those like portable um

1070
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:07,279
AC's I have two of them um but really I

1071
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,039
only use one of them most of the time um

1072
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,160
I have a hose hooked up to it and I'll

1073
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:16,400
run it in dry mode and just let it um

1074
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:20,759
dehumidify constantly um because like

1075
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:24,160
this year uh like until today actually

1076
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,640
it's cold now but um it's been like 85%

1077
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,719
humidity here like all summer it seems

1078
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,879
like so it's I mean it's been a even to

1079
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:35,118
just get me get me down to like 60% uh

1080
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,039
humidity is about as far as I've been

1081
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,640
able to get just with it this year um

1082
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,119
but now that it's getting cold and stuff

1083
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,159
I won't need to run

1084
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,680
dehumidifier I'll just run an air

1085
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:47,480
conditioner in my basement you know just

1086
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:51,399
for it to be like comfortable um and

1087
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:54,280
then I have two of those um like

1088
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,400
hurricane like oscillating fans I have

1089
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,760
those like mounted just like moving air

1090
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,599
around in my basement I wanted us to

1091
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,280
move into kind of looking more at the

1092
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,720
progression of the different stages of

1093
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,839
flower but I had a thought which is just

1094
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:11,000
before we do that I wanted to ask Dan if

1095
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,759
there was like any notable differences

1096
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,639
when he thinks about this for work or

1097
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,200
you know at the facility versus thinking

1098
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,679
about it at home even on like a broad

1099
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,199
level like what are the major things

1100
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,159
that are different that kind of jump out

1101
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,960
to you

1102
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:26,000
Dan um I mean the major thing at scale

1103
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,199
is just cost you know like I can't for

1104
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,318
to buy anything liquid you know so like

1105
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,399
that just means like stock tanks and

1106
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:35,400
direct injection for like fertigation

1107
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,760
systems and stuff like an Argus or a

1108
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,920
Privia or even just some

1109
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,040
dosatrons um and so it's just kind of a

1110
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,838
completely different realm as far as

1111
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,159
that goes because like most people are

1112
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,558
just running like either a custom Blend

1113
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:54,759
or a purchase blend of salt

1114
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,440
fertilizers um but like at home um I

1115
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,319
used to have like a whole thing when I

1116
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,720
was like doing more Organics where I'm

1117
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,519
like all right I'm going to like feed

1118
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,399
seaweed until this date and then I'm

1119
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,759
going to top dress with um you know like

1120
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,639
worm castings like once a week for those

1121
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,599
two first two weeks of flour and like

1122
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:14,400
get a bloom powder in there and then uh

1123
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,599
I had this whole progression and like it

1124
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,559
grew nice weed but like now looking back

1125
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:22,838
I feel like it's pretty excessive and so

1126
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,559
um I think the one thing that might be

1127
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:26,159
like a tidbit that goes against like

1128
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,319
common bro knowledge

1129
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:31,920
is that the phosphorus intake that your

1130
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:34,000
plant wants is they need it immediately

1131
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,720
starting in flour you know which means

1132
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,838
that you probably needed to water it in

1133
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,039
like a week before you flip and get

1134
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,039
those levels up within the plant and uh

1135
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:44,039
traditional knowledge is more like push

1136
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:46,639
phosphorus and potassium at the end of

1137
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,920
flow for like the last four weeks and

1138
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,480
I've never really understood the thought

1139
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,720
behind that because like if you think

1140
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,400
about a plant that's flowering it's

1141
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,519
doing this massive amount of cell

1142
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,200
division at each node and then those

1143
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,480
cells all just like expand with water

1144
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:05,318
and so I'm not really exactly sure what

1145
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,159
like a huge phosphorus or potassium dose

1146
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:09,480
at the end really does besides just like

1147
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:11,719
make your flowers super dense which is

1148
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,079
kind of the original point but I think

1149
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:16,480
to facilitate it it's much better to do

1150
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,160
it like right around the transition time

1151
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,400
and keep that going for the first week

1152
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,159
or two and then you can kind of go on a

1153
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,798
more base feed from that point cool yeah

1154
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:26,519
I've not heard that before so that's

1155
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,159
definitely a new thing for me to think

1156
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,400
about

1157
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,480
um well you kind of you kind of got it

1158
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,798
started there right so in your mind what

1159
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,960
are like the

1160
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:38,400
distinct you know not distinct but you

1161
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,079
know what are the loose stages of

1162
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,200
flowering you know obviously in the

1163
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:45,680
stretch that's quite an obvious one how

1164
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,719
do you all see like the flowering the

1165
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,879
entire process kind of being divided

1166
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,480
Loosely yeah for me it's just cell

1167
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,920
division and

1168
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,760
expansion and so that's like yeah weeks

1169
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,000
one through three while the plants

1170
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,319
elongating the you see those flowers

1171
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,199
forming and after that it's kind of just

1172
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:05,440
like I like to just get out the way you

1173
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,039
know and and kind of let it do its thing

1174
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,480
and so I don't really have any secret

1175
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,599
sauce for flower you know what I mean

1176
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,039
besides like setting the plant up to be

1177
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,760
able to Sprint when the time

1178
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,279
comes okay well in terms of what about

1179
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,160
the rest of you like in terms of feeding

1180
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,280
at these different Junctions like what's

1181
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:26,679
changing or like any any of those other

1182
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,519
parameters feeding uh lights you know

1183
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:32,519
what's changing in the course of like

1184
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,119
flowering um so I'll just mention that

1185
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:37,798
like my diet doesn't really like the

1186
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,039
plants I guess the way I feed my plants

1187
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:42,318
like their diet isn't particularly like

1188
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:44,599
changing a lot like I'm still keeping

1189
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,599
the same formula the same ratios and

1190
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:49,200
stuff that like Cana

1191
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:51,000
provides um it's just like sometimes I

1192
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,679
notice like a little bit of nitrogen

1193
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,760
toxicity so I'll back off on one part um

1194
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,039
but like other than that like I'll keep

1195
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,119
the feed the same all the way through

1196
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:05,599
but like the one thing I've noticed is

1197
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:08,079
like they don't like have a a potassium

1198
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,240
supplement that's separate and it's like

1199
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,280
since I already add potass or um uh

1200
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:14,919
calcium

1201
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:18,880
phosphate um it's like I don't need to

1202
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,920
add the PK like I need to add some K you

1203
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,119
know what I mean I don't know but yeah

1204
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,039
other than that like there's no specific

1205
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:30,160
like Diet it's like I I'm not like

1206
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:32,358
really ramping up P or k at any specific

1207
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,239
time like I just want to add enough to

1208
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:37,000
kind

1209
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:40,639
of compensate for the addition of like

1210
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,280
phosphorus in my medium so so with Kaa

1211
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,318
I'm not like as familiar I don't really

1212
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,160
remember do they have you like a week to

1213
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,159
week recipe chart where they're kind of

1214
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,078
like changing and shifting ratios or do

1215
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,399
they just have like a bloom like rate to

1216
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,640
use things so it's kind of like you

1217
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,760
maintain your onetoone usage of A and B

1218
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,318
right yeah and then you'll notice like

1219
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,799
as the flowering progresses you'll kind

1220
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:08,558
of up you know up until like I don't

1221
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:11,798
know like maybe week six to seven and

1222
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,680
then you yeah so like the there the can

1223
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:18,119
of formula is based off of like eight to

1224
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:21,118
nine week plants um so it uh looking at

1225
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,798
it it it's like around like week four or

1226
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:28,000
five they is when you're hitting like

1227
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:30,400
the highest amount of feed um and you're

1228
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,798
kind of coming in I use like I'm using

1229
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,000
the PK booster like they recommend just

1230
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:36,639
to see because I haven't used it before

1231
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,159
so I just kind of want to see if it was

1232
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:42,440
going to make a difference

1233
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:46,239
um but it it kind of ramps up to

1234
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:48,358
somewhere around like 1.8 EC and then

1235
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,039
that's like around like week five and

1236
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:52,480
then it kind of just starts it kind of

1237
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,000
comes down a little bit and then to

1238
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,039
about like 1.2 EC and then it stays

1239
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,519
there

1240
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:01,480
until um you know until you finish or

1241
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,199
whatever have you guys ever played

1242
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:06,159
around with like any different um like

1243
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,919
Bloom booster quote unques and I don't

1244
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,598
mean just like a straight PK but there's

1245
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,000
like products like Advanced Nutrients

1246
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,798
overdrive or House and Garden shooting

1247
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,400
powder um that I've noticed after using

1248
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:19,798
them a few times in like commercial

1249
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,720
capacities that they kind of do have

1250
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:25,400
something in them I have no idea what it

1251
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:27,719
is um that you can kind of reestablish

1252
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,440
an earlier flower set and it lets it

1253
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,959
basically you see the plant shoot a

1254
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,599
bunch of white hairs again when it was

1255
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,240
already kind of starting to die back in

1256
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,280
siness a little bit and they used to

1257
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:38,759
recommend it in like week seven but I

1258
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,480
think they've changed that to like five

1259
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,240
or six now um and that's kind of how

1260
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,880
people used to use it and recommend to

1261
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:48,759
use it um before they changed it because

1262
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,519
like I I worked for the company that was

1263
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:55,000
had the licens to distribute House and

1264
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:55,960
Garden in the in the US back then and so

1265
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,480
um

1266
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,519
it's just funny how things change like

1267
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,599
that but have you guys ever used

1268
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:04,759
anything like

1269
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:07,200
that um I used uh the one that General

1270
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,680
Hydro makes it has like a sunflower on

1271
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:13,480
the front of it um it's like

1272
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:16,679
a I I'll look at the name really quick

1273
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:19,519
but it you know it has it's like a right

1274
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:21,519
liquido yeah yeah I used to [ __ ] with

1275
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:26,480
that stuff a lot yeah yeah that's that's

1276
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:29,318
good man um yeah it's it's tough like

1277
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,400
there's a point where you can be using

1278
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:33,759
all these different inputs and It's just

1279
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,519
tough to tell like what's doing what for

1280
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:40,599
me sometimes um

1281
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:43,719
so yes I did use it but like when I was

1282
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:45,760
using it I was also using a plethora of

1283
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:48,879
other stuff so I can't say that I like

1284
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,160
noticed something like um specifically

1285
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,640
from it but I kind of like am I still

1286
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,879
have a lot of that kind of stuff you

1287
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:58,239
know like that I just didn't use

1288
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,519
so I'm still kind of like interested in

1289
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,519
revisiting it and like kind of isolating

1290
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:04,400
it a bit more and seeing like what it

1291
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:07,480
does so that's that's kind of something

1292
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,960
that I do uh just like messing around

1293
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,599
you know what I mean locco mentioned

1294
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,599
that like one of the things he watches

1295
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,760
out for is like end talks I was

1296
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:22,240
wondering if any of you in your current

1297
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:24,359
or previous setups had like how how

1298
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,558
would I put it kind of like a almost

1299
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:28,920
like a a sense of like what would be

1300
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,240
risks during flower or things that

1301
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,240
[Music]

1302
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,838
were how' I put it were the things you

1303
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:37,159
were watching out for that you were

1304
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:41,519
worried

1305
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:45,440
about um so I'll comment with the uh Jax

1306
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:48,159
321 um it's designed in like three to be

1307
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,159
applied in like you know like not

1308
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,679
applied in three parts but like it has a

1309
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,838
three separate parts that you mix

1310
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:57,239
together right

1311
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,400
and and and it has um calcium nitrate

1312
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:00,838
which is like

1313
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,240
1500 and then they have like their base

1314
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:07,078
b or whatever which is like the you know

1315
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:10,719
pottassium and phosphorus and then they

1316
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:13,160
have like a magnesium sulfate um but

1317
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,919
like I mean off the bat like you kind of

1318
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:16,960
know that some things aren't going to

1319
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,400
respond well because like you have such

1320
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,599
a high nitrogen

1321
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,960
content um and it sucks because like in

1322
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:27,039
that specific formula your nitrogen is

1323
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,679
tied with your calcium so it's not like

1324
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:32,760
you can cut back

1325
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:36,118
nitrogen and expect to keep the same

1326
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,839
like calcium content if that makes sense

1327
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,039
um but really that's kind of like the

1328
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,920
only formula that I've I've seen that

1329
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:44,160
issue

1330
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,720
specifically yeah I always try and look

1331
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,199
at like the potassium rates towards the

1332
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,798
end of flow um and just like the

1333
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:53,598
potassium rates in general for some

1334
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:54,960
lines are like absolutely insane and

1335
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,559
that's where you'll start seeing that

1336
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,720
that um yellow tipping on the The Leaf

1337
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,880
tips you know what I mean and that

1338
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:03,759
dieback I almost always see that with

1339
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,119
like an overuse of like a potassium

1340
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,359
heavy Bloom product and it can actually

1341
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:11,920
get bad enough on some of these like 30

1342
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:13,960
e recipes that um the Brack tips

1343
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,240
themselves on the flow start to get that

1344
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,400
same dback and um I see it more and more

1345
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:22,159
on Commercial flow these days and it's

1346
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,519
it just shows me that people are reading

1347
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:26,000
bottles and not like actually being good

1348
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:28,199
grow

1349
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,199
you

1350
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:36,078
know maybe now it's making me curious

1351
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:38,920
like have any of you experienced like

1352
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,920
major fuckups in this period before or

1353
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,079
has it largely been smooth

1354
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,639
sailing yeah I [ __ ] up a

1355
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:50,599
lot um JX gave me my Mo not like I'm not

1356
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:54,038
[ __ ] on the product whatsoever like

1357
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:55,960
it was totally like on my end um but

1358
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:59,760
like dude it gave me the most like

1359
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:02,838
inconsistent Health um relatively

1360
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:05,039
speaking um you know just because some

1361
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:06,920
things were so sensitive to the nitrogen

1362
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,280
that it's like once the damage is done

1363
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,680
like it that you it's not like you can

1364
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,839
fix it you know what I mean like it's

1365
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,558
still gonna have an overabundance of

1366
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:21,000
nitrogen

1367
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:23,079
um but yeah I don't know yeah I mean is

1368
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,760
that something oh you

1369
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:28,440
going U I was just going to say like the

1370
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,799
thing I think to keep in mind too is

1371
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,480
like when you're running a bunch of new

1372
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,599
plants like you don't know what they're

1373
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,039
going to do the first time you know so

1374
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,599
there's just like this element where

1375
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:44,559
like sometimes I was growing some

1376
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:49,440
pineapple or not pineapple some um pine

1377
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:53,240
tar Kush from Caleb from CSI and

1378
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,358
um I just noticed that like they were

1379
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,598
drinking really slow and then I started

1380
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:59,639
getting into this weird thing where I

1381
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:01,079
had nitrogen claw you know and it it's

1382
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:02,838
kind of like there's a certain point

1383
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,119
where you just got to leave it alone

1384
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:06,759
because the more it seems like the more

1385
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:09,480
you do the worse it's getting you know

1386
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,680
it's like sometimes you just got to be

1387
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,440
okay with like not knocking it out of

1388
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,118
the park and just you know maybe if you

1389
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,880
get an idea of it you get an idea of it

1390
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,880
if not try it again you know yeah and

1391
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,680
like a slight deficiency is way easier

1392
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,599
to deal with than like an overuse of

1393
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:27,078
something it's like you know what I mean

1394
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,119
like you can always add a little more to

1395
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,240
make it taste better but it's next to

1396
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,400
impossible to remove it cuz then like I

1397
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:36,118
did this one time I was using a um you

1398
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,000
guys know mad farmer I think they did

1399
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:43,079
make like the Moab powder and stuff um

1400
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,960
they had a trial like veg and Bloom

1401
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:49,480
powder line too and I was growing using

1402
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:52,079
like their you know exact um dilution

1403
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,480
rates and stuff and uh every time I

1404
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,480
mixed it it was like three 0 you know

1405
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,240
and I kept watering it in and I just saw

1406
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,000
the plants get worse and worse until I

1407
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,798
was like okay this is too much and then

1408
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,960
like being newer to Growing I was like

1409
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:06,400
oh well I saw this product at the grow

1410
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,639
shop and it's like a salt remover you

1411
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,960
know and it's supposed to help like

1412
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:11,400
rinse all these excess salts out and

1413
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,679
it's like at this point like yeah like

1414
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,798
er saying like you're you're kind of

1415
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:17,598
just like too far gone you know um it's

1416
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:19,599
not going to get better and adding more

1417
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,760
stuff to try and remove certain things

1418
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:25,640
is just like the exact opposite of what

1419
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,520
um you want and so the old adage that

1420
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:30,798
everyone used to say is like um use half

1421
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:33,960
as much as they say because like a

1422
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:36,400
growth chart for like uh different

1423
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,639
fertilizer usage like if I've got

1424
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,358
nitrogen on the Y AIS and then like

1425
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:44,358
plant growth on the X you're G to see

1426
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:45,719
this ma or I'm sorry opposite of that um

1427
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:50,000
plant growth on the Y you're G to see

1428
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:51,598
this massive increase in growth for um a

1429
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,798
certain point you know it's just this

1430
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,798
nice exponential growth curve and then

1431
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:59,239
at a certain point it plateaus for quite

1432
01:00:55,798 --> 01:01:01,159
a long time and then it starts dropping

1433
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:02,838
um and getting into you know like aect

1434
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:04,798
negatively affecting the yield for how

1435
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:06,759
much you're using and nutrient companies

1436
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,759
want to push you as far over to the

1437
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,359
right on that Plateau as they can where

1438
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,280
you're using abundantly more for the

1439
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,838
same exact effect and so like what

1440
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,760
people always used to recommend is just

1441
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,558
like start off with half and kind of go

1442
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,680
from there yeah I was kind of G to add

1443
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:24,160
kind of like the one thing I've noticed

1444
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:27,879
is there's no like benefit to feeding

1445
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:30,639
like over like two and a half Max I

1446
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,960
don't unless like your your system is

1447
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,920
like truly [ __ ] dialed in

1448
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,639
environmentally and you have like

1449
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,480
[ __ ] CO2 and an entirely sealed

1450
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,879
system and all that [ __ ] like yeah I

1451
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:48,240
don't know like it it's kind of

1452
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:50,200
irrelevant you know under some

1453
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,318
circumstances yeah and I feel like some

1454
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:54,159
of those stress responses from being far

1455
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,558
over on that like Plateau where you're

1456
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:57,679
just adding more and not getting

1457
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:00,039
response is where you kind of end up in

1458
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:02,838
like hermaphroditic territory and like

1459
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:04,839
just weird expressions in general yeah

1460
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:07,519
because I mean it is fair to say too

1461
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,880
that like you know it is stress on the

1462
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:13,318
plant I mean it is creating salt stress

1463
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,318
on the root res and stuff you

1464
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:18,920
know you also have to consider too like

1465
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,318
you know these dudes are like sh

1466
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:25,039
focusing on the [ __ ] like uh EC going

1467
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:28,318
in but like also the inmedia like the EC

1468
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:31,278
in the medium is like almost three times

1469
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,440
as much you know like I'm just like this

1470
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:36,679
cannot be [ __ ] healthy for the plant

1471
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:40,318
at all I don't know like the plant will

1472
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:43,318
like look you know big and and nice

1473
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:46,159
and whatnot like at a commercial scale

1474
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:50,038
but like there's just like I don't know

1475
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:50,038
it lacks character at the end of

1476
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:55,519
it well it's just like um you've you've

1477
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:57,038
heard heard like I mean I know I've

1478
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,119
heard like Matt and these guys talk

1479
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,480
about like quote unquote computer grown

1480
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,079
weed you

1481
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,798
know

1482
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,079
and I mean like when you have these like

1483
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:09,559
sensors and you're reading like dryback

1484
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:12,440
and like net monitoring I you know it's

1485
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:14,798
like there are these setups where that's

1486
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,400
happening and they're not necessarily

1487
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:19,038
producing

1488
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,240
like uh they're not always producing

1489
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,520
like the best weed or whatever you know

1490
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:28,239
so there's something else to it I think

1491
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:30,079
I mean yeah to me that's just about

1492
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,959
actually kind of a point that was made

1493
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,920
earlier like actually watching the plant

1494
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,838
and observing the plant and

1495
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,039
not not immediately assuming that like

1496
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:43,239
formalizing and automating and you know

1497
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:45,119
determining the process is immediately a

1498
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:47,439
good thing but it's just such a common

1499
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,358
impulse you know

1500
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,278
um one thing I did want to point out is

1501
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:55,920
that I like what farad Dan had to say

1502
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:58,079
about you know airing on the side of

1503
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:01,119
like a lighter feed than a heavier one

1504
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,640
because I think when you're analyzing

1505
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,358
risk one of the good parameters to look

1506
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:07,358
at is

1507
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,519
reversibility and like it reminds me of

1508
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,880
like watering as well you know for

1509
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:12,719
newbies it's like or on the side of

1510
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,680
watering less because it's easier to

1511
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,199
bounce back from that than watering too

1512
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:18,679
much you know and I like I kind of like

1513
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,919
some of those strategic principles

1514
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:23,159
because it's helpful for newer

1515
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,760
people yeah you learn their importance

1516
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:28,159
real quick after screwing up you know 12

1517
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,160
weeks of

1518
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:31,838
work you know then you're like oh I'm

1519
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,680
never going to forget that I'm going to

1520
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,358
water you know half as much or you know

1521
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:39,798
whatever it is water more or like less

1522
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:43,639
more frequently something like that you

1523
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:45,038
know I wanted to add no you go you go

1524
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:47,358
well I was just gonna say I know like

1525
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:50,079
there's so many products on the market

1526
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:53,558
to you know as for as far as nutrients

1527
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:56,599
and stuff like that goes and like you

1528
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:59,400
know I'm the kind of person that's like

1529
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:01,160
you know like I want to try the newest

1530
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,119
stuff and that kind of thing like I've

1531
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:05,078
always been you know like I have I want

1532
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,640
to get a nice computer or I want to get

1533
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:10,240
you know that kind of stuff and so um

1534
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,798
it's very easy to kind of go down that

1535
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:17,838
road but like it's it it was really eye

1536
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:20,480
opening to me uh when I went from using

1537
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,679
all these different inputs to using like

1538
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,960
literally a just straight up three-part

1539
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:28,798
General Hydro

1540
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:31,079
and some you know promix and all of

1541
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:32,960
these plants are coming out looking

1542
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:34,480
really nice and it's like what is

1543
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,240
happening right here it just is so it

1544
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,240
feels almost

1545
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:40,358
counterintuitive but I just wanted to

1546
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,519
say that because I do know that like as

1547
01:05:40,358 --> 01:05:46,278
a new grower it's so easy to just want

1548
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:48,679
to just add more more more you

1549
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:50,719
know yeah you think you're just like one

1550
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:51,838
additive away from hitting that three

1551
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,919
pounds of

1552
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:56,480
light yeah yeah or what whatever it is

1553
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,960
like you know you get obsessed on these

1554
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,719
things where people are like oh you got

1555
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:04,400
to use this you know Basalt lava Ash or

1556
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,318
whatever it is it's like I'm sure there

1557
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:11,480
are some really cool benefits from it

1558
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:12,838
but like you know are you are you like

1559
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,719
dialed in enough that you're gonna

1560
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:18,838
notice it even you know um so like one

1561
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:21,078
thing I've kind of noticed um is there's

1562
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:23,199
like this rule of thumb to pick like a

1563
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:26,798
nice kind of two two to three-part

1564
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:30,078
nutrient line and get to know that yeah

1565
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:32,038
um I don't know it because like you know

1566
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,079
trying so many different things yeah

1567
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:37,200
it's nice but like you don't really know

1568
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:39,760
how the product works until you like

1569
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,759
actually see it across the board and

1570
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:47,278
stuff like that but I don't know I've

1571
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:50,839
I've done maybe uh this is my third or

1572
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:54,760
fourth grow with Cana I think my third

1573
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:58,599
but I don't know like um

1574
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:02,079
yeah that that te part kind of rule is

1575
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:04,278
it's a nice one to follow yeah I like um

1576
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,798
for newer people I always recommend like

1577
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:07,960
like big ear was saying like the

1578
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:09,599
three-part or two even a two-part GH

1579
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,480
because they have like the Flora NOA

1580
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,960
which is kind of like the Sanic approach

1581
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,000
um and they have you know like some soy

1582
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,119
protein hydrolysate and probably like a

1583
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,719
little um seaweed extract in there and

1584
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,680
you can grow really great weed with

1585
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:27,439
florova grow bloom and like the GH Roots

1586
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:28,798
like you can make perfectly good weed

1587
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,599
with that and so it's a great place to

1588
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,278
start as far as just like it's super

1589
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:35,240
easy to learn and um you can start

1590
01:07:33,278 --> 01:07:36,880
slowly adding one thing at a time to

1591
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:40,000
that and see if it actually does make a

1592
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,000
difference once you have that

1593
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,559
Baseline yeah um it's kind of funny

1594
01:07:44,278 --> 01:07:48,960
because I feel like that that Lucas

1595
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,680
formula was like the best expression I

1596
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,119
was able to pull out of like the sweet

1597
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:59,038
pee yeah um I haven't really seen it

1598
01:07:54,119 --> 01:08:01,358
like that under Cana but I don't know um

1599
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,839
you kind of just notice that like some

1600
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:06,480
plants have their preferences in a way

1601
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:09,599
but I don't know that's that's not

1602
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,599
today's topic I

1603
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:18,838
guess um I wanted to spice things up a

1604
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:22,798
bit and do a little tangent on myths why

1605
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:22,798
don't we start with everyone's favorite

1606
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:30,759
Flushing who wants to pick up the knife

1607
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:33,199
first um so I mean I guess the way I see

1608
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:35,719
flushing is to like encourage lik in

1609
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:38,318
essence you know like I don't think it

1610
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:39,838
makes like the smoke any better but I

1611
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:45,000
just kind of want to make sure that the

1612
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:47,119
plants using what it already has um like

1613
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,279
I don't know in soil or something like

1614
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:52,439
soil for example that has like a higher

1615
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,319
Caton exchange capacity I've always

1616
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,119
thought you'd want to flush it a little

1617
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,839
longer like if wait wait wait before you

1618
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,519
go further like do you want to Define

1619
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:03,318
what you you call flushing first or like

1620
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,480
what you are

1621
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:08,359
describing um I mean I'm kind of just

1622
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,599
like using it to encourage

1623
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:12,319
syence like to kind of no sorry what's

1624
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,640
the actual process when you say flushing

1625
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:17,400
do you mean like you're holding off

1626
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,359
feeding oh I'm just like I'm just like

1627
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:24,399
watering it like with water

1628
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:27,640
yeah yeah um but yeah that's it nothing

1629
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:29,519
too special but like Coco I'll do like

1630
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:32,359
you know two three

1631
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,120
days but it's because like it doesn't

1632
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:37,159
hold on to nutrients as much as

1633
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:39,439
something like soil so it's easier to

1634
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:42,759
kind of strip those sites off and kind

1635
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:45,759
of encourage the essence a lot quicker

1636
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:47,399
yeah so I got um kind of obsessed with

1637
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,920
flushing at one point I think I've

1638
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:51,519
talked about this before and like kind

1639
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,319
of what led me to doing some like dwc

1640
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,719
type

1641
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,719
stuff um

1642
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,719
but uh I've done flushing in the way

1643
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,520
that local saying is the way that I

1644
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,760
would generally do it um but I have also

1645
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,640
taken like a five gallon pot and poured

1646
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,800
like 20 gallons of water through it in

1647
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,760
one

1648
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:15,520
shot you know what I mean those roots

1649
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,440
what I wanted to do yeah so I have done

1650
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,199
that uh and I've measured like the PPM

1651
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:22,519
and stuff of the runoff you know like

1652
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:25,319
all that stuff that you that you do that

1653
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:28,000
people do or maybe they don't I did it

1654
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:33,679
was it the cleanest smoke you ever

1655
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:37,279
had I mean white ash baby very white ash

1656
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,679
yes almost clear that's the thing that's

1657
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:42,238
weird about it is like you know I've had

1658
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,640
plants where like where how local

1659
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,919
approaches it just started like I I'll

1660
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,480
generally just stop watering for like

1661
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:54,199
the last like few days or not stop

1662
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:55,839
watering but stop feeding um and

1663
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:58,678
it's interesting because some plants

1664
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:02,079
will like change drastically and then

1665
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:05,760
some plants will like I had this mule

1666
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:07,840
Skinner uh from hin LOM that I ended up

1667
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,440
flushing with just plain water for like

1668
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:13,000
two weeks because I was just like what I

1669
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:16,479
just want to see what it's going to do

1670
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,960
um it just like never changed really um

1671
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:21,919
so I just haven't noticed like a huge

1672
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:25,079
difference in the quality of the smoke

1673
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:29,000
so um it's not something that I'm really

1674
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:32,399
obsessed about but I still do flush

1675
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,760
because um like I've also fed nutrients

1676
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,198
up until the very end and it did it also

1677
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,800
didn't like it didn't make it any better

1678
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,319
so I figure um if I can save on

1679
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,719
nutrients and get the same end product

1680
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:46,079
then I'll just do

1681
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:48,480
that yeah I do want to ask though like

1682
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,679
are we talking about a diff like are we

1683
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,599
talking about like two different things

1684
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:54,600
like is there flushing in the sense of

1685
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:59,039
like your running water through your

1686
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:01,000
root Zone to achieve some outcome versus

1687
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:02,519
you're holding off feeding what do you

1688
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,238
guys how do you guys see this

1689
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,719
distinction or this like ambiguity I

1690
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:10,439
kind of view it as like literally yeah I

1691
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:12,279
think it is like people in their mind

1692
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:14,719
mixing up like a few different things

1693
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:16,880
like I agree with ER that it's like the

1694
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:19,480
reason that I don't feed for that last

1695
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,760
week or two is because I'm cheap and

1696
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:23,238
like if the plants like not if it

1697
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:26,000
doesn't make it better then like why am

1698
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:27,919
I pay for fertilizer to go into the pot

1699
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,679
you know what I mean and I also want my

1700
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,840
soil to be a little bit more leeched and

1701
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,600
not heavy and nutrients especially Bloom

1702
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,079
NES like right once I throw because I

1703
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:40,000
reuse my soil I don't throw it away and

1704
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:42,399
so um I don't want it to be like super

1705
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,520
salt filled when I come back to it but

1706
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:48,039
it's like when I think about flushing

1707
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,239
it's like some people think that it's

1708
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:52,158
like increasing like it's like causing

1709
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:54,238
some physiological change in the plant

1710
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:56,519
that makes it better some people think

1711
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,119
that like fertilizer crystals within the

1712
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,800
plant make the smoke

1713
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:04,079
harsher um the way I kind of view it is

1714
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:07,239
like I'm cheap and

1715
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:10,960
um I feel like the Cure is honestly much

1716
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:13,559
more important than the flush as far as

1717
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,319
all the like evaluation goes on it you

1718
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,840
know and so like I've had stuff that was

1719
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:19,960
fed like from a seed production run that

1720
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,480
was fed full strength veg NES all the

1721
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:25,198
way through flour till the last day and

1722
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:27,198
it's a little bit harsher but it's not

1723
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:29,519
that bad you know what I mean it was

1724
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:31,839
perfectly smokable weed and it actually

1725
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,560
had kind of like some nice Aroma changes

1726
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,360
with that too with like high nitrogen

1727
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,760
feed all the way through and so like all

1728
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:39,639
these things that are like kind of

1729
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,800
General roles of thumb in the industry

1730
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:44,520
and like within the community are like

1731
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,880
not hard fast rules for everything you

1732
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,719
know like there is going to be some

1733
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,480
plants that are like perfectly fine with

1734
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:50,600
high Nitro or like salt all the way

1735
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:52,959
through the end and there's going to be

1736
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,440
some that don't and so it's kind of just

1737
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,760
about like dialing it in but I don't

1738
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,399
think flushing makes your Ash whiter I

1739
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:03,639
really don't I think it's just like

1740
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:05,920
stupid to even like consider it um I

1741
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:08,079
guess I'll I'll mention too like back in

1742
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,239
the day like when I was like an amateur

1743
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:13,439
at growing I would like flush my medium

1744
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:15,439
to like clear out any [ __ ] excess

1745
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:16,960
nutrients that I may have applied like

1746
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:20,719
that was a form of flushing that I've

1747
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,920
done yeah um but like it's not like I

1748
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:27,920
flush my medium entirely and then go

1749
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:30,239
back to feeding you know regularly um

1750
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,119
because like I kind of do it in a way

1751
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,039
where I don't let my medium dry out

1752
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:38,119
entirely too much where like salts

1753
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:40,840
builded up um so like in theory I don't

1754
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:43,119
have to like flush to like get rid of

1755
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,520
salt it's just like achieve some runoff

1756
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:49,238
and you'll kind of maintain an

1757
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:52,000
equilibrium this is a bit of a tangent

1758
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:54,519
but it's come up as a term um I think

1759
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:59,000
when I've listened to you uh local and

1760
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:00,679
Dan talk um what is the it's kind of

1761
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,679
related to what you just said right like

1762
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:04,920
what is the risk around like quotequote

1763
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:07,079
dryback or like benefits or like how do

1764
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:10,440
you see

1765
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:12,479
dryback I mean like I don't know in

1766
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:14,238
flower like I've kind of always been in

1767
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,359
practice to encourage a little more

1768
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,638
dryback than you would in veg kind of

1769
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:21,039
just to like encourage that like

1770
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:24,159
Winter's coming or whatever or like

1771
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:27,519
water's a little more restricted yeah

1772
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:30,119
exactly yeah yeah um but like with that

1773
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,840
like you kind of risk salt buildup

1774
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:35,039
because like as you like dry back your

1775
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,079
concentration or like your the amount of

1776
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,399
water to like salt is going to be thrown

1777
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:43,079
off and like you're going to have a

1778
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:45,559
concentration of salts in your medium um

1779
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:48,319
and really like the only way to like get

1780
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:50,440
that lower is by running water through

1781
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,319
it strip to strip the salts from The

1782
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:55,799
Medium but like I don't know it's it's

1783
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:58,039
never like been bad enough to where it

1784
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:02,159
like physically damages the plants to

1785
01:15:58,039 --> 01:16:03,920
what I can see um but yeah yeah I think

1786
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:05,679
this kind of just goes back to like what

1787
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,480
an was saying as far

1788
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:11,039
as kind of staying on like the lighter

1789
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,678
side of things um because I can just

1790
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,319
tell you from personal experience like

1791
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:17,719
when you're there pouring like 20

1792
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:20,759
gallons of water through a pot it

1793
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:23,679
doesn't feel good and you you're like

1794
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:28,000
you're like man this cannot good for

1795
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,039
this plan you know uh it's a lot and um

1796
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,359
it

1797
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:35,000
also in doing like taking like I I would

1798
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:36,880
do it I'd like do like a gallon and then

1799
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,319
do like a slurry test and see where I

1800
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,319
was and then go again you know what I

1801
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:43,719
mean and um it doesn't change it very

1802
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:48,079
much man it takes a lot of water to

1803
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:51,800
actually flush it you know um so I just

1804
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:53,439
think like yeah just maybe like try to

1805
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,360
not get into a position where where you

1806
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:58,000
feel like you need to flush

1807
01:16:55,359 --> 01:17:00,279
anyways um that's nice that you bring up

1808
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,840
the slurry test too Ern because like I

1809
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:03,559
find that a lot of people or a lot of

1810
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:07,000
newer Growers are like stuck on

1811
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:09,719
measuring the EC and pH of the runoff

1812
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,639
and like that runoff pH in theory like

1813
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:15,239
it's not going to be the same as the

1814
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:18,440
water going in or whatever or the uh the

1815
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:20,359
pH of the actual medium because like

1816
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:22,359
you're the plant's going to be feeding

1817
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:24,880
as that water is like coming out so like

1818
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:26,839
some ey on are going to be like missing

1819
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:30,639
making it either like more basic or

1820
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:34,000
acidic at least to my understanding um I

1821
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:37,000
don't know if if um anyone else is able

1822
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,840
to contribute to that but yeah they're

1823
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,639
they're not very accurate tests when

1824
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,520
you're testing runoff like it is not

1825
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:44,560
like an exact representation of what's

1826
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,800
going on in your pot and I think the

1827
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,840
easiest example like in Hydro like the

1828
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,440
more inert your media goes I feel like

1829
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,639
it is more applicable but especially in

1830
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:55,079
like a nice well Blended potting soil

1831
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:57,760
like I was talking about earlier with

1832
01:17:55,079 --> 01:18:01,079
like compost and you know a lot more

1833
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,280
organic portions to it that are that are

1834
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:05,600
like did do come pre fertilized like you

1835
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,679
can pour a cup of water through some

1836
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:11,000
fresh bags of soil like that and it'll

1837
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:13,880
come out at like 4 EC but like not all

1838
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,279
of that is like readily plant available

1839
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,639
and like you know what I mean um it's

1840
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:20,319
not an incredibly accurate test on its

1841
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:23,760
own

1842
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:26,238
um go ahead oh you can finish dud sorry

1843
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,639
about that oh yeah I'm just yeah just

1844
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:31,559
saying like your media really dictates

1845
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:35,199
like how accurate that is and I think

1846
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:37,199
cocoa and promix kind of style it um

1847
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:41,559
it's probably a little bit more accurate

1848
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:43,519
than like real soil um but in Hydro is

1849
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,400
kind of the only time that I really even

1850
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,880
use it as a tool besides kind of just

1851
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:50,198
like oh this is the general b ballpark

1852
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,000
that the pH is in like plus or minus

1853
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:54,519
like you know a few points and same with

1854
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,800
the EC like PR plus or minus a few

1855
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,800
hundred

1856
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:01,039
PPM I was just going to add an anecdote

1857
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,760
here which is that one of my most

1858
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:06,158
traumatic experiences as a new grower

1859
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,800
was like going down this bizarre Rabbit

1860
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,119
Hole probably wholly

1861
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:14,639
unnecessarily um of like freaking out

1862
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:18,319
freaking out about my um medium's

1863
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:20,359
pH um and just getting completely lost

1864
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,158
because I didn't know what I was doing

1865
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:25,039
um and actually I think I told ER about

1866
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:27,399
this and I actually ended up speaking to

1867
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:30,238
like a Cana person on the phone which is

1868
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:31,920
quite bizarre like I've never spoken to

1869
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,000
like anyone in this industry on the

1870
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,880
phone like as a you know like a customer

1871
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,880
before yeah yeah um and he actually had

1872
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,039
really good advice he was just like look

1873
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,119
if your medium there's something

1874
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,840
actually wrong with his pH or buffering

1875
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:48,519
capabilities you are not going to be

1876
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:50,800
able to fix it like at home like you

1877
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:54,639
won't even have the tools to like

1878
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:57,000
diagnose it properly um and I thought

1879
01:19:54,639 --> 01:19:59,359
that was actually quite good

1880
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,800
advice yeah that's what something like

1881
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:04,679
when I was still doing the quote unquote

1882
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:09,079
like you know living soil or organic

1883
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:13,119
kind of stuff um I I was using uh my

1884
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:15,760
soil like multiple runs you know and um

1885
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:18,559
we have like an agricultural University

1886
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,239
near us so I took it and was getting

1887
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,920
some like soil tested and stuff like

1888
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:26,718
that just to see and like through that

1889
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,560
whole process I just I just like really

1890
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,000
realized that

1891
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,000
like a lot of the things that you're

1892
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,600
like really stressing about you really

1893
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,800
just it's so hard to control them that

1894
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,159
uh you're better off to just like get

1895
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,880
products that are going to put you on

1896
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:46,879
the right path from the very

1897
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:49,600
beginning yeah like I had a in my foray

1898
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,119
and like Organics U I feel like Organics

1899
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,960
is where you actually do have to

1900
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:55,639
slightly pay more attention to this

1901
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:58,359
because some of the organic inputs do

1902
01:20:55,639 --> 01:21:01,440
have their own wild pH swings like and

1903
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:05,000
the main one I'm thinking of is uh a

1904
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:07,359
little bit farther back like in the 201s

1905
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,760
up until legalization people were all

1906
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:12,839
about seabird guano and bat guano and

1907
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,440
the seabird guano specifically like

1908
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,679
they're harvesting it off of these like

1909
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:18,359
little ocean rocks you know what I mean

1910
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:20,760
those little rocky outcroppings that are

1911
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:24,679
just covered in crap and like what's

1912
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:26,520
also in it is tons of um like shell from

1913
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:28,480
eggs like all kinds of different little

1914
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,159
products byproducts and so what I

1915
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,839
noticed with that stuff is that it's

1916
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:34,559
super super basic and when I was top

1917
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:37,159
dressing with like the

1918
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,880
teaspoon um for like a three gallon pot

1919
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:44,399
or whatever after a few weeks my runoff

1920
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,520
was like a pH of 10 and it was like way

1921
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:50,079
out of whack because that seabird guano

1922
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:52,480
was just like very very um basic in its

1923
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:56,079
own natural component you know based on

1924
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:59,000
it it's a composition and so um with

1925
01:21:56,079 --> 01:22:00,920
normal like liquid bottled nutrients

1926
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,479
like you're usually watering in between

1927
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:06,239
like 5'8 and 65 by like design because

1928
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:08,158
it's like usually naturally buffered by

1929
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:11,559
the way they've designed it and so if

1930
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:14,158
you're not inputting anything that has a

1931
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:17,960
crazy pH swing then like you shouldn't

1932
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:20,198
have an issue going forward at

1933
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,760
all yeah that's more or less what he

1934
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:23,198
said he was just like if you have the

1935
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,960
right product it's going to be

1936
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,399
adequately buffered and like you

1937
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,840
shouldn't really have to worry about it

1938
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:32,879
like on this scale you know on this

1939
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:36,840
level um

1940
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:38,239
yeah well I don't know if you have

1941
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,400
anything else to say around this

1942
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:42,599
flashing topic I wanted to move it along

1943
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:45,799
towards like any other weird myths that

1944
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:48,800
yall have heard about flowering like I

1945
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,400
know that some people are like I'll just

1946
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,159
say that like one one pet one for me is

1947
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:55,799
people who think that like basically

1948
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:57,960
like abusing the [ __ ] out of your plant

1949
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,719
like driving a steak through like the

1950
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,800
stem or like super Crossing or any of

1951
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,319
those things are beneficial and not I'm

1952
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,639
not going to say that they're not like I

1953
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:09,479
just don't know but I'm curious about

1954
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:11,719
you you know everyone's thoughts on

1955
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:14,119
stuff like

1956
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:15,840
this I think like the most that I've

1957
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:17,519
really kind of like messed around with

1958
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,400
is like cold

1959
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:24,040
stress you know um like early on just

1960
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:26,759
kind of like I I don't know like I it'll

1961
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:28,880
get really cold outside and I'll like

1962
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:33,560
sometimes like just vent cold air into

1963
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:35,159
my tents um I still do that sometimes

1964
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:40,880
you know

1965
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:44,599
um and I think that it kind of tends

1966
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,119
to I I don't know I it may be like a Bro

1967
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,360
Science thing but it kind of tends to

1968
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:49,920
make them look a little bit like

1969
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:51,679
frostier and that kind of thing like I

1970
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,079
just feel like around like when you can

1971
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:56,960
get like cold Su like really cold dry

1972
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:59,479
air the plants just like kind of react

1973
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,480
to it a bit but I've you know in the

1974
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:05,319
cold stress thing too I've also seen

1975
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:06,959
like people taking like ice and putting

1976
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:08,960
it in their you know putting it on top

1977
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,880
of their soil and like watering over it

1978
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,840
and stuff like

1979
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:17,159
that yeah trying to force that purple

1980
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:19,440
man yeah yeah it when I was when I was

1981
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:21,439
like starting out um I I just didn't

1982
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,000
really understand a lot of this stuff so

1983
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:26,599
like you know purple weed was pretty and

1984
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,198
that's cool or whatever you know now

1985
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:32,280
it's just not something that I'm I'm

1986
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:34,638
really concerned with my favorite one is

1987
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:36,399
when uh if you ever go to a hydro shop

1988
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,600
they they're not common anymore but

1989
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:39,079
especially the shops that have been

1990
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,159
around a lot they just have this [ __ ]

1991
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:43,800
left over from years ago but um there's

1992
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,079
all these white bottles with like

1993
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,199
different pictures of fruit on them and

1994
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:51,279
they're all like artificially

1995
01:24:48,198 --> 01:24:52,719
flavored um like sugar supplements you

1996
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,719
know what I mean and like they were

1997
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,118
everywhere for a long time and like

1998
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,800
they'll just have a picture of a grape

1999
01:24:56,118 --> 01:24:59,519
on it and it smells like artificial

2000
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,760
grape cuz that's obviously how you make

2001
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,800
grape Aromas and weed is by like pouring

2002
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,800
artificial grape flavoring and sugar

2003
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,400
into your into your med and these are

2004
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,000
from like professional companies like

2005
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:11,879
Botanicare and [ __ ] you know and it was

2006
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,479
just like a thing for a long time and

2007
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,239
I'm sure that they knew it was [ __ ]

2008
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:17,479
when they were Mass producing this but

2009
01:25:15,238 --> 01:25:19,799
it's a it's one of those like old

2010
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:21,279
vestages that I just always laugh about

2011
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,639
in this

2012
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:27,238
industry yeah I I had a person tell me

2013
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:29,719
sorry just about the fruit thing I that

2014
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:31,759
you could put put your buds like when

2015
01:25:29,719 --> 01:25:34,118
you were drying them like have them on a

2016
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,119
rack and then have like fruit underneath

2017
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:40,399
of it and like a flame a fan like

2018
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:42,039
blowing across the fruit onto the buds

2019
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:45,559
someone told me that's how I should be

2020
01:25:42,039 --> 01:25:48,359
drying it I'm not kidding ethene

2021
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:50,840
baby it's it's pretty nuts how many

2022
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:53,559
[ __ ] like old W tales that there are

2023
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,239
in this this community Community yeah

2024
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,159
like hang your plants upside down while

2025
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:59,718
you're drying because it it concentrates

2026
01:25:57,158 --> 01:26:02,839
the THC in the buds that one was a good

2027
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:06,600
one that's an amazing one that shoulding

2028
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:10,000
the Hall of Fame of myths it's so good

2029
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:12,159
yeah or was one Matt said one time like

2030
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,840
shock the plants with like a car

2031
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:17,799
battery bro I me you got a shotg to turn

2032
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,639
them purple I think for me it's more of

2033
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,760
like a psychological or I don't know

2034
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:23,560
cultural interest that I have in this

2035
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,480
kind of General strategy of like if

2036
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,520
you're violent towards your plant and if

2037
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:31,079
you traumatize it it's good yeah and I'm

2038
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,840
like why though this makes me think I

2039
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:37,118
was I was reading some kids uh um

2040
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,920
Master's thesis out of San lispo and in

2041
01:26:37,118 --> 01:26:41,679
it's about like reversal Tech and like

2042
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:44,199
triing out a bunch of sprays and um in

2043
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:46,840
it he like has this full paragraph about

2044
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:49,039
like s's rization technique like it's

2045
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,920
like this like you know industry

2046
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:52,639
accepted method you know what I mean and

2047
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:54,359
I just love that that appears in a

2048
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,000
master's thesis and I remember like

2049
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:57,319
screencapping that and sending it to

2050
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,639
Matt and I'm just like look at this

2051
01:26:57,319 --> 01:27:02,319
[ __ ] dude wait you have to you have

2052
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:04,118
to elaborate what that is calization is

2053
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,079
just like torturing your plant through

2054
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:08,679
like drought stress and heat and like

2055
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,719
keeping a giant plant in a Solo Cup and

2056
01:27:08,679 --> 01:27:13,920
like just stressing it in every way

2057
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:16,439
imaginable to like get it to Herm and it

2058
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,480
like I guess it works on some things but

2059
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:20,759
it's just like if you think about like

2060
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,519
the EP potential epigenetic costs of

2061
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,840
that like I don't know it's not like a

2062
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:29,040
proven thing but um I just can't imagine

2063
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:31,639
that like stressed plants produce the

2064
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,079
best possible Offspring I hope these

2065
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:36,960
people on

2066
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:38,719
parents yeah right yeah just snack my

2067
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,880
around a little bit makes them

2068
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,239
strong yeah it's like go you know go

2069
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,440
play on the train tracks it'll help

2070
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:48,559
build character kind of thing um yeah

2071
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:51,118
that's last Generations game like yeah

2072
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:54,119
yeah

2073
01:27:51,118 --> 01:27:54,118
yeah

2074
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:59,359
any other like weird myths that you all

2075
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:01,239
can think of um apart from like so we

2076
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,359
mentioned additives various kinds of

2077
01:28:01,238 --> 01:28:05,759
like

2078
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:08,118
stress oh yeah um some people do like uh

2079
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,000
I've heard people talk about um like

2080
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:14,238
doing like a dark period before

2081
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,279
flowering to like help trigger flowering

2082
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:18,678
yeah that was a good one yeah yeah it's

2083
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:20,118
like 24 hours dark on flip I remember

2084
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:23,079
that one from when I first started

2085
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:24,719
growing yeah I remember dude I mean you

2086
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:26,760
can get on Reddit and there are just

2087
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,399
threads dedicated to this oh yeah you

2088
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:32,440
know I go there and I just destroy them

2089
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:36,319
yeah cuz it's you know I mean yeah all

2090
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:38,238
sorts of things like that also the 28 or

2091
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:41,279
I've heard people doing 48 hours with

2092
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:44,158
two days no lights before flower it's

2093
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:46,840
weird I don't know I've actually noticed

2094
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:49,920
that that technique can help to some

2095
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:52,199
degree with um different reversal sprays

2096
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,520
too and the amount of phytotoxicity

2097
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:57,599
experience and then also just like its

2098
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:00,119
efficacy is that um I think that there's

2099
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,400
some interplay with

2100
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:05,198
um light intensity and like the plant

2101
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:06,799
breaking down the silver ions that

2102
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,559
you're spraying on it and like I don't

2103
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,719
have like proof it's all kind of

2104
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,840
anecdotal um it could also just be like

2105
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:16,840
hormone play and like the newest portion

2106
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:18,600
of the plant is um like has a different

2107
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:20,520
set of hormones doesn't have that

2108
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,480
concentration of silver on it from the

2109
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,480
last sprays and so it rever HS back to

2110
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:26,118
female first but it's just something

2111
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:29,519
I've noticed is that the lowers on

2112
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:32,039
Plants tend to stay um a little more

2113
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,719
reversed than the tops do and so I have

2114
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:36,560
a little experiment in mind of like

2115
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:38,399
under lighting and not top lighting and

2116
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,760
and seeing if that has like any effect

2117
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:43,839
on that but just a little side tangent

2118
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,119
yeah I mean that makes sense too I mean

2119
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,480
because you know I mean a lot of those

2120
01:29:46,118 --> 01:29:51,399
things um break you know have some kind

2121
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:53,158
of like decay in light so it very well

2122
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:56,158
could be that

2123
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:58,599
well maybe we can step away from the old

2124
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:01,439
wives tales and myths and kind of come

2125
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:03,440
back to you know the earnest side of

2126
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:05,359
flowering and anything else that we may

2127
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,919
have missed out

2128
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:12,639
um what about if we think

2129
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:15,000
towards like late flower does anything

2130
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,239
change or is it like even more hands-off

2131
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,039
than the rest of it because for me

2132
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:20,839
generally it is right I'm sure for most

2133
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:22,840
people it's like you're just watching

2134
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,079
waiting

2135
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:28,600
yeah I mean I'm still just kind of um

2136
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:31,760
I'm paying attention probably like the

2137
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:33,560
most I am to the humidity uh around that

2138
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:36,520
time you know around the like end of

2139
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:39,719
flower and stuff and I'm also I will

2140
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:42,560
also tend to like lower my lights just a

2141
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:44,359
little bit um like at the start of

2142
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,560
flower I'll I'll be somewhere around

2143
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:49,000
like 80 to

2144
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:51,600
85% and I'll get up to about like 90

2145
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,840
95% and then I'll work my way back down

2146
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,639
to around like 80% for the last like

2147
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,800
week you know just kind of give them a

2148
01:30:55,639 --> 01:31:00,400
break let them chill out do their thing

2149
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:02,520
whatever yeah I do the same thing with

2150
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:04,238
oh sorry loal but I do the same thing

2151
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,880
and I just kind of scale back the

2152
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:09,519
nutrients slowly from like week six to

2153
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,719
nine yeah and I'm talk like 300 parts

2154
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,920
per million increments and I do the same

2155
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:15,359
thing with the lighting where I kind of

2156
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:18,000
slowly ramp it back down from that

2157
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:21,359
Peak yeah I was just going to add those

2158
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,840
last two weeks um I'll like I won't feed

2159
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,759
every watering but I'll like supplement

2160
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,920
just like a little bit of plain water

2161
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:31,000
kind of just to you know cuz they're

2162
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,719
they they don't really need to eat that

2163
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,198
much but it's kind of just to feed them

2164
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,279
a little bit kind of get rid of some of

2165
01:31:36,198 --> 01:31:43,439
that food you

2166
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:45,399
know um but yeah nothing too crazy um

2167
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,879
and then I guess I did want to comment

2168
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:52,279
earlier on like the old wives tail um is

2169
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:55,920
there like there's no like kind of uh

2170
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:58,639
one kind of kir all product like Cal Mag

2171
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,639
for example I know a lot of people like

2172
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,960
recommend that for everything and it's

2173
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,639
just

2174
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:07,679
like I don't know just take information

2175
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:12,600
with the grain of salt I

2176
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:16,158
guess yeah C mag for president baby

2177
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:18,880
2024 I think I made that Meme years

2178
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:22,638
ago how often have you all encountered

2179
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:25,520
like btis um a lot flower I've I've had

2180
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:27,279
it you know a few times in my in my time

2181
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,960
and I remember the very first time it

2182
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:32,399
was like I was so devastated that first

2183
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,639
time it was like you know Christmas was

2184
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:35,960
ruined but then over time I'm like I've

2185
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:37,880
become a little bit more like

2186
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:39,760
desensitized to it I'm like okay cool I

2187
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,199
I've lost like a couple of tops like

2188
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,079
whatever but yeah for my personal

2189
01:32:42,198 --> 01:32:45,960
growing I've never had like too much an

2190
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:48,719
issue with it with like some of my like

2191
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,319
very first Blue Dream crops like the

2192
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,679
more I would knock it out of the park

2193
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:55,639
the worse the betrus would be cuz like

2194
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:57,840
we just didn't have the humidity control

2195
01:32:55,639 --> 01:32:59,600
for end oflow out on the coast it was

2196
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:03,440
always at like you know

2197
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:07,840
80% um but I've lost when I was up in

2198
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:11,359
Oregon I lost like a field to Bettis oh

2199
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:13,679
and it's it's devastating you know what

2200
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:16,238
I mean it's kind of funny that you bring

2201
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,319
up the Blue Dream because um I actually

2202
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,079
had one Santa Cruz wreck it was the

2203
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:23,479
number three um that I had never uh

2204
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:25,920
finished flowering it out cuz it it

2205
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:27,839
showed signs of betrus early and I was

2206
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,760
it was a crowded tent and I was like you

2207
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,960
know what like it's just best to kind of

2208
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,199
cut this thing down and not let it get

2209
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:40,840
to the rest but yeah I mean that's kind

2210
01:33:36,198 --> 01:33:43,000
of I mean if it's one plant um in an

2211
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,880
entire tent and you don't want to

2212
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,238
sacrifice it like yeah I mean yeah

2213
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,000
especially if like you're you're

2214
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:51,519
Outdoors like that's when it's like

2215
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,960
you're at the mercy of the weather you

2216
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,440
you know what I mean and so like that

2217
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,039
year I lost that field it started

2218
01:33:54,439 --> 01:33:59,319
raining September 1st and it didn't stop

2219
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:01,960
for about six weeks and then the end of

2220
01:33:59,319 --> 01:34:04,519
October was like gorgeous you know just

2221
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:07,399
to like rub it in a little bit you know

2222
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,880
and so uh you can once it starts it's

2223
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:11,279
not going to get better there's not a

2224
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:13,679
single product that you can spray to

2225
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:16,079
stop betrus once it's actually going and

2226
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:19,639
a lot of betrus itself is actually like

2227
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:22,198
a hodgepodge of a few different fungi

2228
01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:24,118
and so um and they're all like not

2229
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:26,399
treatable and so it's usually time to

2230
01:34:24,118 --> 01:34:28,839
cut it down the other thing I've noticed

2231
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:31,118
too with petritis is a lot of times like

2232
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,719
the bud can look fine on the outside but

2233
01:34:31,118 --> 01:34:37,639
like the inside is where it's [ __ ] up

2234
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:39,158
bro yeah and that's why like um your IPM

2235
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:41,920
going into flower like we were talking

2236
01:34:39,158 --> 01:34:43,679
earlier is super important because even

2237
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,279
if you do have something that you don't

2238
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,760
mind spraying partway through flow

2239
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:50,039
that's like a little more inert like an

2240
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,239
enzyme spray or something it's not going

2241
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:54,000
to get into those internal crevices of a

2242
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:55,919
flower and that's where those mold

2243
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,079
spores because like betrus is like a

2244
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,319
metropolitan fungi is what they call it

2245
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:03,039
it is in the Airstream like all over the

2246
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:05,559
world and so like it's all about just

2247
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:08,439
like not creating conditions for it and

2248
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:10,840
so your IPM early on is going to dictate

2249
01:35:08,439 --> 01:35:13,158
whether it's going to be a big problem

2250
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:16,639
for you later because um a few early

2251
01:35:13,158 --> 01:35:18,399
sulfur sprays to kill those um mold

2252
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:20,920
spores off and kind of inhibit them

2253
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:24,479
early on can go pretty far later on

2254
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:26,800
which is saving you a whole world of

2255
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,799
hurt yeah I was going to say to locco

2256
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,560
like you know you build up you build up

2257
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,719
that like fear of seeing those like

2258
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:37,600
Twisted little leaves and stuff you know

2259
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:39,639
yeah yeah I just never really I I I've

2260
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:43,840
had it on my like the outdoor plants

2261
01:35:39,639 --> 01:35:46,279
here but I've not had it inside um I say

2262
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,760
pretty on top of it or I try to like

2263
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:50,759
between runs I you know I take

2264
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,800
everything out and you know clean it

2265
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,600
with like hot bleach water and stuff

2266
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:58,119
like that like you know I really do just

2267
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,960
I just try to like focus on keeping my

2268
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:03,880
grow environment just like fairly clean

2269
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:07,118
generally speaking and that seems like

2270
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:09,359
it helps for me yeah that is huge like

2271
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:12,359
some zerotol sprays or like peroxy

2272
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:14,799
acetic acid with bleach um or even just

2273
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:17,039
bleach bleach is great um I got to the

2274
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,400
point um when I was at like a slightly

2275
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:22,039
smaller commercial scale where I would

2276
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:24,439
literally atomize the entire room with

2277
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:26,118
zerol and bleach waterer and like I'm

2278
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:28,238
hitting the lights I'm hitting the

2279
01:36:26,118 --> 01:36:32,079
tables I'm hitting the walls and ceiling

2280
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:34,559
like a good reset and keeping clean all

2281
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:35,719
the way through is a really big for the

2282
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,119
fungi

2283
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:42,560
problems yeah yeah I mean I when you

2284
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:44,158
guys were talking about IPM like I it's

2285
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,400
I it's not the best thing to say but I

2286
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:48,479
don't do a ton of IPM because I just

2287
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:50,599
really stay on top of that stuff and

2288
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,519
like I just haven't seen those issues

2289
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:55,679
you know if I do see something obviously

2290
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:57,480
I'll address it but like since my very

2291
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,639
first like the very first video I had I

2292
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:03,879
got spider mes uh from a

2293
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:05,600
friend and then otherwise that was such

2294
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:07,480
a terrible experience that I was just

2295
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,360
like I'm gonna stay on top of this you

2296
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:12,678
know what I mean I was I was just like

2297
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:15,359
really upset to like lose I didn't

2298
01:37:12,679 --> 01:37:16,960
really lose but I just felt like I could

2299
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:19,079
have done so much better and all these

2300
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,560
things I was like I just need to stay on

2301
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:25,519
top yeah like keep your system closed

2302
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:27,480
loop the more you intake um the more you

2303
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,520
intake stuff from outside like just the

2304
01:37:27,479 --> 01:37:31,479
higher chances you're going to get bugs

2305
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,400
and so like if you don't clone trade and

2306
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:35,479
you just pop seeds and stuff the chances

2307
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:38,158
of you having anything but like a little

2308
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:40,559
bit of Attis on your biggest buds is

2309
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,279
like pretty low and so uh you can keep

2310
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,480
on top of it a lot easier and so I

2311
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:47,279
advise against clone trading for the

2312
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:49,079
most part and also too like if you have

2313
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:51,439
some even if you just have like one or

2314
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:53,439
two plants outside like when you come

2315
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,079
inside wash your hands you know stuff

2316
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:58,559
like that like it's just just like

2317
01:37:56,079 --> 01:38:02,198
things that are uh pretty common sense

2318
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:04,239
but um they can definitely go a long way

2319
01:38:02,198 --> 01:38:06,638
yeah and I guess to like a lot of the

2320
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:09,479
new Growers like it's never too late to

2321
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:11,039
start like an IPM like you're better off

2322
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:14,638
starting off

2323
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,960
earlier um but yeah yeah yeah before

2324
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,960
there's a

2325
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:24,960
problem um so just just little note Dan

2326
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:27,399
do you have to go Dan I'm trick or treat

2327
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,480
duties yeah yeah I gotta go take my boy

2328

2329
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:33,198
that he can kind of understand what's

2330
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,960
happening you know we don't want to mess

2331
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:38,799
with that yeah should we B you a for now

2332
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:40,439
and then uh three of us can wrap up um

2333
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,119
yeah yeah no that's awesome like thank

2334
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:44,519

01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,440
bullshitting with the boys and so um

2337
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:49,479
thanks for saving the last three

2338
01:38:48,439 --> 01:38:52,439
recordings

2339
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:54,319
buddy yeah no worries man my wife is a

2340

little uh she's like are you done yet

2341
01:38:54,319 --> 01:39:00,840
and I'm like uh we got one more coming

2342
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:04,079
up so yeah but I will I will see you all

2343
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:07,119
again for this uh this Z sherb episode

2344
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,800
that we keep alluding to I'll try to

2345
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:10,920
give you a week off next week and then

2346
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,639
we'll come back to it yeah yeah yeah for

2347
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:15,639
sure well thank you

2348
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:17,719
guys I'll see you later later have a

2349
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:19,480
good time well I guess for us it's just

2350
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:21,359
like rounding this out now I mean is

2351
01:39:19,479 --> 01:39:24,799
they is there like anything else that

2352
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:28,920
youall want to say about flowering or

2353
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,279
like um maybe uh is it worth talking

2354
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:33,599
about your last whether you last

2355
01:39:30,279 --> 01:39:37,158
flowered anything interesting to

2356
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:41,960
highlight um I guess uh the one thing to

2357
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:44,439
highlight is like a lot of these um uh

2358
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:46,480
bottled formulas or powdered formulas

2359
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:50,158
whatever it maybe

2360
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:52,678
um a lot of those are like not design

2361
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:56,118
but like they're adver Iz for like nine

2362
01:39:52,679 --> 01:40:00,560
nine wheat crops right so like when

2363
01:39:56,118 --> 01:40:03,118
you're um growing like longer flowering

2364
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,520
like this is a good one plants like I

2365
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:06,759
don't know you kind of just want to

2366
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,679
prolong those periods by like an extra

2367
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:10,639
week or two if that makes sense like

2368
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:13,199
just to compensate for any of the extra

2369
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:15,319
weeks like that's kind of what I've I've

2370
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:18,559
done um and it's helped

2371
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:21,359
me um but yeah I don't know that's just

2372
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,159
kind of one thing that's that's probably

2373
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:24,359
where it's good to have some basic

2374
01:40:23,158 --> 01:40:25,759
understanding of like the distinct

2375
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:29,920
stages right so at least you can

2376
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:33,480
translate like the time frames

2377
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:36,158
um yeah yeah and like I've said like my

2378
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:38,319
issues mainly been like a potassium

2379
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:42,279
deficiency like towards like the end of

2380
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:44,599
flower and I mean now I know next time

2381
01:40:42,279 --> 01:40:46,960
it it's just to kind of supplement a

2382
01:40:44,599 --> 01:40:49,920
little extra potassium just to kind of

2383
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:52,800
keep the plant covered up until

2384
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:56,480
then

2385
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:58,560
but yeah that's really it like I by no

2386
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,319
means am I an expert on like feeding

2387
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:04,360
plants at all like none of my plants

2388
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:06,799
look 100% happy by any means but yeah

2389
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:08,799
yeah absolutely I mean it's it's

2390
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,239
definitely I think that's the biggest

2391
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,760
thing that I would try to impress on

2392
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:15,559
people is that it's there's you know

2393
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,079
like you're you're gonna get to a place

2394
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:19,800
where you're growing stuff that you're

2395
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:21,359
happy with but you're probably always

2396
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:23,239
going to feel like you can make your

2397
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:27,559
plants look

2398
01:41:23,238 --> 01:41:30,359
better you know I mean yep and

2399
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:32,239
so they're just you just have to find

2400
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:36,000
that place that's like a comfortable

2401
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:38,039
medium for you I think yeah and I you

2402
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,158
know I I said this the last time but I

2403
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:42,599
didn't qualify it for this recording but

2404
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:44,439
like one of the reasons why I've chosen

2405
01:41:42,599 --> 01:41:47,719
the three of you is because there's a

2406
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:49,079
really nice spread of like experience

2407
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:50,639
you know we have ER who's a bit newer

2408
01:41:49,079 --> 01:41:52,719
growing for a couple of years local

2409
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:55,359
Maybe maybe like what a decade local or

2410
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:59,480
more slightly more no no no no no not

2411
01:41:55,359 --> 01:42:02,479
not a decade just yet no um seven years

2412
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:04,638
at Max I want to say seven years okay

2413
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:08,919
okay and then Dan you know with like I

2414
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:12,039
think about 15 if I that would have had

2415
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:15,000
me growing at the age of

2416
01:42:12,039 --> 01:42:17,719
15 well Dan sat when he was 17 when did

2417
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,479
you start uh it started when I was

2418
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:22,719
18 that's early man that's still really

2419
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:24,759
early but I think my point was also that

2420
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,198
like one we have a spread of experiences

2421
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:27,400
just to like you know showcase that

2422
01:42:26,198 --> 01:42:29,839
because I think that's good information

2423
01:42:27,399 --> 01:42:31,759
and of itself but also like Ern said

2424
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,840
like no matter where you are there's

2425
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,280
always something that like you could

2426
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:37,000
improve still like I don't think anyone

2427
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,719
you at any point is like yeah it's

2428
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,719
perfect all the

2429
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:47,199
time yeah and I just like also want to

2430
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,079
say each plant's like a new adventure

2431
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:51,238
like every seed you pop like you're

2432
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:52,760
never gonna know until you like flower

2433
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:55,839
it

2434
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,920
so exactly exactly I don't know like

2435
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,639
some things like to take care of

2436
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:02,319
themselves and that's like always a

2437
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:04,800
[ __ ] bonus but then there are those

2438
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:07,198
instances where there's just you know

2439
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:10,199
some parents just aren't the happiest

2440
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:12,879
parents you know what I mean like so

2441
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:14,839
some of the off Offspring might like

2442
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:20,000
express some of those like sensitive

2443
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:22,039
traits or you know stuff like that but

2444
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,279
yeah I don't know yeah you're right you

2445
01:43:22,039 --> 01:43:24,560
may as well kind of treat it like every

2446
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:27,759
time you grow something new it's like a

2447
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:29,880
new game almost um you have some of the

2448
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,360
of course your Baseline like protocols

2449
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:34,480
but apart from that it's like you're

2450
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:37,198
just going to have to react slash like

2451
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:39,238
rerun yeah and it was pretty cool too

2452
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:42,118
I'll say like popping like the eveve

2453
01:43:39,238 --> 01:43:45,158
appy and like all the Santa Cruz wck too

2454
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:47,238
like each like individual has its

2455
01:43:45,158 --> 01:43:51,679
different needs and like that's just an

2456
01:43:47,238 --> 01:43:53,000
entire different game on its own like

2457
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:54,960
you know and they're they're from the

2458
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,840
same like parents you know and like

2459
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:58,679
you'll have some that like take care of

2460
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:01,159
themselves some that need a little more

2461
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:04,158
babying than others you know this and

2462
01:44:01,158 --> 01:44:08,000
that but yeah I know ER wanted to say

2463
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:12,799
something but sorry about that oh no

2464
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:15,520
you're good dude no I uh I think you

2465
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:17,400
kind of covered it mostly I think I

2466
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,840
think something that I would say is like

2467
01:44:17,399 --> 01:44:22,479
maybe I don't hear a lot of people talk

2468
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,840
about that they sometimes have plants

2469
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:29,238
that just don't look good for them you

2470
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:31,520
know um and it's okay if you if you run

2471
01:44:29,238 --> 01:44:34,359
something and you just don't like it you

2472
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,639
know I think like we really like talk

2473
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:38,399
about keeping stuff around a lot and

2474
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:41,239
learning stuff and stuff like that but

2475
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:44,879
like there can come a time

2476
01:44:41,238 --> 01:44:46,198
where uh you know sometimes like you

2477
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,560
just don't have to force it you know

2478
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:49,039
just like have a good time just like

2479
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:51,679
remember why you started growing that

2480
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:53,279
kind of stuff I I'm very much about that

2481
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:56,399
you know like I want there to be good

2482
01:44:53,279 --> 01:44:56,399
vibes and that kind of

2483
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:02,399
stuff absolutely I think that's a nice

2484
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:05,320
sentiment for

2485
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:07,359
sure if I mean anything else guys if not

2486
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:08,840

2487
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:11,439

and letting us like also run the show um

2524
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:41,839
I think it's also for him like a nice

2525
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,279
thing I think he's he has wanted to get

2526
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,760
to the point where he could trust other

2527
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:48,158
people to like handle the show if if

2528
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:50,199
he's busy um so I think he's also really

2529
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:52,638
stoked about you know where this is all

2530
01:46:50,198 --> 01:46:54,879
heading Ed um but I'm sure we will

2531
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:57,960
welcome him back very

2532
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:00,159
soon um apart from that I just want to

2533
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:03,639
say that like Dan mentioned we are

2534
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:05,319
lining up a skills episode as we've said

2535
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:07,520
um just takes a little bit more prep

2536
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:08,960
because we want Dan has a few questions

2537
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,400
that he wants

2538
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:14,880
to um get sent to CSI so Matt's going to

2539
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:17,238
facilitate some questions to Caleb that

2540
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,639
will be part of the show Lo will join us

2541
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:23,359
as well um and we'll talk about uh some

2542
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:26,239
of the uh hunting that he's doing

2543
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:29,399
through some sure best ones apart from

2544
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:32,959
that we've also probably got a harvest

2545
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:34,039
and post Harvest episode uh coming up

2546
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,880
initially I thought this was just for

2547
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:38,279
the outdoor group but now that we've

2548
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:41,239
done this one here and maybe that we

2549
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:43,719
just combine forces and just do like

2550
01:47:41,238 --> 01:47:45,479
Harvest and post Harvest like as a you

2551
01:47:43,719 --> 01:47:48,279
know just like a combined group because

2552
01:47:45,479 --> 01:47:50,879
you know I don't think it yeah obviously

2553
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:53,479
that like goes across like indoor and

2554
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:56,719
outdoor grind so we'll see I'll see how

2555
01:47:53,479 --> 01:48:00,479
how people are like positioned for that

2556
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:02,639
um other than that Riot seeds.com uh

2557
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:05,759
rioto Europe for those of you in Europe

2558
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:08,279
