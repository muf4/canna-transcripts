welcome to breeders Syndicate the only

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,719
cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,599
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,439
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,160
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,278
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,600
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,960
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,359
of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
cookies we are the traditional Market

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,600
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,238
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,358
has become much bigger than myself

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,230
welcome to the Cannabis underground this

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,920
is the

25
00:00:54,229 --> 00:01:01,919
[Music]

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
revolution

27
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,798
hello everyone welcome to the breed of

28
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:11,359
Syndicate I am thousandfold and tonight

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,159
I'll be your host because unfortunately

30
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,359
uh Matt isn't feeling very well um so we

31
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,920
got the youth here we have bringing back

32
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,359
farmer Dan uh from the last episode

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,359
which uh was quite the hit if you

34
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,519
haven't checked out the episode of farad

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,319
Dan I highly recommend checking it out

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,039
we've got MADD booze back and we've got

37
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,679
local back back as well and tonight

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,960
we're going to be talking about

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,240
selection so we're returning to some of

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,639
the breeding Theory uh that we started

41
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,759
on last season um and yeah also want to

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,000
recommend checking those out so I think

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,478
we did four or five

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,239
episodes uh on breeding and I've made a

45
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,798
little playlist on the channel so you

46
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,280
guys can go check that out I'll put in

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,520
the description as

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,280
well um but yeah so we thought we would

49
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,438
this is actually Boo's idea to do one

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,080
focused uh more focus on the selection

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,199
part of reading um I think for me what's

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,480
interesting is that you can't really

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,000
talk about selection without talking

54
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,318
about everything else right so it's

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,840
we'll probably go over some of the same

56
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,238
concept but from the point of view of

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,640
selection which I think will make it a

58
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,599
little bit different um and yeah

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,119
hopefully even though it's somewhat

60
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,799
theoretical we'll be able to lean on the

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,039
experience knowledge of some of these

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,760
guys uh and maybe get some like

63
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,840
anecdotes or examples as we go

64
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,919
on

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,080
um but yeah I think without further Ado

66
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:49,119
uh we can jump straight

67
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,640
into what are you selecting for um and

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,120
so I guess here with we're thinking

69
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,359
about like breeding

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,480
goals um we're thinking about like trait

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,920
selection um and perhaps another way of

72
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,639
thinking about this is like this is

73
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,719
maybe when you are thinking about the

74
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:11,119
genetic material you might have at hand

75
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,158
and where you might be taking it um I

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
wonder if farmer Dan could start us off

77
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,959
because I'm kind of curious I mean you

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
know we're kind of fresh from his

79
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,519
episode and I kind of want to know like

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,439
maybe from his work experience you know

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,640
what is that very initial point of

82
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,239
trying to decide like where a project

83
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,238
should

84
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,200
go um I think with a lot of people work

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,200
that it's honestly more like just an

86
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,318
exploration originally where they're

87
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,719
just like I like these two things I

88
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,479
think it would be fire if they go

89
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,318
together and it's kind of just more of a

90
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,000
mashup you know what I mean but like

91
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,719
that can still be real breeding if

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,080
you're like actually do Identify some

93
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,840
traits that you really like out of there

94
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,120
and um start selecting for that you know

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,280
and so um especially when there's like

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,120
not a lot of new avenues to go down and

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,318
so um I usually start with something

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,759
that I like app parent and so like a

99
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,399
popular one right now is rosin and so I

100
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,318
like to like really deep dive like why

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,879
like you really get in and see like

102
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,039
what's up with this plant's resin you

103
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:13,598
know and like microscope it you have to

104
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,359
wash it you have to see how it's

105
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,918
breaking off you know and just like

106
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,040
really hone in on that one

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,359
thing you know and that's kind of like

108
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,479
how I start is that like I just like

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,120
find something that I'm really

110
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,319
interested in and then I want to learn

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,600
everything about it before I even start

112
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,599
trying to work it you know

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,680
mhh I mean I think that's quite an

114
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,680
interesting distinction as well like

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,720
whether you have enough information to

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,879
even know what you are wanting or

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,639
looking for um because it might seem to

118
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,038
some people like ah like why are you

119
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,400
just growing these out without knowing

120
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,319
what you want but it's like how do you

121
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,399
know what you want without growing them

122
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,199
out yeah well and if you think about it

123
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,679
a lot of people buy seeds because they

124
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,639
don't have access to the Clone that they

125
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,199
want to grow and so if you can't get

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,840
Skittles you buy a skittles hybrid but

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,600
you still haven't experienced Skittles

128
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,719
yet and so you kind of have to grow

129
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,639
these and like that's your only

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,240
experience from it and maybe you do find

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,759
something you like you know and so like

132
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,840
you know what I mean not everyone's like

133
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,000
blessed to have this like wide staple of

134
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,318
plants to work with and like work with

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
them long enough to have like gained

136
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,319
experience with it and you know some

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,600
people have to start from just the first

138
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,400
seed packs they buy and so I feel like

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,000
that's kind of like more common than um

140
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,879
guys like us that have like you know

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,959
access to big libraries and stuff if we

142
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,918
want it or need it

143
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,198
MH um I don't know local and Bo like

144
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:42,680
yeah what do you guys think in terms of

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,240
like determining goals and you know

146
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,120
determining what you're looking for all

147
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,240
that what are some of your

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,720
thoughts yes so selection's sort of

149
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,439
Paramount to the whole process so the

150
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,080
the idea I had for this one was not so

151
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,759
much selection as you know what I mean

152
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,639
selecting a particular plant but the

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
whole process throughout like when you

154
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,918
even select a packet of seeds to begin

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
with like Dan said you know going with a

156
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,918
cultiv you're familiar with or perhaps

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,439
looking to delve into a line you're not

158
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,000
familiar with and and find something

159
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,639
else out like it really starts right at

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,759
the start so like right now for instance

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
um I'm not staying in the spot I'm at

162
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,520
for quite a long time I'm going to be

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
here for a couple months so for

164
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,478
selecting for my outdoor this year I I

165
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,239
went with shorter flowering things than

166
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,879
I usually would you know I didn't really

167
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,960
plan a breeding project or anything like

168
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,360
that just wanted to stick with

169
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,519
a couple of things that I'm interested

170
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,439
in taking a look at that won't fill up a

171
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,279
lot of time but when I'm selecting uh

172
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,079
it's pretty much always based on one

173
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,198
primary trait and and that's the effect

174
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:46,079
so um I think it's interesting having

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,160
Dan and having local on because uh it's

176
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,439
uh it's preference you know it's

177
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,520
personal preference when it comes to

178
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,240
effect as well and um there's a lot of

179
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,839
other selection criteria that comes into

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,079
it that can be like secondary criteria I

181
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,519
like to call them you know anything from

182
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,159
um the bouquet so you know the nose

183
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,560
flavor you know longevity of the high

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,599
stuff like that how it breeds Etc if

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,918
you're going like deeper into it all but

186
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,639
I think the primary thing people select

187
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,439
for uh should should always be high and

188
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,400
uh everything else lines up with that

189
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,719
you know so when you're you're making

190
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,318
like a large selection from a large pool

191
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,240
and youve found like a number of

192
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,879
cultivars that are have the effect that

193
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,918
you're looking for then you can start to

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,879
look into those secondary

195
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,560
characteristics and those LS you know

196
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,960
and see how many line up on the same

197
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,519
plant and go from there

198
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,560
but uh I I think it's interesting to

199
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,279
hear how other selects too because like

200
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,879
Dan in particular you know coming at it

201
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,598
working in um cultivation facilities you

202
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,919
know working in such large pools where

203
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,598
you're potentially calling and stuff

204
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,598
like that I'd love to hear sort of more

205
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,639
about that

206
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,319
too yeah yeah we we're going to get into

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
some of like the differences when you

208
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,919
get to SC like you know different scales

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,478
and stuff um and before we get dive into

210
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,240
some of those like yeah I want to hear

211
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,279
from local as well just like initial

212
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,519
thoughts when I say like you know

213
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,758
determining breeding goals trait

214
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,878
selection you know what do you

215
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,360
think um so yeah like um me for example

216
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,479
like I I sometimes I do pop things with

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,479
intentions but a lot of times it's kind

218
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:20,318
of right recently it's been just to kind

219
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:23,878
of learn stuff um but like once you kind

220
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,960
of have an idea you know like you kind

221
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,240
of have a direction on where you want to

222
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,239
take it based off of what you

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,200
saw

224
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:39,839
um like for example

225
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:43,919
um I have like a a sweet pee um it's

226
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,000
really really like narcotic and I I love

227
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,480
it a lot but I don't want narcotic lead

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,200
all the time um so like since I know

229
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:57,680
that um I think like you know

230
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,440
um an approach to kind of mitigate that

231
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:06,078
would be Crossing it to narrow leaf type

232
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:09,079
plant um something of that nature um

233
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:13,359
but yeah I don't I don't really pop

234
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:16,399
things with um like intentions to cross

235
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,200
just yet but I do like having Keepers

236
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,440
obviously from a

237
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,200
pack yeah yeah and I think you you

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,839
brought up a good point as well which is

239
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,839
you know sometimes you're just trying to

240
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,440
Counterpoint um certain things with with

241
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,760
other things um or like set up like you

242
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,800
know interesting like jux positions

243
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:38,000
between like two quite differently

244
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,120
expressing plants

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,440
um yeah okay no really interesting to

246
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,560
hear you all about like uh that thing

247
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,279
about intention and information because

248
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,479
you

249
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:50,278
can't really I think it's quite common

250
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,278
sense all you can't really have intent

251
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,360
without information really it just

252
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,958
doesn't it doesn't really make sense

253
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,399
yeah yeah I think all of us kind of

254
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,119
touched on the fact that it's just like

255
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,278
there is like an exploration period

256
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,799
perod for most people when they're like

257
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,559
growing something you

258
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,879
know yeah and you know we can we can now

259
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,319
turn to like some of the stuff that

260
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,200
booze is interested in like you know

261
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,240
some of the initial conditions I guess

262
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,120
of the genetic material you're working

263
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,120
with as well as like your

264
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,799
own uh scale constraints I guess you

265
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,240
could say like you know infrastructure

266
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,679
and resource constraints so yeah here's

267
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,120
where we we talk about like the

268
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,919
difference in

269
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,200
like maybe doing a an exploration or

270
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,199
hunt on on like a commercial scale like

271
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,240
Dan as opposed to some of the smaller

272
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,759
scales um yeah boo did you want to say

273
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,159
anything again about that stuff like

274
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,319
yeah just touching back quickly on so

275
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,719
just touching back on the goals and

276
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,160
stuff quickly too um even what Dan and I

277
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,320
were talking about before the show it's

278
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,039
kind of relevant to exposure as well

279
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
like local and I were talking about some

280
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,039
of the sativas and stuff that we've got

281
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,240
at the moment of smoking with and Dan's

282
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,120
like not as into theas but he came to

283
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,519
like look into some Mexican stuff so

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,560
your goal should be relevant to that as

285
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,639
well you know what I mean like if you've

286
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,199
been exposed to something you like it

287
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,159
you want to breed that because you know

288
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,680
it's the thing that you're into that's

289
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,278
um something that I think gets a little

290
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,559
bit overlooked and muddy these days

291
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,320
where a lot of people are just breeding

292
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,919
for maybe these secondary traits that

293
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,760
are less important uh like Instagram

294
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,958
sort of specific traits so yeah that's

295
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,480
another thing that um yeah I think it'd

296
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,479
be cool to get

297
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:34,159
into um so in terms of so sorry you

298
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,879
wanted to talk about

299
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,399
like uh primary and secondary traits is

300
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,600
that what you were suggesting or yeah

301
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm just saying that like in this day

302
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,720
and age so like back in the day when

303
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,278
yeah s yeah back in the day when there

304
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,639
was like less pressure to like breed for

305
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,720
Instagram and stuff like that and you

306
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,720
just breeding for yourself that it was

307
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,959
you know what I mean there was less need

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
to talk about this kind of stuff because

309
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,958
everyone was just breeding for primary

310
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,759
traits just the things that they like

311
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,719
which was the effect you know what I

312
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,480
mean in this day and age there's less

313
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,278
people that are are working in that line

314
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
and more towards these secondary traits

315
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,639
like the way things look or color and

316
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,039
stuff like that and so um yeah it's

317
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,919
interesting and then like when you get

318
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,278
into larger populations and stuff like

319
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,439
that when you're finding a lot of

320
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,838
cultivars that have got this uh effect

321
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,839
that you're looking for um yeah I just

322
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,920
want to hear how it's like how people

323
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,519
would go about that like you know how

324
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,838
you going to select a specific plant

325
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,278
when they're so similar you know what I

326
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,920
mean like are you going to have to look

327
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,120
to a lab and stuff like that and use

328
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,838
numbers so yeah I'm just interested to

329
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,480
hear how um some of the other fellas

330
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,040
sort of see these secondary traits and

331
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,278
how they'd select like if they've got a

332
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,039
line for instance like local with his um

333
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:44,879
electric boo across to Appalachia

334
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,480
Appalachia that he's popped he's got a

335
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,480
number of ones that he's like really

336
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,560
into so how does he go to whittling that

337
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
down to um you know just one or two

338
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,360
plants

339
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:04,838
um so so I grew uh a handful of those um

340
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,120
were

341
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:12,240
female um and they were um some that

342
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,879
looked like uh appy

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:20,079
um and kind of uh smelled like it um

344
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:24,559
more or less like some of those

345
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:27,198
um kind of um like I don't want like tar

346
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,439
fruit um I haven't like grown the appy

347
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:31,838
pure but I've seen some of like bod's

348
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,519
hybrids and there's like a common note

349
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,600
that is totally

350
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:41,440
appy um and a lot of those had that

351
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,720
smell and then there were some that had

352
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,760
um like dog [ __ ] smells um I've only

353
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,000
smoked the dog [ __ ] I haven't um grown

354
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,319
it myself

355
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,159
um

356
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,800
but what I I liked about a lot of these

357
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:04,519
not a lot of um like yeah maybe four out

358
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,758
of the the number that I grew uh they

359
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,600
had like really nice like sativa Spears

360
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,120
and I'm I'm kind of a sucker for that if

361
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,278
I'm being honest like that that's kind

362
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,360
of why I'm like looking at the sativas

363
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,480
like the high is great but man that like

364
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,199
that structure I mean you can make

365
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:27,320
something productive out of it

366
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:29,198
um but yeah I kind of um kept four of

367
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,399
those um that had

368
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,919
that structure um and now I'm kind of

369
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,879
just

370
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:41,519
uh doing a lot of the tests um smoking

371
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:44,559
right now um and some of them have like

372
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,078
a a leathery kind of savory thing going

373
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,000
on and then there's this one that has

374
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:54,719
like a mango gummy bear smell and it's

375
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,360
like kind of pretty transparent to taste

376
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,680
um and the effects are great and I'm

377
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,680
just like

378
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:08,120
uh it I'm kind of like don't know where

379
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,199
to go like do I just like go if they all

380
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,440
have the same effect do I just go for

381
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,439
Taste um and I'm kind of thinking so

382
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,199
like I think that's kind of the next

383
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,279
step and calling the the next or the

384
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:21,278
handful that I have at the

385
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,560
moment yeah there's like a the way I

386
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,198
think about it too is like when you're

387
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,399
working at home you have this like great

388
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,799
opportunity to like throw all those

389
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,278
secondary traits out the window and just

390
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,679
look at high because you're you're

391
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,399
really ideally just looking for

392
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,719
something that you like to work with and

393
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,639
that like you like the effects of and

394
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,040
then like when you start scaling up to

395
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,039
like going into a commercial scene well

396
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:50,198
then something's got to be like a five

397
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,198
out of five in every category or it's

398
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:55,359
not really like marketable in the way

399
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,198
that it kind of like has to be to like

400
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,039
sell well nowadays and there's that

401
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,039
whole secondary

402
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,519
drive like that they have to make a

403
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,958
profit off what they're making and what

404
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,000
they're selecting through and so like

405
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,399
secondary becomes like they all become

406
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,839
primary really because it has to smell

407
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,679
good it has to taste good and translate

408
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,399
it has to be like pretty and it has to

409
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,439
get you high and so it just like it

410
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,958
honestly limits the number of plants

411
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,800
that you can even find that meet the

412
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,559
criteria by like a few factors of 10 you

413
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,278
know I think I think we're at like a

414
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,679
tenth of a percent of everything that we

415
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:38,120
pop even has a chance to go commercial

416
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:40,758
and so it's a the numbers go way up and

417
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,078
then you start seeing tons of multiples

418
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,600
you start seeing maybe you don't find

419
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:46,078
what you're looking for at all in that

420
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,920
first generation and then you have to

421
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,758
kind of make the call of like oh well do

422
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,360
we try and like F2 it or BX it or like

423
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,839
keep moving it forward to see if it's

424
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,800
there or do you drop it you know and

425
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,800
because there's there's a financial cost

426
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,919
to all of it you I mean no matter what

427
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:05,159
scale but it's really significant at a

428
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:06,678
commercial scale and so um you can even

429
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,079
kind of get into the point where like

430
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,839
the process itself is its own selection

431
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:13,959
pressure because it has to Vibe within

432
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,198
your like speed and pacing of what

433
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,279
you're doing it has to Vibe with like

434
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,360
your soil and cultivation environment

435
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,959
and so like that's one of the things

436
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,759
that I've been noticing a lot is that

437
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,240
the process itself ends up becoming a

438
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,319
selection pressure that weeds out a lot

439
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,279
of really good plants that never even

440
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,279
get a chance to be

441
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:41,400
seen yeah no I makes sense absolutely um

442
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,798
that at higher numbers you you just

443
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,559
you're you're just increasingly

444
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:48,798
splitting hairs right yeah and at that

445
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:52,000
point you either need more information

446
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,440
or otherwise you have to rely on like

447
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,319
either like arbitrariness or like or

448
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,919
like your gut right yeah and you can do

449
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,480
things like comp pair testing numbers

450
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,120
but like does it really like represent

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,000
what people prefer in reality like from

452
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,918
what I've seen usually not and so um

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,880
then you start getting into this world

454
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,080
of like well how do you like quantify a

455
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,480
subjective experience in a way that we

456
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,119
can like run numbers on it and that's

457
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,000
really like it's a pretty interesting

458
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,719
challenge in itself of like um running

459
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,640
those types of surveys and then like

460
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,640
trying to run stats on it and like get

461
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,200
anything useful from it besides like oh

462
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,799
well these people liked it and these

463
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,480
people didn't you know it's really hard

464
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:36,720
to get answers out of people about that

465
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,319
kind of stuff too and so um when you're

466
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,519
breeding for yourself I feel like it's

467
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,839
really easy because you have that

468
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,240
freedom but yeah when you're breeding

469
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,000
for the masses it's like well what's

470
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,038
like the largest number of people gonna

471
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,240
enjoy and that's kind of like a weird

472
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:51,879
interesting perspective to have to take

473
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,558
on you

474
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,360
know I'll say this as well like this

475
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,000
conversation's quite a difficult one

476
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,719
because it will feel quite circular

477
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,599
MH uh right because you in in kind of

478
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,440
like we've already kind of articulated

479
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,959
how you kind have to move forward you

480
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,840
know weird like you have to move forward

481
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,519
to like move back to move like forward

482
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,759
again sometimes to get like you know

483
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,440
different kinds of

484
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:17,319
information

485
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,519
um but I think we kind of also jumped

486
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:21,319
straight into like literally the

487
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,798
evaluation decision-making part but

488
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:27,119
there are some other things I wanted us

489
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,079
to talk to first as well like so I had

490
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,479
this whole section that I thought we

491
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,599
could talk about which I call like

492
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,960
initial conditions so this is stuff like

493
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,798
what numbers are you working with what

494
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,519
generation you know what filial

495
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,960
Generations are you working with uh how

496
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,759
stable already you know how narrow uh is

497
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,960
the is the pool that you're working with

498
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,720
and if you've already determined you

499
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,519
know what your your target you know

500
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,679
primary secondary traits are you know

501
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,839
how much do you know about the

502
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,640
likelihood of those traits being

503
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,759
passed um so this kind of I guess this

504
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,400
kind of information partly arises from

505
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,000
an exploration already but partly it's

506
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,200
also about like the numbers you're

507
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,159
working with and like yeah like I said

508
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,000
like the filial generation and like what

509
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:16,799
you know of like the boundedness I guess

510
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,480
of the of the genetic pool already um do

511
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,400
any of you have like Reflections on like

512
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,720
what some of those things how some of

513
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
those things would

514
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,000
affect the project overall or like how

515
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,720
you start

516
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,279
out yes say like if you yeah got a

517
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,079
little case study sort of thing man so

518
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,599
to speak so going back to that I guess

519
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,038
trait base selection we've got a cutting

520
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:42,038
a friend of mine found Eli local bird

521
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,158
seed shout out dude uh it's sine cross

522
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:46,839
to Kentucky blueg Gras from pip so it's

523
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,559
still Violet so he found it in I think

524
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:52,319
out of two packets or one packet it was

525
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:54,399
one of the runy aenos super low yielding

526
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,119
compared to the rest but the smoke is

527
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
just yeah it's unlike the others in the

528
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,639
pack super dank always Lays me out cuts

529
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,600
through it's got an amazing nose on it

530
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,679
too but it was an outlier so to speak

531
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,519
from that pack so right now we're going

532
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,080
through the stages of how to work on

533
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,400
that so he's done some hybrids uh he's

534
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,199
done a couple of interesting ones he

535
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,440
crossed it to uh Southern Charm from

536
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,519
goat and monkey which is like a Irene TK

537
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,880
so already there he's going back to a

538
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,839
grandparent of sorts you know what I

539
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,039
mean it's the in the from the saene on

540
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,199
the mother side of the steel bolot so

541
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:29,158
that's one way where he's tried to uh

542
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,400
just enhance that effect to go back to

543
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,880
an initial parent you know what I mean

544
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,278
so like a back Cross of sorts and so

545
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,320
working that forward we're trying to

546
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:37,440
think well how are we going to be able

547
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,759
to put that into a seed form how can we

548
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,120
get that particular phena to pop out

549
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,240
when it itself already was an outlier so

550
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,199
talking about like selfing it so we want

551
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,000
to S1 it and then listening to what

552
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
people like chir and Caleb have said

553
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,359
about locking in traits by selfing you

554
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,240
have to take it to an S2 but then an S2

555
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,278
as a seed line can be something that's

556
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,480
uh generally hard to germinate or this

557
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:00,278
that and the other or you can just

558
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,319
present itself a lot of problems like

559
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,880
even popping s1's like I had this idea

560
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,119
about when you get s1's you're going to

561
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,520
pop them and it's going to be like an

562
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,239
exact replica of the parent so when I

563
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,400
see all these s1's off it I'm like oh

564
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,919
okay that's just you know what I mean if

565
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,200
I want to try that clone I'll buy that

566
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,640
S1 but then in growing a few packets out

567
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,440
and seeing like all these weird like

568
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,559
runty like inbred Expressions that come

569
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,960
out of it I'm like oh okay so maybe like

570
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,960
a feminized hybrid is the way to go to

571
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,240
find like a better expression of that

572
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,038
initial parent you know and so now it's

573
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,640
just like like you said a little

574
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,079
circular but it's like what path do we

575
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,440
take you know there there seems to be

576
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,199
like multiple ways to skin this cat so

577
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,400
if I'm trying to like lock in this one

578
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,400
trait and select just for that when it

579
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,919
itself was an outlier like you know

580
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,720
there's a few paths to go down so I've

581
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,679
listed like you know Crossing it to

582
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,038
itself a couple of times or potentially

583
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,159
hybridizing it and searching for that so

584
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:50,919
that's something that I'm interesting in

585
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,720
if you guys have gotten any experience

586
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,120
of having like a particular trait that

587
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,798
was you know not super prevalent in the

588
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,959
line like um say like that Cherry AK or

589
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:00,519
something something like that and how

590
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,038
you would go about potentially breeding

591
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:03,038
towards

592
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,079
that yeah like I think an easy one is

593
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,798
like the Z TPS because it seems to be

594
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,359
just like this oneoff in the genan pool

595
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,119
because like when you S1 it you don't

596
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,798
find things that are like exactly like Z

597
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,079
they'll be close they'll be nice they'll

598
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,918
be similar but they're not dead ringers

599
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,119
and so um you this is like the part in

600
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,120
the process where I feel like you have

601
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,000
to get like a little your hands dirty

602
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,719
too like you do your pedigree analysis

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,319
to the best of your ability and kind of

604
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,919
like look at what the parents are if you

605
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,720
know anything about those parents like

606
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,679
what do you see about like in the

607
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,640
progyny of like what you're working like

608
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,080
a hybrid of them you know um to just

609
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,200
like identify like what you think might

610
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,399
be coming from where but then like you

611
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,038
really have to like to see how

612
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,919
something's like past or to see how

613
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,079
stable or inbred or narrow it is you

614
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,159
know you have to uh like roll up your

615
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:02,319
sleeves and start you know growing out

616
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:05,440
plants and so like on the z um it seems

617
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:09,000
to me that that Aroma profile that's

618
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,919
like really pungent is a fairly

619
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,440
recessive trait and so when you outcross

620
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,080
it to something that it's not closely

621
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,080
related to you don't see it pop up very

622
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,918
often at all you see kind of like its

623
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:24,798
dwarfism its like resin traits of being

624
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:27,000
like Sandy and kind of oiless um but you

625
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,558
don't see those those tur profiles show

626
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,599
up very often

627
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,038
um and what I've kind of noticed is like

628
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,439
I had to like

629
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:37,558
re-evaluate the process that I was doing

630
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,679
well like maybe using that parent itself

631
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,918
doesn't pass that trait the way that I

632
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,840
want it to well what if I take two of

633
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,520
its children that

634
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,319
like they may not even have the profile

635
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,319
but they have a nice one and if you

636
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,639
cross them together you get this double

637
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,599
up of that recessive you know and so

638
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,240
that took like a lot of and that worked

639
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,319
for me you know and I found a few nice

640
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,359
plants that were kind of exact what I

641
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,359
wanted and um but it was almost random

642
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,599
at a certain point because like yeah I

643
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,599
had an idea of the project but I had to

644
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,798
like grow all the plants out and I found

645
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,918
two out of you know like a couple dozen

646
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,158
that were exactly what I wanted you know

647
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,799
and so um you really have to just like

648
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,720
start making the crosses and growing the

649
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,839
plants out to see like how something's

650
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,000
inherited um local any Reflections on

651
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,918
that not that I could add at the

652
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,798
particular

653
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:37,200
now yeah yeah

654
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:39,918
um anything to say about how do I put it

655
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,600
uh feels like we have covered okay Dan

656
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,640
maybe what's your take on like in terms

657
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,079
of starting points

658
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,440
like does it change your approach to

659
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:52,519
know that you're working with an S1

660
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,519
versus like an

661
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,759
outcross yeah cuz you can kind of like

662
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,440
feel that there's no outside influence

663
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,519
of another variety you know like I I

664
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,759
look at s1's as like a peak into what

665
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:07,798
the the parentage might be especially on

666
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,640
these like clone only types and so um

667
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,918
that's like one of like on the same like

668
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,440
example like a zerp thing that's like my

669
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,919
next Avenue of uh exploration is like

670
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,519
well do the s1's pass it better than the

671
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,480
the original clone did you know and so

672
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,398
I've I've yet to see like a real world

673
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,720
example of that yet but in other s1's

674
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:30,158
I've grown uh

675
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,440
you know like you can definitely see

676
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,200
what gets locked in easily and then the

677
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,440
things that are like more Elusive and so

678
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,759
then you can start

679
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,480
um kind of like playing with that in

680
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:45,038
your mind and kind of unraveling the

681
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:48,079
mystery in the puzzle um on like filial

682
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,879
Generation Um I had a thought on that as

683
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:54,439
well um because I've had projects where

684
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,840
like I had a really nice mom and a a

685
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,038
reversal that you know passed the traits

686
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,839
that I wanted but but a lot of the

687
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,480
traits were kind of lost in that F1

688
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,678
hybrid and they were all kind of bland

689
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,880
and kind of boring and it actually took

690
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,440
getting to that F2 Generation to kind of

691
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,440
like segregate traits a little bit and

692
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,440
get the Expressions that were more

693
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,880
interesting and a wider variety of them

694
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,798
where that that F1 hybrid was kind of a

695
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,320
the honestly one of the closer things to

696
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:22,000
an F1 I've seen where like all the

697
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,639
plants were like identical and like you

698
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,200
know just like a slight Nuance

699
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,240
difference in Aroma between um

700
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,919
uh between each other you know and then

701
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,880
in the F2 Generation you got this wide

702
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,880
segregation of all kinds of stuff and

703
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,240
that was so much more fun to play with

704
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,760
and look through than that F1 because

705
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,399
it's like I'm not trying to make like a

706
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,158
true F1 hybrid where they're all

707
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,839
identical like I'm not growing fields of

708
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,080
weed I want really interesting and novel

709
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,918
combinations of things and so filial

710
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:53,398
generation can play sometimes it's worth

711
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:56,519
going forward because you know you're

712
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,558
actually going to get new

713
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,159
combinations

714
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,359
yeah and I think that does articulate

715
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,960
one of the big tensions uh within every

716
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:09,918
project where it's are you looking for

717
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,679
outliers or are you looking for

718
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,720
stabilization or

719
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,759
homogenization right is that is that

720
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,159
like a feir

721
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,240
paraphrase yeah like I don't really want

722
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,840
like homogeny you know like that's like

723
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,240
that's a really common goal of plant

724
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,839
breeding because of the application but

725
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,000
like when you're growing indoors and

726
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,959
it's a clone

727
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,359
that you want identical to be packaged

728
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,240
so the consumer can have the same

729
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,798
experience every time that they go and

730
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,558
buy that which is like a standard across

731
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:39,038
all commercial products really you know

732
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:40,798
like you don't want a different

733
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,119
experience every time you go open a can

734
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,519
of Coke you know but weed's kind of more

735
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,158
on that like

736
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:50,519
wine uh you know like more like sensory

737
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,840
pleasing type of product that like

738
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,200
everyone kind of has a different

739
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,240
preference and a different like it's

740
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,159
just like beer you know um some people

741
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
want their cheap beer they Mexican beer

742
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,919
their craft Brews you know um and so

743
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,880
there's got to be something for everyone

744
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,399
and that's why I don't really breed for

745
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,320
anything but diversity now because it's

746
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,879
like I want to find new combinations of

747
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,639
things I don't want a seedline that's

748
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,080
like all Keepers because it's so much

749
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,640
easier to fix the secondary traits than

750
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,960
the high you know and so that's what you

751
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,200
I always find in a really stable line is

752
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,960
like kind of boring

753
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,640
weed is I'm interested in Boo's

754
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Reflections on this uh because I think

755
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,519
that's an interesting take which is that

756
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,919
like um can you say it again secondary

757
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:39,399
traits are easier to fix yeah like it's

758
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,080
easier to fix the structure the look The

759
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,158
you know what I mean like it it's it's

760
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,720
not that hard to make most of the plants

761
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,600
look the same but to get all of them to

762
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,839
be like a great high or a higher

763
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,639
prevalence of them because it's like

764
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,319
breeding's a stats game really like

765
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,919
you're looking to like increase the

766
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,759
probability that something's found in

767
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,799
you know like if it's 1 to 20 in the

768
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,879
original you doing your selections maybe

769
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,918
brings that up to one and four or one

770
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,600
and two and that's a success you know

771
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,519
what I mean that's like um it's far as

772
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:11,480
like a stabilization project goes um but

773
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:15,359
like fixing High seems to be like really

774
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,599
elusive that is fascinating who thoughts

775
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,678
it's why the whole thing's such a yeah

776
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,119
man it's like why the whole thing's such

777
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,679
a head [ __ ] for me because you get

778
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,558
something like all right you get an

779
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,080
elite and you times it to an elite and

780
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,720
you're likely to you know what I mean

781
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,798
you're starting the good stock on both

782
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,120
sides the

783
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:30,679
you know you can kind of expect what

784
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,639
you're going to get but then you get

785
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,120
something you know you hear about like

786
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,519
the breeding of Hayes and stuff like

787
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,119
that and how they had to work through

788
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,759
you know so many generations and so many

789
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,678
different lines and like made so many

790
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,440
wrong steps so it's just tricky to get

791
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,640
my head around and I guess like you said

792
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,880
there's no like one way to go about it

793
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,038
there's so many different ways but I'm

794
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,159
um you know like you just don't want to

795
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:53,759
forget something in a line like even

796
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,120
what local said about before and all

797
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,919
right um I want I saw a few Expressions

798
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,278
come through that were like spear like

799
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,320
and you know they really had the high

800
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,240
that I want so if I select for that way

801
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,558
like you know through link traits and

802
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,638
that like what am I leaving behind so I

803
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:10,440
think realistically I'm like I'm looking

804
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,759
for a model that can be applied to to a

805
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,200
lot of different selections like whether

806
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,200
I'm working with some sativas and some

807
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,319
hazes and stuff like that whether I'm

808
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,880
like looking through some some indicas

809
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,119
or some you know what I mean some some

810
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,840
more broadleaf stuff um how can I know

811
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,278
that I'm going to be like how what's

812
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,918
like a Target model for breeding you

813
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:31,359
know what I mean like what's a Target

814
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,799
model for for not leaving these traits

815
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:37,959
behind I had a I had a kind of uh

816
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:42,158
tangential question maybe off this which

817
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:46,038
is we've talked about effect being you

818
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,000
know a primary trait that you know we we

819
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,558
can somewhat agree on partly because

820
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,119
it's elusive but partly also because

821
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,319
it's desirable right what about

822
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,839
something like smell

823
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,200
flavor because that there those two are

824
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,918
often sometimes even

825
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,120
like uh pitched as though they were

826
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,278
intention right like sometimes you know

827
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,518
you can find something that has great

828
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,798
smell and flavor but it doesn't have the

829
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,000
potency right so often you hear about

830
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:11,000
that

831
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,919
tension yeah I guess that's like with

832
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,558
the Skittles and stuff like that what

833
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,399
dam was talking about it's not like

834
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,240
purported to be exceptionally potent but

835
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,798
it's still you know what I mean Super

836
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,880
famous line everyone's into it and even

837
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,960
like what Caleb's doing with the

838
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,639
reversals and stuff like that um

839
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,440
reversing one of his selections like

840
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:33,119
making S2s looking for that particular

841
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,399
smell so I guess yeah even with the

842
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,239
bubble gum and that everyone says it's

843
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,798
not the most potent line but you know

844
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,558
it's got an amazing no so I guess these

845
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,038
are considerations you know people are

846
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:44,638
doing these kind of things so like on a

847
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,359
larger scale Dan like when you were um

848
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:48,398
doing some of these breeding for for

849
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,000
other facilities and stuff like that was

850
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,558
that one of their major concerns like I

851
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,079
know you said in your interview that you

852
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:54,440
were you had selections that you might

853
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,678
want to have kept but they never would

854
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,880
have seen the light of day because they

855
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,320
weren't what met the the quoter or the

856
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,880
you know what I mean status quo there or

857
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,359
whatever how how did that go was it like

858
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,080
they were going for the stinkier sort of

859
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,678
ones or the ones that you know bit

860
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,480
better Aesthetics so no sometimes

861
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,720
there's stuff that's like really tasty

862
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,440
and like really or has a really nice eye

863
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,720
but it's like horribly

864
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,600
ugly you know it's just like not gonna

865
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,319
be salable or marketable because like

866
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,519
you could never take a nice picture of

867
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,599
it and like a lot of times those will go

868
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,599
into like either like future breeding

869
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,638
projects but like most the time they end

870
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,638
up in the bin you know because it's like

871
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:35,759
it was almost good which is not good

872
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:37,798
enough um and so uh it's it's kind of

873
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,440
unfortunate in that right but there is a

874
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,519
lot of people that breed like almost

875
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,960
exclusively for flavor because like

876
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
potency itself is also subjective you

877
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,519
know some people only like to get so

878
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,720
high I hear that from a lot of older

879
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,759
folks like when I've been in

880
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,720
dispensaries and stuff and there's some

881
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,240
senior citizen with their veteran hat on

882
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,558
and they're like oh the last stuff you

883
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,558
gave us was like way too way too strong

884
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,678
like we need need something lighter and

885
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,678
so um there's like a whole portion of

886
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,120
the demograph or a whole demographic of

887
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,720
the um consumer pool that like kind of

888
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,000
wants light weed because you know when

889
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,878
they maybe first tried it or whatever it

890
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,878
was probably only 10% THC or less and so

891
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:19,878
uh um I actually do like tasty weed it's

892
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,679
not like it usually is lower potency in

893
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,838
my opinion as far as like Fruity and

894
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,358
Candy stuff um but it's desirable in its

895
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:28,719
own right like I like to have them

896
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:31,398
around and like do blends with more

897
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,799
potent weed like a nice OG or a chem or

898
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:35,679
a hybrid of that you know um and then

899
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,639
put some really tasty wheed on top and

900
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,440
get some of that flavor and so I think

901
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,079
it all has its place you

902
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,480
know I want to ask you as well Dan like

903
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,720
and this is probably what I would

904
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,679
consider like a naive question uh but

905
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,319
you mentioned before that you thought

906
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,280
fixing effects was harder than fixing

907
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,680
some of the other like maybe more

908
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,680
structural uh trait

909
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,279
would you say the same of smell and

910
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,440
flavor that it that that can be hard to

911
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,119
fix as well or yeah it can be pretty

912
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,039
elusive some stuff breeds really

913
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,039
dominant for it you know and you can see

914
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,079
that and it makes life really easy

915
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:13,838
because it's just like every time you

916
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,880
have like a population you're working

917
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,078
with like for me right it has to be the

918
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,160
five out of five things um every time

919
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,000
one of those is fixed it just makes my

920
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,000
pool of selection slightly easier to

921
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,559
pick through because then you can go

922
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,800
based off of potency and other four you

923
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,320
know like it makes it Easy by

924
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,960
eliminating one of them because they're

925
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,079
like oh they're all really pretty or

926
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,800
they all taste really good and so um

927
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,599
that doesn't have to be a pressure at

928
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
that point you know and you can start

929
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,079
looking more and diving into the other

930
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,078
things without that convoluting

931
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,719
it

932
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,040
yeah I feel like there was part of that

933
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:55,719
I didn't answer but we're all Stoners

934
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,159
sorry no no no I think I think that was

935
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,159
you know I think we got we we got the

936
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:02,920
point and there's also of course like no

937
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,559
definitive way we can say that

938
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,800
like uh that's always going to be true

939
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,480
right like it's just we're just talking

940
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,760
about like what from what you know

941
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,960
someone like Dan has seen uh in his

942
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,319
experience

943
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,400
um yeah I mean anything else in terms of

944
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:21,199
like some of these I'm calling them

945
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,960
initial considerations but it seems

946
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,399
silly to call them that now because like

947
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,400
we discussed like you already have had

948
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,119
to done quite a bit of work to even know

949
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,838
about some of these questions or answers

950
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,200
I guess um anyone have any other

951
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,039
Reflections because if not we can move

952
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:39,480
on to quite an interesting thing which I

953
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,920
think people don't get to talk about

954
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,679
that much um in this

955
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,119
process anything from you

956
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,480
local or anyone

957
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,160
else yeah well I've got something but I

958
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,559
think it leads into the the second bit

959
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,118
so I don't want to I don't want to

960
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,039
[ __ ] all right we we can just so we

961
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,559
can move on and then you know again like

962
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,838
this talk honestly like while I've set

963
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,440
out these kind of

964
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,838
like progression of points like honestly

965
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,559
we're just going to keep looking back so

966
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,480
whatever so the next thing I wanted to

967
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,078
characteristics and stuff like that like

968
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,880
I've been [ __ ] on them a bit but

969
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,240
relevant to note taking well they're

970
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,599
super important because you can't smoke

971
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,799
it till the end you know what I mean so

972
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,400
you don't know really how the effect is

973
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,440
going to be so having all those

974
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,519
secondary characteristics to lead into

975
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,119
your note taking and breeding notes and

976
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,318
stuff like that super

977
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,200
important well that was that is this

978
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:30,000
section right so this section is about

979
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,279
like I think again especially from Dan

980
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,199
it must be it would be very different

981
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,400
from like anyone

982
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,480
doing uh breeding with seed making at

983
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,160
home but it's about organization and

984
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,960
like how you you organize your

985
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:44,639
information uh your data collection all

986
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,720
of that um but maybe this time we start

987
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,358
with like booze or local like on a

988
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:53,000
smaller scale like how do you get ready

989
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,559
to embark on this kind of project like

990
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,760
what do you prepare in terms of like

991
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,440
your notes or documentation you know

992
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,000
that kind of thing do you take notes

993
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,720
local like do you have like a little

994
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,760
notebook that you're writing down all

995
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,759
your observations on or do you just take

996
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,480
pictures or what's your call um I do a

997
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,119
lot of pictures but I also like you know

998
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:18,000
I have like a note on my iPhone um that

999
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,318
I kind of keep like track of the smells

1000
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,159
more or less

1001
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:26,279
um

1002
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:30,519
cuz like I don't know you you can't

1003
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,119
really smoke it like you said so

1004
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:36,400
this information

1005
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,720
is it's relevant but it it's not

1006
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,000
relevant until like you you've done the

1007
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,919
final analysis of all the data I

1008
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,079
guess yeah because I like to look back

1009
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,720
on it after like I I generally keep two

1010
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,800
separate sets of notes like the ones I'm

1011
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,239
holding now like handwritten and that's

1012
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,359
like while pretty much like from week

1013
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,959
two or three of flow I start doing that

1014
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,759
so I don't really care about in Edge you

1015
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,440
know what I mean things will just do the

1016
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,319
what they'll do and generally I'll group

1017
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,720
them like before I flow them out I'll

1018
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:06,639
just group [ __ ] from highest to from

1019
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,838
like tallest to shortest you know and

1020
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,679
that might not be realistic of what

1021
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,639
they're going to perform like just like

1022
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,838
growing a bunch of stuff from seed I'll

1023
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,039
do it that way and then I'll start

1024
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,559
taking notes yeah week two or three flow

1025
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,400
pretty much once they start putting

1026
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,880
putting out a smell so I'll be like

1027
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,680
writing down you know Aroma On the stem

1028
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,119
um if I'm seeing any resin or stuff like

1029
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,838
that even the way like the FL floral

1030
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,760
structure is so um if it's like tall or

1031
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,719
short or uh how similar they are to one

1032
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,480
another and then depending on how many

1033
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,799
things I'm running I'll start grouping

1034
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,400
them as well like if I'm running um I

1035
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,359
don't know 14 different fenos from a

1036
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,720
line and I see that okay three of them

1037
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:44,000
are presenting this like you know sort

1038
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,480
of more rounded top more of like a moth

1039
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,719
Bly sort of nose whereas these other

1040
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,639
ones are more like you know Spears

1041
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,399
taller bit more gassy I'll like group

1042
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,039
them together and then when I'm actually

1043
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,838
trying everything out after drying it

1044
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,440
and assessing again I'll um go and those

1045
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:01,119
categories and assess that way and so

1046
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,920
like when I'm whittling down um you know

1047
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,400
14 fenos down to to four you know I'll

1048
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,079
have my four different categories and

1049
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,200
you know select the best one from each

1050
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,680
of those categories and then go from

1051
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,239
there so that's that's how I like to do

1052
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,679
mine I um I think it's really helpful

1053
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:16,679
like I used to just do it all in my head

1054
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,078
and I still do like for the greenhouse

1055
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,118
where I'm just growing like one packet

1056
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,240
of seeds but where I'm working indoors

1057
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,559
and I've got like you know multiple

1058
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,118
packs of things on the go and I'm trying

1059
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,119
to like keep on top of everything I find

1060
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,760
it super handy then when I'm calling

1061
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,358
I'll generally just go through you know

1062
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,599
and just assess and um group

1063
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,799
characteristics and then yeah cut back

1064
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,800
from

1065
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,960
there yeah I'd have to say like my like

1066
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,640
home process is like really similar to

1067
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,760
that as well like I just keep a lab

1068
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:51,239
notebook like I did in college and [ __ ]

1069
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,880
and um I set off a section leave a few

1070
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:56,318
pages and just take notes on you know

1071
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,519
structure and height and you know

1072
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:01,800
estimated flower time when I cut it down

1073
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,440
um if it was responding well to like

1074
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,960
just the base feed that I was giving

1075
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,079
everything if it needed something extra

1076
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,000
or like needed more water on average

1077
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,680
just like really base cultivation notes

1078
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,119
so that when I come back and find if I

1079
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,879
find something I like and I come back

1080
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,599
and regrow it that I'm not like starting

1081
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,720
from square one again with like you know

1082
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,760
uh what I think they're probably going

1083
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:25,799
to prefer and like um but um it gets a

1084
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,880
lot more hectic at a commercial scale

1085
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,839
because

1086
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,519
um I was just talking about it with on

1087
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:33,799
the server with someone in the DMS and I

1088
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:38,039
was just like it's it's chaos at times

1089
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,680
man I have like 40 spreadsheets and um

1090
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:41,519
they've got everything from like like

1091
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,719
I'm a little tedious with my notes right

1092
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,920
especially at work because like I'm

1093
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,879
taking notes all the way through flower

1094
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,559
just like brief ones and like they're

1095
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,358
really just like what stands out the

1096
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,358
most when I'm like going through a big

1097
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:55,960
room of like seedlings and you know

1098
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,559
they're already flowering like it's like

1099
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,240
I'll take a few small notes but it's

1100
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,679
really at the end um where we start

1101
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,719
getting a little more intensive and so

1102
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,960
like I'll look at like it's height it's

1103
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,719
General stature like it has big strong

1104
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,838
stems or it's thin and lanky I'll look

1105
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,719
at uh like its Leaf ToBD ratio if it has

1106
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,199
like lots and lots of big fan leaves

1107
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,598
coming out of the buds or if it's more

1108
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,598
like an OG and they kind of just are

1109
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,680
little skirt at the bottom kind of thing

1110
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,359
you know um I'll look at a lot of resin

1111
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:29,879
traits like whether it's sticky Sandy

1112
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,960
I'll look at uh you know General Aroma

1113
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,599
profiles triome density as far as like

1114
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,440
is it like you know coated or not and so

1115
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,280
like I have a lot of like um qualitative

1116
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,760
scales that I use for that where it'll

1117
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,160
be you know like high resin density

1118
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,839
versus medium or low kind of thing and

1119
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:51,199
like you know little sub ones in between

1120
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,558
um but um yeah the the real note taking

1121
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,480
happens after it's dry you know that's

1122
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,480
where I start getting like a lot more

1123
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,079
meticulous about like Aroma notes and

1124
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,199
effect notes and um what I

1125
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,960
like there's a part of me that wishes I

1126
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,439
had that much more time and money

1127
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,440
because I would totally build something

1128
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,880
for you yeah it'd be fun I've been

1129
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,240
wanting to do a community one honestly

1130
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,838
where it's like you know like send out a

1131
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,558
pack of seeds and I'm like all right you

1132
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,199
can grow it your way but it's like these

1133
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,519
are the traits and like the things that

1134
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,598
we're looking at and these are the

1135
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,239
scales and it would take some big effort

1136
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,318
you know what I mean but I think it'd be

1137
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,279
really cool like crowdsource Big Data

1138
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,239
pools like that where you're like have a

1139
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,640
thousand seeds popped of something you

1140
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:36,078
know I was thinking mostly just about

1141
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:38,400
managing the data so I could know I can

1142
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,680
easily Envision like a tool with like a

1143
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,240
proper database um with you know proper

1144
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:46,199
querying and Reporting and everything um

1145
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,558
yeah that's what I was talking using

1146
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:51,679
spreadsheets yeah yeah yeah there's like

1147
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,319
a few um there's like a a company called

1148
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,719
like breed Bas there's a bunch of them

1149
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:58,239
honestly that are like kind of plug

1150
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:00,598
andplay Solutions um but um there's no

1151
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,399
like can of specific ones as far as I

1152
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,200
know so there actually might be a market

1153
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,880
for that you know because it is kind of

1154
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:09,879
its own different process and like the

1155
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,519
needs May differ vastly from like a

1156
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,400
normal crop that's in the ground for

1157
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,280
quite a while or you know only gets

1158
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,039
turned over once a

1159
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,640
year

1160
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:23,679
yeah yeah but it it's clear like how

1161
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,838
critical documentation and like proper

1162
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,480
archival is for this process especially

1163
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,880
on like a certain scale because like

1164
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,719
booze was saying there's just no way you

1165
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,318
can hold that stuff in your head past a

1166
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:36,078
certain point even as a homeg grower

1167
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,639
like I had some plants that I forgot to

1168
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,680
take notes on because it was like during

1169
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:42,440
that whole surgery thing and um I was

1170
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,279
looking at them dry and I'm like I can't

1171
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,159
remember anything about this there's

1172
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,519
five of

1173
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,639
them it is easy to forget yeah it is

1174
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,280
yeah and so even it's also not long

1175
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:58,759
before like your current run just blurs

1176
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:02,800
into like previous ones as well for

1177
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:06,480
sure yeah um anyone else got any other

1178
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,240
points on like organization or like

1179
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,119
documentation yeah danam when you're

1180
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,959
doing like those massive pops like 600

1181
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,720
seeds or whatever are you guys calling

1182
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,119
in veg or like early bloom like based on

1183
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,959
some of these traits if like you're not

1184
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,039
seeing enough resin density or whatever

1185
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:25,039
or no nothing like that but we will call

1186
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:27,159
stuff that's like uh like um not

1187
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,079
thriving in the environment like if it

1188
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:31,159
misses like you know cuz we have to like

1189
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:35,119
clone everything keep a backup copy and

1190
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:37,078
then send it off to flower um and so um

1191
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,680
if something like say doesn't clone

1192
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,920
easily it'll probably get taken out if

1193
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,118
something um isn't thriving in the

1194
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,440
environment it probably gets taken out

1195
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,160
if it Herms it definitely gets taken out

1196
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,240
like Zero Tolerance on that sort of

1197
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:55,558
stuff and so um you end up like removing

1198
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:56,838
probably about 40 to 50% of the plants

1199
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,119
based on on some of these traits on

1200
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:02,239
certain runs because they're just more

1201
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,760
prevalent in those lines for whatever

1202
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,399
reason I'd love to have the numbers to

1203
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,280
be able to do that you know what I mean

1204
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,880
because I keep [ __ ] like my buddy will

1205
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,559
pop like s1's or whatever and he's like

1206
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,358
oh anyone that comes up looking mutant

1207
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,400
or trifol or whatever I'll just [ __ ] him

1208
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:18,199
off but I'm sitting there thinking like

1209
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,119
man my friend found you know this one of

1210
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:21,639
the best plant I've ever smoked and you

1211
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,480
know it was this runty little thing so

1212
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:25,358
I'm like you know if I'm throwing away

1213
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,240
all these little ones I'll you know what

1214
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,239
what am my behind potentially so I'll

1215
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:30,639
keep him and I'll just baby him like if

1216
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:32,838
I keep him in the veg a little bit

1217
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,159
longer and you know FL him out longer

1218
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:36,279
than the others I'll hang on to them

1219
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,719
because yeah so I always wonder like in

1220
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,400
large facilities you know you'd be

1221
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,959
stupid when you've got like investors

1222
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,760
and stuff as well you know you can't

1223
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,199
spend time [ __ ] around with like you

1224
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,800
know seedlings that just won't veg Etc

1225
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,759
so yeah it's interesting to hear there

1226
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,200
is a cost to it though you know because

1227
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,119
it's like a lot of people say those

1228
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,000
runts are the best smoke a lot of the

1229
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,640
time you know and so that's one of the

1230
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,679
things I wonder when people talk about

1231
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,679
like that the highs are disappearing on

1232
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:04,000
on Modern weed now is just like if it's

1233
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,318
really the process selection pressor

1234
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,199
that's like removing Those runs before

1235
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,838
they even have a chance to be evaluated

1236
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:13,199
as flower kind of thing you

1237
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:14,838
know there's something funny to me about

1238
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,719
this because it's

1239
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:21,039
like

1240
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:22,639
the I I feel like CSI is one of those

1241
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,679
people who's famous for saying that he

1242
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,879
likes growing out those runs right or

1243
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:30,078
seeing what referencing yeah yeah yeah

1244
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,599
yeah yeah yeah cuz once you've lost them

1245
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,559
you can't even go back and know whether

1246
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,920
you made the right decision or not I

1247
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,079
guess unless you like keep them all the

1248
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,760
way until the end still and just just to

1249
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,720
like prove to yourself that you made the

1250
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,040
right call but that's so much working

1251
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,039
and of itself um yeah and again at that

1252
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,880
scale it almost necessitates being

1253
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:50,800
really ruthless because you have to be

1254
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,720
but I mean like Skittles I think is a

1255
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,160
dwarfy little mutant that probably would

1256
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,759
get cold in any facility ogkb is

1257
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,719
probably a little dwarf mutant that

1258
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,359
nobody would select for I think OG even

1259
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,480
to a certain degree falls into that

1260
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:06,318
category because it's real finicky it'd

1261
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,880
probably get cold nowadays just because

1262
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:10,480
nobody wants to grow it because it's

1263
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,000
like you know it doesn't fit the model

1264
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,679
that's going around these days that's an

1265
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,639
interesting point right because am I

1266
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,598
right in thinking

1267
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:22,598
that by any idealization of like

1268
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,960
structure and yield and everything a lot

1269
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:30,079
of hype strains wouldn't necessarily

1270
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,559
like be ideal fits right so fashion and

1271
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,720
the market are also clearly playing

1272
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:37,400
playing a huge role um in I mean it's an

1273
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,838
obvious thing to say but I think that

1274
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,440
actually kind of links back to what we

1275
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:43,679
were talking about earlier with the um

1276
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,559
like fixing secondary traits is like one

1277
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,719
of the reasons that's so easy is because

1278
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,440
in the modern gene pool it's all coming

1279
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,598
from such a narrowed down point that

1280
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,639
it's already fixed for me like I don't

1281
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,000
have to select for Purple OG structured

1282
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:59,679
low Leaf to Bud ratio plants because

1283
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,599
it's like honestly what's fixed in the

1284
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,879
genan pool more than anything else you

1285
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,920
know it's almost like a new Baseline

1286
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,920
yeah exactly it's the new skunk

1287
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:14,000
one and so um it's a it's just it's good

1288
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,280
it's a good structure it P it passes it

1289
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
because it's so fixed but you know um

1290
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,079
that's why kind of what I was inferring

1291
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,960
earlier on by like oh it's easy to fix

1292
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:26,079
secondary traits it's not easy if it's

1293
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,880
like you know a rarity in a jean pool

1294
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,559
but like in AR jeene pool that most

1295
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,318
people work in it's uh it's it's all

1296
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,480
fixed for you and so that's what I meant

1297
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,639
by

1298
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,000
that local you're a academic type

1299
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,318
academic young man AR sh do you like at

1300
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,838
University and the things that you've

1301
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:45,719
learned about selection so you know

1302
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:46,838
going all the way back to like um what's

1303
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,000
his

1304
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:51,199
name what the do with the [ __ ] P's

1305
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,199
name

1306
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:58,200
again yeah man

1307
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:59,880
the yeah um yeah going back to that do

1308
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:01,719
you find any of that applicable to to

1309
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,720
the breeding that you do like are you

1310
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:07,199
you know leaning on academic [ __ ] for

1311
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:07,199
that or what

1312
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:14,039
um in a way not really

1313
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,240
um

1314
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,279
like I don't know there there's just so

1315
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:22,279
many genes at play that it doesn't

1316
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,440
really apply but like I think there

1317
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,280
still is like

1318
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:32,400
um you can kind of achieve an F1 you

1319
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:34,480
know if you properly select the

1320
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,680
parents

1321
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:41,000
um but I I haven't gotten that far to

1322
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,759
like have two true true breeding parents

1323
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,480
you

1324
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,799
know

1325
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:52,119
um but I don't know I'm kind of just

1326
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:55,000
looking for good weed man and like yeah

1327
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:58,480
breeding can fix traits to do that but

1328
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,480
like at the end of it

1329
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:05,040
like you know good weed is good weed

1330
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:07,119
right um so I was interested to ask you

1331
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,679
because everyone will obviously see own

1332
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,280
by this chat I know [ __ ] all about

1333
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:11,558
breeding and genetics and all that kind

1334
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,760
of stuff so I was interested to see

1335
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:14,519
someone that actually has like learned

1336
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,319
this kind of stuff if you find that any

1337
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:18,679
of the academic literature is relevant

1338
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,318
to to breeding cannabis just at home but

1339
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:22,960
but I find the whole thing I

1340
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,838
actually oh sorry oh yeah no go brother

1341
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,880
go for

1342
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,960
it um we actually like basically had a

1343
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,760
whole episode on like the science and

1344
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,039
what we felt the limits were in

1345
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,079
application it's probably worth like

1346
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:37,159
rehashing a little bit of it local just

1347
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:42,000
did touch on it slightly like Mendel's

1348
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:43,798
model uh of heritability does depend on

1349
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,798
like certain conditions ideal conditions

1350
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:49,559
being in place right like you actually

1351
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:53,000
knowing which uh Al's map to which like

1352
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:56,920
traits uh which

1353
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,798
um like whether it's like a a proper F1

1354
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,519
leading to sorry proper like IBL parents

1355
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:04,440
leading to a proper F1 which leads to a

1356
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:07,759
proper F2 Generation which often we

1357
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,480
don't really get I feel like in in

1358
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,680
cannabis and then we mentioned a whole

1359
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,798
bunch of other things as well like there

1360
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,199
are these other strange things where

1361
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:16,239
what is it like one trait can be

1362
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:20,399
controlled by multiple

1363
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:22,318
genes um or or one gene being linked to

1364
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,440
multiple traits is that possible as well

1365
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,880
I feel like both of those are possible

1366
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,119
yeah well like people the the scale is

1367
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,880
kind of what people fail to like realize

1368
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,760
is that like I was doing some um reading

1369
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,119
on some Gene correlation studies with

1370
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,680
reversals and it's like 12,000 different

1371
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,599
genes that are activated during the

1372
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,318
reversal process that aren't active

1373
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,760
during flowering and each one of those

1374
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:48,000
um has like on average 12 different

1375
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,680
alals or versions of that Gene and So

1376
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,960
like um they're it's it's like

1377
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:56,318
incomprehensibly complex you know local

1378
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,639
did you have to do like taxon

1379
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:02,960
um and like I plant ID when you were in

1380
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:04,719
college um so that those kind of classes

1381
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,358
were actually like kind of done being

1382
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,159
offered because a lot of the boty

1383
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:10,920
professors were like kind of on their

1384
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:14,519
way out yeah they're always retiring and

1385
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,798
like right and taxonomy it's

1386
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:20,280
like I don't want to say it's a dying

1387
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:23,119
field but like it's not really relevant

1388
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:26,000
anymore sadly except for grasses grasses

1389
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:29,280
are the only thing I would have loved to

1390
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,280
do something like that but it mine was

1391
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,920
kind of more like um ecological models

1392
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,319
and [ __ ] like that yeah because I was I

1393
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,358
was actually just having a conversation

1394
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:42,000
the other day about how like I didn't

1395
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,318
learn anything about breeding Beyond

1396
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,519
mendal like I learned I took a bunch of

1397
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:49,279
genetics and evolution courses and like

1398
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:50,838
ecology courses and stuff but the the

1399
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,000
only thing that I feel like really helps

1400
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:56,358
me in like my breeding is like really

1401
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,960
was the the tax the taxonomy and the um

1402
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:02,558
plant ID and like developmental Anatomy

1403
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,318
because you get um you get like really

1404
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,519
used to identifying really really minute

1405
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:10,519
traits that are like sometimes not

1406
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,759
visible to the naked eye and like um

1407
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:14,920
that's like what's determining where you

1408
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,599
go next on the dichotomus key of like

1409
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,880
what you're looking at you know right

1410
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,559
and so I feel like that's like really a

1411
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,358
really good like training course for um

1412
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:26,200
trade identification because you're just

1413
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,239
honed in onto all these micro

1414
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:30,078
features that that's interesting that

1415
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:33,000
you bring that up cuz uh one of my

1416
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:37,559
professors she did a lot of like um what

1417
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,559
was it um like pedigree type analysis

1418
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:43,559
where she'd grow a lot of like um you

1419
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,680
know um crosses that she would make from

1420
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,720
you know different populations or cross

1421
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:51,719
within populations and kind of see what

1422
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:55,719
genes were coming from what specific

1423
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:57,759
population um and it it like when you do

1424
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:59,719
stuff like that you kind of do learn to

1425
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,559
pick up like those really minute traits

1426
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:05,118
that might not like be an end all be all

1427
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,000
answer but like you're like okay I know

1428
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,720
this characteristic I know that this

1429
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
will breed can breed for this you know

1430
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:15,759
type of deal

1431
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:21,199
deal um but if anything it was more like

1432
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:27,000
um learning models yeah what it is it

1433
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:27,000
it's nice to know um but it's not a sent

1434
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,079
yeah it's not like a whole piece like

1435
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:33,279
it's not a tool in the toolbx per se but

1436
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,039
just like a

1437
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,640
mindset right

1438
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,680
yeah and mendle got lucky people always

1439
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:43,960
forget about that like he was looking at

1440
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:48,078
like the perfect plant breeding model

1441
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:50,039
possible of like like real simple

1442
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,000
dominant recessive jeans and like a

1443
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,119
plant that's like an obligate in Crosser

1444
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,039
unless you like open up the flowers I

1445
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:58,160
don't know if there was luck I think he

1446
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:00,200
it was intentional right like he chose I

1447
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,118
I don't know

1448
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:04,838
man but yeah yeah that's true it could

1449
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,838
have been intentional I I haven't I

1450
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:09,880
haven't read it referenced that way

1451
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:11,719
but well I think that's always what's

1452
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,240
interesting about any application of

1453
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:16,519
Science and we talked about this on your

1454
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:18,759
episode too where like the construction

1455
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:21,239
of the model and then testing the model

1456
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,240
is like one thing but checking the

1457
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,318
models fit to reality is not the same

1458
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:28,719
thing um yeah yeah

1459
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,960
exactly

1460
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,279
yeah yeah I mean that's that's

1461
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,559
definitely the kind of question I would

1462
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,480
love to ask someone like Chimera if you

1463
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:41,319
know if and when we get him on because

1464
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,358
it's even aention for me in producing an

1465
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:45,318
episode with him where I'm like I'm sure

1466
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,558
he could tell us a lot but it's like how

1467
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:50,920
much of it is just out of theoretical

1468
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:53,319
interest for most of us versus like

1469
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,720
stuff with like practical implications

1470
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:58,920
for us uh

1471
00:56:55,719 --> 00:57:01,199
um you know us people at home so to

1472
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,599
speak yeah yeah there's a lot of really

1473
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,279
cool theoretical and like like

1474
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,798
technically achievable stuff that yeah

1475
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,200
that just doesn't have any real

1476
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:11,000
application to like further anything but

1477
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:12,439
it is really cool like I've designed a

1478
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,798
bunch of experiments like that they're

1479
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,240
just like absolutely worthless probably

1480
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:19,199
wouldn't work but they're like a really

1481
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:21,000
cool theoretical

1482
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,759
concept yeah I mean like this is a

1483
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,400
little detour here my peps but like from

1484
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,440
your experience

1485
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,760
breeding and selecting on those

1486
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,159
commercial scales like have there been

1487
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,440
lessons you've been able to take

1488
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:37,159
home yeah the genan pool's way more

1489
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,599
narrow than most people think that's

1490
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:40,960
like what always like is just like

1491
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:43,119
smashing me in the face is because like

1492
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,280
you get a new marketed name and you grow

1493
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,599
it out and you look at it and you're

1494
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,440
like oh it's just this slightly reworked

1495
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:52,119
or reflavored you know and so it's

1496
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,440
actually hard to get diversity outside

1497
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:56,440
of the Sea World you know isn't that

1498
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,400
because of like the particular playing

1499
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,159
field that you're in it is yeah yeah I

1500
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,480
mean but it's kind of like I don't know

1501
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:04,440
it's been hammered on this show a

1502
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,240
million times just like that the genan

1503
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,119
pool's kind of you know like in trouble

1504
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:11,318
as far as like the way that it was

1505
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:13,240
legalized made it to where you know like

1506
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:15,038
the nurseries want to Mom up something

1507
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,879
that's going to sell and so they pick 12

1508
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,039
or 15 things that they think will sell

1509
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,798
and what sells right now is like candy

1510
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:25,920
gas Purple OG structure and so like

1511
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:29,838
there's economic forces like selecting

1512
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,838
the genan pool right now which is really

1513
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,798
stupid yep yep yep I think yeah you're

1514
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:38,239
right it's very shorted this narrative

1515
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:40,318
well yeah yeah it's nothing that hasn't

1516
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:43,038
been said on here I feel like a parrot

1517
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,239
so you no no no no no not at all I mean

1518
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,079
like that is those are the conditions

1519
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:49,318
that we are facing and so it's hard to

1520
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,480
ignore them when yeah like you said like

1521
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:53,239
smacking you in the face every day but

1522
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,199
then like whenever I've been to a new

1523
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:58,439
state that's been legalized cuz like we

1524
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,558
always tried to be their first is uh um

1525
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,440
you get a lot of cool cuts that kind of

1526
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,079
just CRP up from all these people that

1527
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,318
are just like hey I've got this and

1528
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:10,160
there so you know like Regional diet of

1529
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:11,880
weed um but there's no provenance to any

1530
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,000
of it you know what I mean and so it's

1531
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,358
like oh did I really have that or was it

1532
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,679
just this weird oneoff thing you know

1533
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:20,279
like I saw some stuff like that in

1534
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,798
Oklahoma like this dude like showed me

1535
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,760
some weed and it was all lime green he's

1536
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:25,559
like I call it Mountain Dew and it kind

1537
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,880
of had this like I don't know it had a

1538
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,760
soda sweet smell to it you know um but

1539
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,680
never heard of it never seen it again

1540
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,599
and so like there is pockets of

1541
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,440
diversity it's just like we need good

1542
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:41,440
caretakers kind of

1543
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,440
thing

1544
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,280
amen um well we this is funny like so

1545
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,798
the next section I I had in mind is kind

1546
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,680
of looping back again honestly it's it's

1547
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:56,358
I called it evaluation and decision-

1548
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:58,440
making and I suppose like this is this

1549
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:00,519
is kind of after you've gotten all your

1550
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,960
information right all your data sets are

1551
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:04,759
there you've flowered and I I presume

1552
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,159
like harvested and tested

1553
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,119
everything and you're at the point now

1554
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,960
where you're having to make those

1555
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,280
choices of like what to keep and whatnot

1556
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,960
to keep I mean we've sort of been

1557
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,480
talking about this the whole time right

1558
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,480
this is this is selection already so I

1559
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,519
don't know is there anything else you

1560
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,679
want to like talk about again while

1561
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:25,159
we're here um anything that's come up

1562
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,480
for people since we started talking

1563
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:27,480
about

1564
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,319
this I mean like it's all that that this

1565
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,639
is the part where like you're going to

1566
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:37,599
really enjoy having your notes you know

1567
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:39,400
what I mean because when I'm smoking

1568
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,440
something I like to look I like to read

1569
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,960
my cultivation notes while I'm smoking

1570
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,280
something and writing down the smoke

1571
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,880
notes you know um and so uh I'm actually

1572
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,880
more curious about like the criteria

1573
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:55,760
other than like yeah that's fire um that

1574
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,559
Matt and local are both um like how are

1575
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,440
you thinking about it because like I'll

1576
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:01,319
always have like a few decisions where

1577
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,318
like obviously there's the one that was

1578
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:05,000
like the strongest and there's usually

1579
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:06,558
the one that was the tastiest but is

1580
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,280
there anything that ever like sticks out

1581
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,599
to you guys that you guys are like oh I

1582
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,960
don't I don't know why but I have to

1583
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,200
keep this for this reason I mean like

1584
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,199
for me for

1585
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:19,038
example things that like to like grow

1586
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:20,719
themselves essentially is a it's a

1587
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:25,640
really nice

1588
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:27,118
um trait for me uh I don't know why but

1589
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:29,960
I'm kind of just

1590
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,480
like at this point a little convinced

1591
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,960
that things that you grow better are

1592
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:38,280
ultimately can express better so it's

1593
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,480
like when I'm selecting something that

1594
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,240
grows a lot better for me I feel like

1595
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:46,039
I'm ultimately going to get the more

1596
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:49,399
true to expression and it's not like my

1597
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:52,400
weed doesn't ever get me high you know

1598
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:55,440
what I mean like I don't know I get you

1599
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,200
know it all works

1600
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,159
um

1601
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,399
and you know like for example like the E

1602
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:05,239
appy stuff I thought a lot of the highs

1603
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,318
were all there but it's just like it

1604
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:12,199
comes down to like what is going to grow

1605
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:13,358
the best for me what do I want to keep

1606
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:17,199
around the

1607
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:19,759
most but it it becomes hard because

1608
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:23,798
like you know you have that whole fomo

1609
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,640
thing uh yeah for sure um it's like you

1610
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:29,239
know when when you get rid of something

1611
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:31,278
you're almost like kind of second

1612
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:33,000
guessing yourself cuz you're not sure

1613
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:34,639
what was lost like you don't know what

1614
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,960
you can't get

1615
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:40,118
back it's like how long do you keep it

1616
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,480
you know yeah exactly at this stage and

1617
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:44,640
then yeah how many how many cards do I

1618
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,199
want to keep as I said before like if

1619
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,719
you've got a line and you've got like

1620
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:49,118
four sort of relatively different

1621
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:50,639
expressions and you're a fan of all of

1622
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,119
them like you just hang on to everything

1623
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,480
or you like recombining those fenos in

1624
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:57,318
an attempt to you know what I mean

1625
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,679
create something that's even better in

1626
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:01,239
combinations it's interesting like where

1627
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,798
do you go from there and I like I tend

1628
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:04,838
to hang on to stuff probably longer than

1629
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,440
I should like I have like two or three

1630
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:08,358
things and I'm just still whittling it

1631
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,159
down and cutting hairs and at that stage

1632
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:11,440
I'll start asking friends and I'll be

1633
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:12,838
like all right which one do you like out

1634
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,440
of that and you know what I mean like if

1635
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:17,119
I if I really can't can't get to a

1636
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,119
logical conclusion myself about it and

1637
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,559
um yeah so of also it's like where do

1638
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,480
you go from there it's the next step

1639
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,839
like is this the epitome of this line is

1640
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,760
this like where I want to with this

1641
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:28,078
plant do I want to try and maybe get

1642
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,480
another packet of seeds and see if I can

1643
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,318
find something better than that and yeah

1644
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,039
it's the fomo thing too and I guess it's

1645
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:35,759
a little bit of imposter syndrome even

1646
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:38,480
like looping back to the start with

1647
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,039
exposure like you and me thousand um and

1648
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,679
even local to an extent not being in

1649
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:42,960
California but like you and me you know

1650
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:45,399
what I mean we haven't been exposed to a

1651
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,519
lot of these things so I have I've been

1652
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,278
to Amsterdam I've tried you know a

1653
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:52,318
couple of decent hazes and stuff over

1654
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:53,760
there and other cuts um but for the most

1655
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:57,000
part like you know I haven't smoked the

1656
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,440
real Sour or I haven't smoked like noog

1657
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,719
any of these baselines really so you

1658
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,318
know I'm keeping it I'm like the you

1659
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:06,000
know obviously I'm keeping it for myself

1660
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:08,199
but you know I like to think of like I

1661
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,798
know myself as a bit of a seed saver too

1662
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:11,118
like I've got a large collection and I

1663
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:13,199
want to you know keep it around not just

1664
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,640
for myself but for others as well so

1665
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,078
when I'm thinking about like you know

1666
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:18,798
selecting something or hanging on to

1667
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:21,039
something I'm like [ __ ] is this even

1668
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,759
worth it like you know I might like it

1669
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,640
but you know is it worth like just

1670
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,079
getting rid of this so I can focus my on

1671
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,118
popping more packs of seeds to find

1672
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,680
something even better like I guess not

1673
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:32,519
having that um exposure to that stuff

1674
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:34,960
like you know you sort of set your own

1675
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:37,559
baselines and then yeah it's interesting

1676
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,679
oh definitely man like I it's funny when

1677
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,640
when Dan was talking about in a way I

1678
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,399
guess how jaded he was with the Jean

1679
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:48,159
Pool I had to also had I had a moment of

1680
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,960
being like you know I'm so far from that

1681
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:52,838
right cuz I I just haven't seen haven't

1682
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,798
seen any of that

1683
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:58,318
um and so so even like right now I'm

1684
01:04:55,798 --> 01:05:02,599
running uh Blazer Panda's born in the

1685
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:06,558
purple which is a T1000 from CSI humble

1686
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:08,760
uh and uh Underdog URL also from CSI but

1687
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,920
Panda selection and it's my first

1688
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,920
encounter with like an URL OG

1689
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,400
combination and an URL like full stop

1690
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,480
it's nice and I know that it is nice but

1691
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,559
I also can kind of see through it I can

1692
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,798
see in it I guess

1693
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,760
like where people have taken that since

1694
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:28,079
you know we want to consider o OG

1695
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,000
probably being like a a component of

1696
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,519
some of what's Happening back like way

1697
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,519
upstream and it is fascinating to kind

1698
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:39,358
of get these like snapshots uh of where

1699
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:41,639
things have been and gone or like where

1700
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:43,199
things have come from because prior to

1701
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:47,358
this I was also doing like you know TKS

1702
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:48,838
s1's 91 S1 KMD hybrids just to kind of

1703
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:52,838
like yeah start working my way through

1704
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,719
some of those names um and it is a very

1705
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:58,558
different experience I have to say for

1706
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:02,038
sure um uh and like you said as well you

1707
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,278
know in a way it is a bit of a gift too

1708
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:05,119
because we're not as

1709
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:08,318
constrained right by either like the

1710
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,960
market or taste or like

1711
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:13,318
fashion

1712
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,920
um but yeah definitely interesting yeah

1713
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:19,440
no myars over there I

1714
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,880
imagine no oh [ __ ] plenty of Myas dude

1715
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,480
just full of yeah

1716
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,559
damn that an easy one to bring over

1717
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,039
right like yeah I guess so yeah that

1718
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:30,480
part that's the easy part you're

1719
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,920
probably closer to where the myars are

1720
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,798
getting made than I

1721
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,760
am oh man good point yeah probably flies

1722
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:42,519
fewer miles here yeah yeah

1723
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,119
um yeah man it's uh I think the T1000 is

1724
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:46,920
probably

1725
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:48,960
like it's probably one of the places I

1726
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,720
would tell people to go if they were

1727
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,039
looking for like better or like

1728
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:55,838
healthier or just like reinvigorated

1729
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:57,640
versions that would still hit that

1730
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:58,920
modern appeal you know what I mean

1731
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:00,639
because it is the base of like

1732
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,079
everything that we look at in some

1733
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:06,679
convoluted way um yeah and so just but

1734
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,880
just imagine if that's all you ever

1735
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:13,000
saw at the same time you

1736
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,278
know um when I try it I'm like I can see

1737
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,639
how nice this is but I'm like I can also

1738
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:21,480
see myself getting quite tired of this

1739
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:24,480
as well you know yeah yeah and like it

1740
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,159
it's fixed you know it's truly fixed and

1741
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,440
so um I don't know I'm just kind of

1742
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:31,598
tired of smelling those creamy Anis

1743
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,119
Aromas they're good I still like them

1744
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:37,559
there's always a place in my heart for

1745
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:40,838
some Sunset sh um but um past that I

1746
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:40,839
kind of think that's where it peaked

1747
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:47,119
honestly slightly tangential but um

1748
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,679
brings up interesting point that spindle

1749
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,519
made yesterday in the Discord about like

1750
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:54,879
potentially making a new clone only you

1751
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:56,639
know so it's weird like 90% of the [ __ ]

1752
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,798
well I won't go that far but aside from

1753
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,598
cookies and stuff like that but you know

1754
01:07:57,798 --> 01:08:01,038
what I mean 90% of the [ __ ] that was

1755
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,720
kept around seems to be like from the

1756
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,200
'90s early 2000s with like all the hazes

1757
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:06,358
and diesels and kushers and Chim and

1758
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,480
like that kind of stuff like the [ __ ]

1759
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:11,199
that was kept around in Clone form train

1760
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,440
R stuff like that um how would you even

1761
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,480
go about making a new clone only in this

1762
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,198
day and age with so you know what I mean

1763
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,479
like a million marketing channels and

1764
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:22,158
stuff like that to have to Wade

1765
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:24,039
through I think it was like uh I can't

1766
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,399
remember who I was talking to maybe it

1767
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:29,278
was local but um I was just like looking

1768
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:31,039
at like the modern jeane pool in that

1769
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,040
bottleneck and I drw a [ __ ] little

1770
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,960
diagram I'm like OG pers and then you

1771
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:38,880
know like just like the base you know

1772
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,880
like thin mint sherbet gelato everything

1773
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,400
we have now and I think the way to make

1774
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,798
something new is like more like what

1775
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:47,158
some of the homies on the server are

1776
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,439
doing and so I like I really like when I

1777
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:53,039
see things like um last episode we

1778
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,759
talked about pack and the um Santa Cruz

1779
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:57,039
wreck like like that's a really cool

1780
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:58,880
it's two clone onlies right but I think

1781
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,158
where like the real magic is bound to

1782
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,039
happen is that like that's an uncommon

1783
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:05,358
cross that I haven't really seen made

1784
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:07,119
before this and then you also get high

1785
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,560
and Lonesome and he grabs it and he

1786
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:11,719
takes that and Crosses it to the appy

1787
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,400
and like neither of those are really

1788
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:17,198
like they have maybe some elements in

1789
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:20,039
some Modern things but it's so outside

1790
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,719
the fold of the bottleneck that we see

1791
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:24,039
now because it's like an upside down

1792
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:25,719
triangle is how I view the modern gene

1793
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:27,359
pool and we kind of just like fold in

1794
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:29,399
some things from down below every now

1795
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,319
and then but it still comes down to a

1796
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:35,838
point where it was like one or two cuts

1797
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:38,640
um and so um being completely outside

1798
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,399
that gene pool and like going back to

1799
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,319
pedigree analysis you know what I mean

1800
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,960
like like you can look up enough of this

1801
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,199
stuff to make sure and just be like oh

1802
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:48,679
like this seems like an uncommon idea

1803
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:50,079
and I'm outside the primary gene pool

1804
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:52,239
that's like what people need to start

1805
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:54,158
doing and start adding some new trees to

1806
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:57,678
the forest instead of a new Branch to

1807
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:59,719
the family tree kind of thing I'll say

1808
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,880
that some of those Santa Cruz recks man

1809
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:05,600
look pretty [ __ ] zah like yeah on par

1810
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,560
with like modern blue dreams resin

1811
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,480
coated man when you grow it right and so

1812
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,560
like I can totally believe it and she

1813
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:13,119
gets dark or at least the Santa Cruz

1814
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,520
wreck some of them got pretty [ __ ]

1815
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:19,000
dark dude I've noticed that the Blue

1816
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,320
Dream throws purple with LED like uh

1817
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,840
pack and I have talked about that a

1818
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:24,119
little bit you get a lot more of that

1819
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,039
anthos cyan in production for some

1820
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:29,519
reason with LED over Sun grown or you

1821
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:33,719
know HPS

1822
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,600
huh I I wanted to okay I kind of want to

1823
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,520
signpost one thing I think we're kind of

1824
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,800
like leaving behind selection I think

1825
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,679
that's probably good I think we just

1826
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,360
open it up and just like we can all just

1827
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:44,800
talk about like what we're into in terms

1828
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:47,000
of like projects that hypothetical or

1829
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,880
real projects and and stuff like that

1830
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,158
and I wanted to prod local a little bit

1831
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,199
because you know he he now has like and

1832
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:54,359
I don't know how much I don't want to

1833
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,719
pressure him to like talk about if he

1834
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:58,799
doesn't want to but I feel like now he's

1835
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:00,039
kind of got a really interesting library

1836
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,039
and a really interesting kind of like

1837
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:04,319
pool of genetics to work with and I'm

1838
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:06,679
curious to know like you know what he's

1839
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:09,119
going to do um loo do you want to speak

1840
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:10,920
to anything about like what you you're

1841
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:14,599
thinking of maybe playing with in the

1842
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:18,560
future you can be vague if you want um

1843
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:21,920
or as detailed as you want to be um so

1844
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:24,440
yeah um right now like I don't have

1845
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,840
particularly anything in the works but

1846
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:29,319
I've been

1847
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:32,360
um working on reversing the sweet pee um

1848
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:35,000
cuz I'm I'm super set on it um I think

1849
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:38,000
it it has really great smoke quality and

1850
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,119
I I think that I can use that to my can

1851
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,479
you tell us about the lineage again just

1852
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:47,238
for the people who don't know what that

1853
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:49,638
is oh yeah so that sweet pee um so it uh

1854
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:55,000
comes from

1855
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:59,319
uh two um p91 s1s um two different ones

1856
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,119
that bitter um Bitter Sweet SD made um

1857
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:07,399
he made that like two and a half maybe

1858
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:10,639
three years ago um and I've grown about

1859
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:13,439
14 um and then there were two that I

1860
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:18,520
really liked um and now I have the one

1861
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:21,479
that I have but it I've I've had it like

1862
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:24,520
for going on three years now I want to

1863
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:25,879
say um what kind of plant is it what you

1864
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,800
know what does it smell like what how

1865
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,440
does it

1866
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,360
hait so um that that's that's the hard

1867
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:33,359
part it's

1868
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:41,679
uh it's kind of like a soapy in a way

1869
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:45,679
bright um at least my my specific sweet

1870
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:48,039
peac cut because uh not not all the p91

1871
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:51,158
stuff would smell like this um at least

1872
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:54,679
based off of the the sweet PE that I saw

1873
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:58,920
um but there's kind of like a a nice

1874
01:12:54,679 --> 01:13:01,279
soapy um bright note some slight n uh

1875
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:04,158
nutty kind of notes to it like a Savory

1876
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:08,000
kind of nuttiness and then there were

1877
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:12,439
some that had like a a leathery note to

1878
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:15,880
them but with that like kind of

1879
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:18,238
bright I don't want to say like um

1880
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,560
eucalyptus but more like camper or

1881
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:23,559
something like

1882
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:25,239
that yeah totally but it's it's it's

1883
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,880
really hard to describe the smell cuz

1884
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:29,638
it's not

1885
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:33,159
like it I can't really put words to it

1886
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:35,800
other than like in my cuts instance like

1887
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:37,039
that bright and soapy smell that's okay

1888
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,800
what about so you've obviously thought

1889
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:41,960
about what could complement it obviously

1890
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,679
or like or pose like a Counterpoint to

1891
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:49,359
it what what are your ideas or possible

1892
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:51,239
ideas um so uh so I guess we could take

1893
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:54,119
this to kind of like the primary and

1894
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:58,599
secondary thing like I I know for a fact

1895
01:13:54,119 --> 01:14:01,719
that it it's pretty damn strong um and

1896
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:05,000
now what I'm looking to do is uh kind of

1897
01:14:01,719 --> 01:14:10,920
either reduce the potency or like kind

1898
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,639
of um use it to like carry taste better

1899
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,079
if that makes sense so like something

1900
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:19,359
like the Death Star I would I would love

1901
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:22,679
to pull that off but um it's not looking

1902
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:25,000
too successful um but it would have been

1903
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:26,520
nice to kind of see what the sweet pee

1904
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,719
would have done with the Death Star in

1905
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:33,719
terms of kind of being able to carry

1906
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:36,560
that n like that rank taste

1907
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:39,560
um because I don't know we like that

1908
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,039
like it it does taste good but sometimes

1909
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:44,000
I don't think it carries the best if

1910
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:47,158
that makes sense I don't know like it

1911
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,639
it's it's hard to to put to words but

1912
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:51,479
kind of that super skunk stuff doesn't

1913
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:53,440
always taste the

1914
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:55,678
best yeah cuz I was going to actually

1915
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:57,799
ask you for just everyone like rounding

1916
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,079
out the historical context like the p91

1917
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,560
itself like you know what what is the

1918
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,960
vibe of the

1919
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:08,320
p91 um that's the thing is we don't know

1920
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,000
like it it throws I don't want to say it

1921
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:14,000
throws a lot but it throws enough to say

1922
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,920
that it's a poly hybrid of some

1923
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,039
sort um at least in my opinion because

1924
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:22,840
like you know the the C the sweet PE is

1925
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:26,639
like two S1 so relative like you would

1926
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,960
in Theory it would be like um relatively

1927
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:31,400
stable

1928
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:33,639
right um it was like in regards to the

1929
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:36,759
potencies and smells but like there was

1930
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:39,560
varying structures and you know that to

1931
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,000
me kind of points that there might be a

1932
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:45,280
little more behind it

1933
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,238
than you know some some may would think

1934
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,519
I don't

1935
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:53,759
know okay no that's really cool thanks

1936
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,679
for telling us about p91 I mean

1937
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,960
uh I also wanted to ask you about some

1938
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:59,480
of the nld stuff that you have also

1939
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,399
because I think then booze could also

1940
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:02,879
speak to some of that um and also want

1941
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:04,799
to hear from boo about what his plans

1942
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,800
are with some of those but Lo what yeah

1943
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,039
do you want to tell us about some of

1944
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,760
your nld stuff that you've got and what

1945
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:13,719
you might want to do or you might be

1946
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,400
trying so um like I've mentioned earlier

1947
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:17,719
I'm kind of a sucker for those Haze

1948
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:21,000
Spears so like the Band-Aid Haze number

1949
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:23,920
seven the E appy number 16 that I have

1950
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,679
the EA number 14 also does something

1951
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:30,840
similar to that um but the one thing the

1952
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:32,600
one I guess the one complaint not it's

1953
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,960
not even a complaint cuz it's kind of

1954
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,960
like a shitty complaint is like the way

1955
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,359
that the buds form on the sweet pee like

1956
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,760
I wish the buds were a little more

1957
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,880
elongated um but it would be nice to

1958
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,079
like you know take that structure from a

1959
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,960
haze and kind of implement it into sweet

1960
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:52,039
pee and you know kind of kind of see

1961
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:56,039
what comes out of something like that um

1962
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:58,119
or like cross something like a a haze or

1963
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:01,198
a narrow leaf type plant

1964
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:04,439
to like

1965
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:06,599
um let's see like a snow S1 or something

1966
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:09,439
like that or

1967
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:11,840
um yeah something of that nature kind of

1968
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:15,319
play with the idea of like doing that

1969
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:18,920
you know narrow broad to see if you get

1970
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:22,639
you know kind of heterosis if you will

1971
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,520
because ultimately um like if you're

1972
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,239
asking

1973
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,199
like me for like my breeding goals I'm

1974
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:31,519
going to want to create like a good

1975
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:35,000
amount of diversity so that I like the

1976
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:37,440
room is is Paramount like I I

1977
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,560
have like the the possibilities are

1978
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,839
endless that's kind of what I I would

1979
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:45,320
like to do for myself like in terms of

1980
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:48,319
hunting like it doesn't get boring Etc

1981
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:50,559
it might be harder to find things

1982
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:55,000
but that's like the beauty of it is

1983
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,000
being able to go through plants right

1984
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:05,079
absolutely booze did you want to speak

1985
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,800
to us nld stuff yeah yeah just before

1986
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:08,479
loc what are you cross on the sweet P2

1987
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,960
like you reversing it onto a bunch of

1988
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:11,799
your cuttings or you just like testing

1989
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,239
to see if it flipped or what's the point

1990
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:17,440
um so yeah I have uh so I have the Death

1991
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:20,279
Star in the tent I have the bandid ha

1992
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:22,519
number seven and I have the Santa Cruz

1993
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:25,399
wreck number six which was one of my

1994
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:28,880
favorite ones

1995
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:32,638
um some seeds are forming but not a lot

1996
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:35,960
like it's nothing too crazy but at least

1997
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:39,119
we know that the pollen does something

1998
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:41,279
right how many did you reverse uh just

1999
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:45,719
one at this point and I have a bunch in

2000
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:47,719
veg um you know ready to go it's just uh

2001
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:50,960
there are other things that I need to

2002
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:53,119
kind of prepare for in the future that

2003
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:57,279
you know may a reversal right now might

2004
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:58,800
not be like the best idea I don't know

2005
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,158
yeah I'm shot for time a little bit as

2006
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,159
well but [ __ ] I've already like

2007
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,279
flipped six and they're all throwing

2008
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,879
nuts so I'm like all right we're all in

2009
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:10,079
but um I got a cool Plant it's a thread

2010
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,480
cutter so it's uh the mom is I think

2011
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,119
similar to something you've grown the

2012
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:15,319
mom oh no it's similar to The Glass

2013
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:19,000
Onion that you just did thousand but

2014
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:20,840
it's um star fors the mom so it's uh

2015
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,359
what is it it's it's

2016
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:27,719
rubber yeah Kem DF and then gel onto

2017
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:30,639
that so I found one out of 18 that was

2018
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:32,880
uh my favorite in terms of effect and

2019
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:34,079
smell so it was runy compared to the

2020
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,960
others it's kind of weird it throws

2021
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:39,479
these big chunks on like little stick

2022
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,198
frames so not really like a cam or

2023
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,759
something that I'd expect to see but

2024
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:44,519
yeah out of all of them it kind of grew

2025
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,800
almost like a vine to start off with

2026
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,360
compared to some of the other like more

2027
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,719
robust indicas but throws like really

2028
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:53,559
good resin fantastic High and um yeah it

2029
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:55,000
seems to like other [ __ ] in the T have

2030
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,760
been a little bit affected by mites this

2031
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
round like I've had a drama just like

2032
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,600
with inspections and that having to um

2033
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,880
bring stuff outside and then bring it

2034
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,639
back in so I've like got a couple of

2035
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,079
pest concerns and they don't seem to

2036
01:20:03,639 --> 01:20:07,560
really be getting any damage so I've um

2037
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,519
I've reversed some of them because I've

2038
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,280
got a couple of sativa Cuts in the

2039
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,320
Arsenal from my mate uh as well as a

2040
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:16,800
I've got a starm MOX cutting that's from

2041
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:19,559
another buddy that's like starg cross to

2042
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,360
Mal Harkin and the thing with that is

2043
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,760
the the mock which is the uh being

2044
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,639
reversed on to the stong in this

2045
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,880
instance uh it appears to be super

2046
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:28,279
dominant cuz even though it's been

2047
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,520
reversed onto a bunch of indicas you're

2048
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:33,920
still getting like 14 to 15 week fenos

2049
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,719
popping up it's just uh I'm interested

2050
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,119
to see how that will cross to this Inda

2051
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:40,960
plant because the mock the star MOX it's

2052
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:43,319
throwing like pretty decent Siz buds as

2053
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,800
well but nothing like chunking out like

2054
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,079
the the thread cutter so Crossing this

2055
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,639
uh something that's on like a bit of a

2056
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:51,119
lankier frame um that's supporting large

2057
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:52,920
flowers like the thread cutter onto

2058
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,719
something that's on like a you you a

2059
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,880
much more sturdy frame and throwing like

2060
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,119
a more spear-like but I'm interested to

2061
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,760
see how those two will go together but

2062
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:02,238
um breeding sativas together is

2063
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,280
something that I'm super interested in

2064
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:05,839
going forward uh I haven't really done a

2065
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:07,679
lot of it to be honest like I've just

2066
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,639
been in the popping seed stage but made

2067
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,600
of M local bird seed he's done a really

2068
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:14,039
interesting run uh recently he's used

2069
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,560
like a TV mail from bod and crossed it

2070
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:19,279
onto three cuting that he has so the

2071
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:24,920
ISAC Hayes which is from Yos Sami that's

2072
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:26,759
that um a G13 cross to a C5 F2 of sorts

2073
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:29,440
and then what else he's got he's got a

2074
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:31,719
Band-Aid hay3 and then Harlem dreams

2075
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:35,519
which is like a blue dream cross to a pi

2076
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:36,520
S1 so by Crossing them onto the the TV

2077
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,840
it's interesting because you don't

2078
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,239
really see a lot of people doing these

2079
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,079
sativa hybrids like a bit more now you

2080
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:43,959
know obviously it's like a seeds and bod

2081
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:46,319
and stuff like that but when you think

2082
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,279
like in the 80s a lot of the magic that

2083
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,840
um came over to Amsterdam was like you

2084
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:51,679
know from the haze and the skunk and

2085
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,960
stuff like that which featured you know

2086
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,560
some pretty crazy equatorial land races

2087
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,359
so it's just interesting to you know now

2088
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,360
that a lot of diversity has been sort of

2089
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:02,719
lost to an extent and a lot of people

2090
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:05,000
are playing around just in a a smaller

2091
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,239
gene pool it'd be cool to see like

2092
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,600
what's been left behind so to speak you

2093
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:12,678
know see what like a Colombian cross to

2094
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,039
uh Angola red does or even some of the

2095
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:16,039
the older stuff from Neville and

2096
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:18,279
Crossing That Into You know some of this

2097
01:22:16,039 --> 01:22:20,719
more um rural land race stuff and just

2098
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:23,000
see what pops out of it that's what I'm

2099
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:25,399
super interested in and like granted I

2100
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,560
don't think it's an easy path like it's

2101
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,079
I think it's pretty easy to you know get

2102
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,199
a couple of packets of seeds these days

2103
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:33,079
and make something that's pretty

2104
01:22:30,198 --> 01:22:35,559
phenomenal like breeding is has kind of

2105
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:36,960
been simplified by the am sheer amount

2106
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,239
of people that are making seeds and

2107
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,279
working with good things like in the 80s

2108
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:41,959
when there was only a couple of people

2109
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:44,119
doing it you know it was kind of a

2110
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,079
crapshoot um so to speak you know

2111
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:46,920
because you have just numbers alone you

2112
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:48,679
know what I mean like you're working

2113
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,840
with such less numbers but now that

2114
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:51,039
there's you know so many people in

2115
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,239
America working with clones and

2116
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:55,639
collectives like I don't think it's that

2117
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:57,919
hard to to find good plants uh in you

2118
01:22:55,639 --> 01:23:00,279
know these cultivated varieties so going

2119
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,158
back to like land races and earlier you

2120
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:03,399
know Regional cultiv eyeses I think

2121
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:05,279
that's where it's it's going to we're

2122
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:08,000
going to be able to find these um really

2123
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:10,479
unique highs and on that line as well

2124
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,520
like with my jerus one that I've got you

2125
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:13,919
know I think that's a pretty unique old

2126
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,840
school line as well you know [ __ ]

2127
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,520
Herms like something would and it's got

2128
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:21,520
a fantastic nose and if it is like some

2129
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,880
Hindu Kush like from the 80s or 90s you

2130
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,159
know either from Neville or from um

2131
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,679
someone else that had imported it or you

2132
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:29,879
know perhaps locally like from

2133
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,199
Washington or whatever um you know I

2134
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,800
think that could be cool to inject into

2135
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:35,399
some of these sativas as well you know

2136
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,719
kind of like doing a F1 hybrid of sorts

2137
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:38,759
kind of like Neville did with the nl5 so

2138
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:40,039
yeah that's something that I want really

2139
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,800
want to do going forward too you know

2140
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:44,000
once I've busted into some of these you

2141
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:46,320
know packets from White Buffalo and

2142
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,840
Wally duck and some of these other cats

2143
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:51,238
um yeah find some cool fenos and put

2144
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:54,319
something like the the Jagger onto that

2145
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,599
or an urk or a um purple indor or

2146
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:58,439
something like

2147
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,400
that I think one one high level

2148
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:02,599
reflection that I have here listening to

2149
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:04,759
all of you is like there' have been kind

2150
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,199
of suggestions from for like different

2151
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:10,000
tactics for or strategies perhaps for

2152
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:13,799
achieving novelty or like

2153
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:18,000
achieving uh something that is you know

2154
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,560
not subject to the same uh I don't know

2155
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,039
uh constraints as like some of the more

2156
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,920
hyped stuff right whether that's like

2157
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:27,000
going a little bit further Upstream to

2158
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:30,158
some of the like uh older Elites like

2159
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,719
the blue dream and train wreck going

2160
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:35,960
even further Upstream to you know yeah

2161
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:38,679
like bro is saying land Racers Regional

2162
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,480
cultivar um or just kind of being

2163
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:44,639
adjacent right like going sideways

2164
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:47,079
perhaps a bit more as well um and yeah

2165
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,480
that's you know that I I find like

2166
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:50,439
thinking about it on that level quite

2167
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:53,678
interesting too where you have this like

2168
01:24:50,439 --> 01:24:55,799
huge possibility space and you can like

2169
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,480
or graph maybe and you like go up or

2170
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:02,639
down or you go you know

2171
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:05,718
sideways um I find that stuff really

2172
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:09,118
interesting yeah I think it's uh I think

2173
01:25:05,719 --> 01:25:11,560
that there's not a lot new I think you

2174
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:13,158
every now and then I see something novel

2175
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,159
come out but it'll be like something

2176
01:25:13,158 --> 01:25:16,879
really small and not it's because I'm

2177
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:19,759
searching so hard to find something

2178
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,679
interesting to look at you know um but I

2179
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,920
really like I agree with Matt I think a

2180
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:27,480
lot of people are going to have to start

2181
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,079
taking some of these um the honestly

2182
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:31,039
just the oldest Cuts you can find that

2183
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:32,880
are still good and don't have that

2184
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:36,238
aren't you know like you know row shaded

2185
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,159
glasses type Cuts like um and we're

2186
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,000
going to have to you know start Crossing

2187
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,759
those out with other things that um

2188
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,679
aren't common either and that's like the

2189
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:48,360
only way we're going to find um anything

2190
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:50,679
new and exciting that new Elite cut you

2191
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:51,960
know like I have no idea what it'll be

2192
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:53,880
but like I definitely know when

2193
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,279
something things like when I look at

2194
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:59,520
something and I'm like oh that's kind of

2195
01:25:55,279 --> 01:26:00,800
played out you know and so uh um I'm

2196
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,520
really we were talking about this before

2197
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,440
we started recording was like I'm really

2198
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,360
interested in old Mexican Cuts I know

2199
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:09,599
it's kind of a pipe dream or Mexican

2200
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:12,039
seeds is uh um that's kind of seems to

2201
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:15,079
be where a lot of the magic from like

2202
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:17,238
the seed bank days and you know uh with

2203
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:19,519
a lot of varieties like that Mexican

2204
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:21,319
seemed to be kind of a perfect Middle

2205
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,159
Ground between really really long

2206
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:25,479
flowering and something that's like

2207
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:27,599
manageable in the Northern Hemisphere

2208
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:30,959
and then also has like those nuanced

2209
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,440
flavors and highs and expressions um I

2210
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,920
mean I'm sure that comes with a ton of

2211
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:35,519
Herms that's kind of what I've seen from

2212
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,800
Land race stuff when you try and work

2213
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,239
with it it's lots lots of Herms that

2214
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,159
goes back to Matt just being like it's

2215
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:42,519
not an easy path but I think it is the

2216
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:46,679
path that we're going to have to take to

2217
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:50,480
find exciting things that aren't kind of

2218
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:53,480
um just redundant and you know kind of

2219
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:55,519
tropes at this point

2220
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:57,039
any other thoughts on like possible

2221
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,960
directions that could be taken from any

2222
01:26:57,039 --> 01:27:00,800
of

2223
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:03,279
you I do think that someone recently

2224
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:06,159
told me that there seems to be like a

2225
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:08,599
few types of cuts um like the white

2226
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:09,920
being one of them where like when you

2227
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:13,520
cross it with

2228
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,800
something the the profiles in the plant

2229
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,960
seem to be more than the sum of its

2230
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:21,520
parts and there doesn't seem to be a lot

2231
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,880
of examples of these um but we like like

2232
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,159
you know

2233
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,079
what's funny about the white is it's

2234
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:29,960
kind of just like a really resin coated

2235
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:33,600
odorless aromal OG type you know what I

2236
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:35,800
mean but like it seems to like make

2237
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,880
really interesting Aromas in its progeny

2238
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,320
and I don't really know what that's from

2239
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,079
but I think it's something that people

2240
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:43,439
need to be looking out for

2241
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:46,439
more I mean is it a

2242
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:48,399
naive uh assumption for me to be like oh

2243
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:51,759
it's obviously a recessive trait of some

2244
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:53,118
kind um I I would assume yeah yeah or

2245
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,800
even just just something that like

2246
01:27:53,118 --> 01:27:57,839
there's types of genes that need to be

2247
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,760
outcrossed to like Express and you know

2248
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,119
just because something's fixed in a gene

2249
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:05,760
pool well like the homogeneous

2250
01:28:02,118 --> 01:28:07,679
combination may be like not great but

2251
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,920
then you know when it's crossed out with

2252
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,279
something then it can express in the

2253
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,480
desirable way and so I think people need

2254
01:28:12,279 --> 01:28:16,439
to get away from the idea that like a

2255
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:19,959
dominant trait or a fixed trait in a

2256
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:24,238
population is always a good thing you

2257
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:25,359
know oh I have a I have a bit of a uh I

2258
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:26,759
don't know what you'd call this kind of

2259
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:29,759
question maybe I don't know if it's

2260
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:32,159
silly but I another another way for me

2261
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,400
to ask something like this is also like

2262
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,519
are there particular smell or flavor

2263
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:38,559
profiles that we

2264
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,239
haven't either come across here or

2265
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,360
haven't been like Po popularized yet uh

2266
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:46,158
or that are more rare than others that

2267
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:46,158
you guys are interested

2268
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:53,840
in I think the plant's honestly capable

2269
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:55,679
of doing all of them from what I've seen

2270
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,960
you know I've been surprised by stuff

2271
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,319
you know um but like I can't really

2272
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,319
think of something that I don't think

2273
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:04,198
would be like possible you know because

2274
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:07,279
like what it seems to me like is that

2275
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:09,719
like um just like cannabinoids a lot of

2276
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:11,399
like Turpin and aromatic compounds have

2277
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:13,039
like multiple versions of them and

2278
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:15,679
that's almost like the evolution of the

2279
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:17,719
prevalence of like a compound in a gene

2280
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:20,800
pool you know what I mean where it's

2281
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:22,520
like you can have different um

2282
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,600
prevalence of different

2283
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:28,760
um uh like isomers and types of like uh

2284
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,560
um like lyine or that's probably a bad

2285
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:33,239
example I'm not a chemist I'm not like

2286
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:37,000
super deep into scense science you know

2287
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:37,000
um but it

2288
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:42,559
um yeah like I think that we can get all

2289
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:44,800
of it it's just like when you have a

2290
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,920
narrow gene pool you get one thing you

2291
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,000
know and so if we can get that worldwide

2292
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,840
gene pool opened up again I've heard

2293
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,880
people describe all kinds of wild

2294
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:56,079
combinations from you know trips up into

2295
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:59,199
Nepal and stuff like that and Northern

2296
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:02,600
India and so I've never experienced that

2297
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:05,759
myself you know but like um spicy hashy

2298
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:08,079
fruity combos seem to be big and you

2299
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:11,199
know um I think it's just going to be

2300
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:13,198
more novel combinations of smells and

2301
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,399
Aromas more than like anything you

2302
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:17,599
haven't seen in weed

2303
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:20,879
before because we've got everything from

2304
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:23,840
garbage to to artificial grape candy you

2305
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,840
know

2306
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,198
I was who was I I think locco was on

2307
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,279
this conversation maybe you were there

2308
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:32,759
as well Dan I was I was asking I was

2309
01:30:30,279 --> 01:30:36,759
asking them

2310
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:38,880
um about uh fruit smells and how often

2311
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,159
they translate and which ones tend to

2312
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,600
and which ones don't so I know grape is

2313
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:46,479
probably quite a good one right in that

2314
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:49,920
it does tend to transfer from smell to

2315
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:51,879
flavor no I've seen it go both ways yeah

2316
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,079
I've seen it go both ways on the on the

2317
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:55,800
fruity stuff and it's almost seems to be

2318
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,158
like a prevalence of it like it like

2319
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,320
it's its own trait as whether the flavor

2320
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:02,399
translates or not because it's going to

2321
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:04,279
determine like the chemical form that

2322
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,198
that Aroma compound is in and like

2323
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:08,479
whether it's like surviving combustion

2324
01:31:06,198 --> 01:31:10,279
or not and it's like form that tastes

2325
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:13,319
good or if it's converted into a form

2326
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:14,800
that tastes good you know and so that's

2327
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:16,960
like a huge thing is there's a lot of

2328
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:20,760
stuff that's fruity that doesn't taste

2329
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:23,359
fruity and I don't think that's very

2330
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,280
desirable yeah yeah if it smells like a

2331
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:26,719
peach I want it to taste like a peach or

2332
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:27,719
something else equally as good you know

2333
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:30,840
what I mean it's kind of cool when

2334
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:33,399
flavors like um I don't know maybe you

2335
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:35,279
smell strawberry but you taste blueberry

2336
01:31:33,399 --> 01:31:36,920
or something like that some weird combo

2337
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:37,840
like that that could be really novel and

2338
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,920
really

2339
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,920
cool yeah yeah because I was going to

2340
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,399
say like blueberry is a good example I

2341
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,880
don't obviously we know because because

2342
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:48,359
we are associated with Matt obviously we

2343
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,400
know quite a bit about it but I feel

2344
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:54,519
like for the purposes of The Wider

2345
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:56,559
Market it's not that well recognized

2346
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,239
perhaps yeah it's kind of one of those

2347
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:00,239
common questions though that you get

2348
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:02,399
asked by people that are I mean maybe

2349
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,158
just at a certain tier in the industry

2350
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:06,638
but they're like oh it smells like that

2351
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:07,960
did it translate like it's definitely

2352
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,679
something that comes up in my

2353
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,920
conversations with work quite

2354
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:14,960
often local you know you were telling us

2355
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:19,199
about that like was it white gummy bear

2356
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:22,800
or uh you know smelling EA like does how

2357
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:25,638
how does that translate to flavor um

2358
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:28,639
um I would say it translates pretty well

2359
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:31,000
actually um I don't know if it's cuz

2360
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:34,359
like it I don't know it has like a

2361
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:38,079
really kind of wet oily

2362
01:32:34,359 --> 01:32:41,198
resin and maybe that kind of allows it

2363
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:43,198
to like carry really well but it it

2364
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,198
tastes just like it smells and then

2365
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:49,039
obviously like as you get towards the

2366
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:53,238
end it just turns into weed but it The

2367
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:56,238
Taste is definitely noticeable um

2368
01:32:53,238 --> 01:32:59,519
and I mean I I don't it doesn't get me

2369
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:05,359
any less High than the other one other

2370
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:05,360
ones um but I don't know it's I

2371
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:12,760
guess yeah it it's a hard one

2372
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:14,719
cuz I mean some of them don't taste as

2373
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:17,320
Amplified as that one like the number

2374
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:22,840
fours has the same smell but it doesn't

2375
01:33:17,319 --> 01:33:27,000
taste as like um volatile if that makes

2376
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:29,000
sense or like it's not as like flavorful

2377
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,479
as a number one but the smells are the

2378
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,198
same I had a followup question for both

2379
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:36,919
of you who are uh so Matt Matt boo is

2380
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:38,879
like um may may be unavailable for the

2381
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:42,399
rest of this chat we'll see how he goes

2382
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,800
but for now um for you two Dan and local

2383
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:48,638
uh I I had a question because when Matt

2384
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:50,719
Riot was doing his uh smoke reviews he's

2385
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:52,319
doing flower reviews for a bit for us

2386
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:55,118
and like what was interesting was

2387
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:57,039
obviously watching him uh smoke it in a

2388
01:33:55,118 --> 01:33:59,439
bong and then smoke it in a vape right

2389
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:02,760
oh sorry smoking you know Vape

2390
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,919
it I don't think local Vapes right local

2391
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,079
I mean do you Dan and like how do you

2392
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,000
how do you conceptualize that

2393
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:11,559
distinction I mean it's just like a

2394
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,158
difference in in heat really you know

2395
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:15,199
cuz like I remember when like the puff

2396
01:34:13,158 --> 01:34:17,000
Co first came around they actually like

2397
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:18,719
didn't get hot enough to combust your

2398
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,800
oil fully so you always had this just

2399
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,520
like pool of your last dab in there and

2400
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,000
the new ones are great the new ones like

2401
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:28,760
can do it um but like I've noticed like

2402
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,039
a lot of the vaporizers um they have

2403
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:33,920
this like popcor Flavor that comes with

2404
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:35,639
them and um I've never tried like the

2405
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,920
what what does he have like the V rip or

2406
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:39,279
whatever I don't even know what that

2407
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:42,520
thing is looks like he's free Bas and

2408
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:46,319
crack to me um but

2409
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:49,560
um I I don't know man um I have like a

2410
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:51,559
Pax three I think a little handheld dry

2411
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,119
flower vape and I really like it but

2412
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,960
it's definitely not for flavor it's for

2413
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:59,279
like ease of use and like so I don't

2414
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,520
feel like I'm like like I don't know

2415
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:03,000
inhaling liters of smoke into my lungs

2416
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,639
every day and then I'll get cancer and

2417
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,158
die you

2418
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:10,199
know um but um yeah they all all the

2419
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:12,799
Vapes that I've ever tried all kind of

2420
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:15,439
like in a way change the flavor and make

2421
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,920
it slightly worse because that popcorn

2422
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:21,118
flavor is still there but um um I

2423
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:22,880
wouldn't be skeptical to say that like

2424
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:25,000
some people enjoy it more I think that's

2425
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,000
more true for like the E dab rigs and

2426
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,800
stuff like that is that you get like

2427
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,560
really really excellent flavor because

2428
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,840
you can dial in that um temperature of

2429
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:36,679
your Banger just perfectly to the tenth

2430
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,679
of a digit you

2431
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:42,760
know

2432
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,479
yeah um yeah locco any thoughts on that

2433
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,480
that whole topic of like different

2434
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:49,599
consumption modes so I smoke primarily

2435
01:35:47,479 --> 01:35:52,718
out of glass now I mean that's literally

2436
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:55,600
all I smoke actually

2437
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:59,800
um

2438
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:03,360
and so I used to smoke joints

2439
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:05,719
only and what I've noticed is um it took

2440
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:08,479
me a while to like acclimate myself to

2441
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:13,239
the taste of like flow through glass but

2442
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:16,399
like it does taste better um but I don't

2443
01:36:13,238 --> 01:36:19,559
have a vape personally and I had the

2444
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:22,759
same like feelings about Vapes as Dan

2445
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,840
until I tried that rip that mat has mhm

2446
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,800
cuz like all the other ones did make the

2447
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,760
weed taste like popcorn like the first

2448
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,000
hit was great and then every like

2449
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:34,760
everything else after that was asked but

2450
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:37,118
that rip it like you actually get like a

2451
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,280
lot of the nuances like the the Death

2452
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:43,319
Star tasted really [ __ ] nice through

2453
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:45,000
that um I had a um afgi cross to appy

2454
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:47,118
that I tried through that that was also

2455
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,479
really nice

2456
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:54,759
um um what else yeah like I don't know I

2457
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:56,359
if I had like the setup for it I would

2458
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:59,840
totally get it I don't know what goes

2459
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:03,279
into it I've used it once and that's it

2460
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:06,600
but I don't know glass it's easy like I

2461
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:10,079
just feel like it's the most average

2462
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,719
measure of like what the consu like what

2463
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:12,880
people are going to smoke it as or how

2464
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:13,760
they're going to smoke it you know what

2465
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,359
I

2466
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,159
mean yeah and I think like it goes into

2467
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:19,880
like how you smoke too because like I

2468
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:22,319
know older people that just pack

2469
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,400
enormous bowls and they like want to

2470
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:27,158
pass it and like everyone's just smoking

2471
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,839
this charred ass bowl and I'm just like

2472
01:37:27,158 --> 01:37:31,479
it's disgusting you know what I mean

2473
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,840
like I've I don't really like smoke in

2474
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:35,319
groups very often you know what I mean

2475
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,880
like a lot of people I know smoke but

2476
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:40,399
they don't want to like sit around and

2477
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:42,840
Blaze um and so like when I'm packing my

2478
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,479
bowls like I pack snaps and I'm like I

2479
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,279
barely burn it you know like I don't

2480
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,479
want the plant material to really burn

2481
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:51,359
up that much like I want to burn all the

2482
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:53,198
resin heads and then like unpack like a

2483
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:57,359
partially charred pull and pack myself

2484
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:58,839
another fresh one you know and so um

2485
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,238
yeah if you you're not going to get that

2486
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:03,599
flavor if you're packing these massive

2487
01:38:01,238 --> 01:38:04,959
bowls and and taking multiple hits off

2488
01:38:03,599 --> 01:38:09,440
of it because it's getting cooked each

2489
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:11,760
time you know and so um how you smoke

2490
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:14,519
yeah even with like just in the category

2491
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:17,079
of like like combusting weed um there's

2492
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,599
so many like different little nuances

2493
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:20,880
that can like make or break your

2494
01:38:18,599 --> 01:38:21,920
experience and how much you enjoy it you

2495
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,039
know I

2496
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:27,239
mean yeah I I'll also comment the one

2497
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,840
thing that I did like about joints a lot

2498
01:38:27,238 --> 01:38:32,598
is that you know you have do have some

2499
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,599
development to the smoke like it's not

2500
01:38:32,599 --> 01:38:39,159
the same thing from start to finish like

2501
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:40,599
it has stages yeah which a bong is like

2502
01:38:39,158 --> 01:38:42,359
I I think it was thousand that was

2503
01:38:40,599 --> 01:38:44,920
saying it it's kind of just like a

2504
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:47,039
oneand done type of deal like it has no

2505
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,158
like like it just Peaks and then goes

2506
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:53,118
absolutely straight down from there

2507
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:53,118
exactly yeah yeah don't smoke the

2508
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:58,359
downhill but like uh see I don't really

2509
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,399
like joints and blunts that much anymore

2510
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:02,799
like I did when I was a more social

2511
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:06,279
smoker um but I I always say like the

2512
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,279
best hit on a joint is the dry

2513
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:13,000
hit yeah because you get great flavor

2514
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,639
for that just that little tube of paper

2515
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,279
and some ground up weed in it like you

2516
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:19,239
can like really really taste you know

2517
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:21,719
it's a different experience than like

2518
01:39:19,238 --> 01:39:23,559
just the the smell sensory of it in a

2519
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:25,279
jar like because you're actually tasting

2520
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,320
that and it's reacting on your tongue

2521
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:29,439
and so um I feel like that's actually

2522
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:31,039
one of the best ways to like experience

2523
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:33,559
what something tastes like I just don't

2524
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:35,319
usually like it once I start smoking

2525
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,400
because those stages to me they like

2526
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:40,319
mostly go downhill like I'm open to be

2527
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:43,000
proven Wrong by like a specific sample

2528
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:45,559
you know I guess though one one benefit

2529
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,560
is that it does give you like some

2530
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:50,760
additional data points I mean it may be

2531
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:52,400
like really trivial in the end but maybe

2532
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,199
baby

2533
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:56,519
yeah there's the wi Dash thing there's

2534
01:39:54,198 --> 01:39:58,519
like okay maybe this type of flower

2535
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:00,679
seems to progress better you know it

2536
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,119
doesn't go downhill as quite as much as

2537
01:40:00,679 --> 01:40:05,359
other ones that kind of thing um I guess

2538
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:06,759
I'm just bringing it back to like you

2539
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:08,198
know this this is also another way of

2540
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:10,440
thinking about all the different ways

2541
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:13,000
you can try to evaluate your flower we

2542
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:14,479
obviously didn't talk about like how how

2543
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,560
well it extracts and all that stuff

2544
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:19,598
obviously that's like another another

2545
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:21,800
kind of like metric you could use yeah

2546
01:40:19,599 --> 01:40:24,960
yeah that goes back to like the

2547
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,920
thing like rosin is just such a pain in

2548
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,719
the ass trait to breed for because it's

2549
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,760
not only growing the plants and

2550
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:33,039
identifying the resin traits there's

2551
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:35,119
also all the post Harvest evaluation

2552
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:36,479
side of it it's not just like oh is this

2553
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:38,039
dank you're like no then I have to go

2554
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:40,718
through a whole separate process of

2555
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:42,960
turning it into the best hash I can you

2556
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,719
know and I'm not a expert hash maker at

2557
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,679
all and so like it sucks when I have to

2558
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:49,439
do it you know what I mean um yeah I'm

2559
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,920
hoping I can pick up some skills from

2560
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:54,118
some of the people on here and just get

2561
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:58,359
get some practice you know but um it is

2562
01:40:54,118 --> 01:41:01,000
like its own whole beast and so um it's

2563
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:02,639
uh it's interesting I I haven't made

2564
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,439
heads or tails of it yet but you know

2565
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:07,800
what I mean like it's not as simple as

2566
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:09,399
taking one 5% washer and Crossing it to

2567
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:11,320
another because you don't even know if

2568
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:15,799
they like wash for the same reason and

2569
01:41:11,319 --> 01:41:17,559
so evaluation can take like so many um

2570
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:20,360
different like you know it can have so

2571
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:22,520
many faces to it um but going back to

2572
01:41:20,359 --> 01:41:24,759
the Joint flavor and stuff like that's

2573
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:26,480
one thing I love about like Jack types

2574
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:29,119
and train wreck and stuff is those

2575
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:33,000
flavors do last through a joint and like

2576
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:35,759
J1 too j1's really nice for that

2577
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,479
um it's really enjoyable when you do get

2578
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:41,480
those those experiences yeah man

2579
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:43,919
terpinolene bro that [ __ ] like lasts

2580
01:41:41,479 --> 01:41:46,039
forever yeah it's

2581
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,039
great especially cuz you can get like

2582
01:41:46,039 --> 01:41:50,319
sweet bubblegum terpinolene like that's

2583
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:51,880
one of my favorite things right now is

2584
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:53,799
that it's like you can have a lot of

2585
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:58,480
different Nuance on terpinolene or like

2586
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:01,760
mango terpinolene you know and so um I

2587
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:03,559
think that's another not well explored

2588
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:07,039
Avenue because people think tealing is

2589
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:09,880
just tealing and it's like no I I've I

2590
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:13,118
disagree at this point now oh totally

2591
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:16,000
dude it's it's like the I don't know it

2592
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:18,960
it's the everything turp right for real

2593
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,960
yeah yeah more than

2594
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:24,599
Mercy oh I love it man [ __ ] it's it's

2595
01:42:22,359 --> 01:42:25,960
divisive like I I've had arguments

2596
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:28,520
friends about it and stuff like that

2597
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:31,279
because I I agree it can be present in

2598
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:33,239
boring situations like I've had a couple

2599
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:34,920
of bags of stuff that was just like you

2600
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:36,319
know not decent smoke at all like if it

2601
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,039
pops up where you don't want it you know

2602
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:41,319
what I mean exactly I a bunch of OG

2603
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:43,760
hybrids and it utilized um one of the

2604
01:42:41,319 --> 01:42:46,000
parents on mons side had like the cat

2605
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,760
piss in it which is I think it's just a

2606
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,520
San Diego cat piss so it's like a super

2607
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,840
silver haze cut of sorts and so like all

2608
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:54,440
three throughout veg I'm getting this

2609
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,000
nice like lime fely sort of Aroma and

2610
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:57,799
then as it all capped off pretty much

2611
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,639
all of them cured out to like a toine

2612
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:03,279
sort of smell in that instance I didn't

2613
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,719
like it but man most time I love it like

2614
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:06,960
some of the favorite smokes I've had

2615
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:08,679
like the Dutch Haze in Amsterdam from

2616
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,439
coffee shops like the better Haze I had

2617
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:12,520
over there was like the teal smell I

2618
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:15,279
didn't see too much of the A5 kind of

2619
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:17,199
stuff but um yeah even over here man

2620
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:18,880
like yeah some of the the more preferred

2621
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:21,919
plants I've found have had to pinoline

2622
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:23,199
in it for sure but but I'm um it's

2623
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,719
interesting with flavor like getting

2624
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,799
back to like vaping and smoking sorry I

2625
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,439
missed that part I [ __ ] I got like a

2626
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,119
nerve thing at the moment I'm all yeah

2627
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:34,719
[ __ ] up

2628
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:36,719
we like some weed man like seems to be

2629
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:39,480
the stuff that's more hashy I prefer

2630
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,560
smoking so like I predominantly Vape but

2631
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:43,000
if you get something that's got like

2632
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,039
that hashy or like the kushes tend to do

2633
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
it like that jager cut even has it a

2634
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:49,198
little bit it seems to like cling to the

2635
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
palette and you know what I mean it's uh

2636
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,479
I don't know compared to other stuff you

2637
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
taste it where it's just like you know a

2638
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:56,678
smoke or a cool smoke flavor or even

2639
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,238
like the more astringent [ __ ] like some

2640
01:43:56,679 --> 01:44:00,158
stuff I've had that super citrusy I

2641
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:01,839
don't like smoking it just at that

2642
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,079
temperature I don't know does something

2643
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:06,199
to the mouth feel but in a vaporizer

2644
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:08,279
it's all fine like because I I really

2645
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:10,079
like vaping like I've had a vape for I

2646
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:11,679
don't know five or six years like have

2647
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:13,719
the crafty from stores and Bickle that

2648
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,319
one's DEC for portable and then I've got

2649
01:44:13,719 --> 01:44:17,719
like one of those ball Vapes now which

2650
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:19,319
are like the tabletop ones with the um

2651
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:22,000
the little hammer and like the rubies

2652
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:23,880
and [ __ ] that heat up it's next level

2653
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,560
like it's similar to that vrp thing that

2654
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,400
that Matt has I guess and for in terms

2655
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:29,960
of like getting TPS and stuff out of it

2656
01:44:27,399 --> 01:44:32,920
and um and effect as well yeah that [ __ ]

2657
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,920
rips does the

2658
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:38,399
job um maybe this is encouraging me to

2659
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:42,319
go back to using my vape a bit more cuz

2660
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:44,198
like I I go in and out of it uh but I

2661
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:45,799
think especially when I've just got some

2662
01:44:44,198 --> 01:44:47,519
like freshly harvested flour it's

2663
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,599
probably a really good time to pull it

2664
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,639
out it's good with cess as well like in

2665
01:44:50,599 --> 01:44:54,159
both ways I think like you said before

2666
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,279
smoking it and vaping it like you know

2667
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:57,399
when you really get down to the

2668
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:59,000
nitty-gritty of like sorting between

2669
01:44:57,399 --> 01:45:01,479
like a couple of fenos you know see how

2670
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,800
it works both ways like we did a little

2671
01:45:01,479 --> 01:45:05,598
um Cana competition no not even [ __ ]

2672
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,440
competition man that's a wank but just a

2673
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:08,840
bunch of us like 10 of us in the other

2674
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:12,000
Discord that you're in we did like a

2675
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:13,719
little you know trade and share sort of

2676
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,599
thing and with each sample of that I'd

2677
01:45:13,719 --> 01:45:18,439
try one you know smoking in the bong or

2678
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:20,560
whatever and one in the Vape but um man

2679
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:22,919
I have to admit it'll be unpopular

2680
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:25,080
opinion but every once in a while I will

2681
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:28,199
put a little bit of tobacco into a joint

2682
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:30,479
as well I

2683
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:32,919
it

2684
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,598
Blas no not in the bong man [ __ ] that

2685
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:37,399
I'm not that animal but like having like

2686
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:40,159
a bit of red wine or something it's been

2687
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:41,479
a nice meal you know it's a cool night I

2688
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:42,960
I'll put a little bit of tobacco in but

2689
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:44,919
it's got to be good weed like if if it

2690
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,960
tastes like [ __ ] and it's going to like

2691
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:49,719
you know just be completely covered by

2692
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:51,760
it um not into it but but yeah I was a

2693
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:53,279
fan of that America Spirit tobacco cuz I

2694
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,480
lived in [ __ ] Europe man for like a

2695
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,118
year and a bit you know everyone over

2696
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:59,399
there smokes that way I smoked American

2697
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:02,559
Spirit when I was traveling there yeah

2698
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:05,479
it was cheap yeah I was gonna say

2699
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:08,840
actually like hash and tobacco man that

2700
01:46:05,479 --> 01:46:11,079
is a really interesting combination

2701
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:13,279
like sometimes you could really taste

2702
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:16,238
like the hash like I mean I don't

2703
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:18,840
make like any sort of like special I

2704
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:21,598
just use a [ __ ] trim trim screen and

2705
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:24,119
use that but like even that mix with

2706
01:46:21,599 --> 01:46:26,400
tobacco dude is super [ __ ] nice

2707
01:46:24,118 --> 01:46:29,960
tasting and I don't I don't smoke

2708
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:31,319
tobacco either so no me neither no I

2709
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:33,039
don't smoke cigarettes or anything but

2710
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:35,479
yeah no hash and tobacco is the next

2711
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:37,079
level like in Amsterdam the pre-rolled

2712
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:38,799
ones that they sell at the coffee shops

2713
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:40,399
for [ __ ] house because it'll be like you

2714
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,560
know like the tiniest little bli hash

2715
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:44,238
and like two cigarettes but yeah rolling

2716
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,039
yourself with some decent has like

2717
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:48,359
decent hash making a snake in the middle

2718
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:49,800
and stuff oh yeah beautiful because it

2719
01:46:48,359 --> 01:46:51,559
completely covers the flavor and it's I

2720
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:53,400
don't know it's and it's unbridled you

2721
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:55,039
know you're not having to mix it with um

2722
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:55,920
you know a different cannabis variety

2723
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:57,840
you know because it's not like you've

2724
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,279
got like the stift off that same [ __ ]

2725
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,239
plant unless you're growing it yourself

2726
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:07,079
at home maybe I'm just a degenerate but

2727
01:47:02,238 --> 01:47:07,079
I love taking bong rips of those 50s the

2728
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:12,759
Moes they're so good wait what do you

2729
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:16,198
what do you mean it's like half weed

2730
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:19,280
half tobacco I don't really do it much

2731
01:47:16,198 --> 01:47:21,000
anymore I've I've heard Moes I've heard

2732
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:23,960
Mo I've heard

2733
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,198
um God I've heard a few other ones too

2734
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:27,679
not so always called them 50s like I

2735
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:29,118
don't [ __ ] know man I've heard a

2736
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:31,079
bunch of different names but it's all

2737
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,639
the same [ __ ] and it's I heard I watched

2738
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:34,079
a documentary and I think it was Oregon

2739
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:35,840
or some [ __ ] and it was like a a

2740
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:38,238
concerned parents

2741
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,239
thing all these kids were like mixing

2742
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:41,759
their balls like 50/50 in the woods and

2743
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:43,718
like passing out and [ __ ] man it was

2744
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:47,239
crazy yeah if you're not ready you're

2745
01:47:43,719 --> 01:47:50,880
going to nod back like it's going to rip

2746
01:47:47,238 --> 01:47:52,959
your head off yeah yeah or throw up more

2747
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,480
like the [ __ ] rule than the exception

2748
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,239
like it's probably going out a bit now

2749
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:58,279
but for the most part

2750
01:47:56,238 --> 01:48:01,399
most I remember doing that with like

2751
01:47:58,279 --> 01:48:04,359
gravity bongs and stuff like doing like

2752
01:48:01,399 --> 01:48:07,079
three ler pulls and stuff man like I

2753
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:09,359
think it was like bod who said like in

2754
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:10,880
um like in his travels like into like

2755
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,960
the Himalayan areas like I don't know if

2756
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,319
that was Nepal or what but like he said

2757
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:18,399
that like they um they say that like you

2758
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:20,599
the weed makes you high but the tobacco

2759
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:21,638
keeps your feet on the ground something

2760
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:24,000
like

2761
01:48:21,639 --> 01:48:26,679
that um I always liked that that little

2762
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,880
saying oh yeah I remember it Mellows

2763
01:48:26,679 --> 01:48:29,960
that it Mellows the the harshness or

2764
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,279
like you know what I mean sometimes

2765
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:35,239
you're just like floating away floating

2766
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:37,840
away High yeah lost like intro you know

2767
01:48:35,238 --> 01:48:39,319
introverted and mute I don't know about

2768
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,719
man like if you're not used to it

2769
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:44,000
[ __ ] hell like I I want to move like

2770
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:46,480
I did an exchange in Europe for like 12

2771
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,800
months at school and then mve back and

2772
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:49,559
then my mates come and visited me and I

2773
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:51,239
hadn't smoked tobacco in like six months

2774
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,360
and I remember that first split that was

2775
01:48:51,238 --> 01:48:55,118
[ __ ] higher than I've been in a long

2776
01:48:53,359 --> 01:48:57,439
time like it hits differently when you

2777
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,439
haven't had it for a while but but why I

2778
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:00,719
like to not do it now it's just if I'm

2779
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:02,118
drinking for the most part you know what

2780
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:04,639
I mean like

2781
01:49:02,118 --> 01:49:06,039
same yeah the inhibitions go down and

2782
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,319
you're like [ __ ] it who's got a

2783
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:11,158
cigarette I've always found it to be

2784
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:12,920
mild psych mildly psychedelic for me

2785
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:15,879
because I don't like since I don't smoke

2786
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:19,599
tobacco at all dude that nicotine [ __ ]

2787
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:21,920
me up oh dude that Rush is yeah it's not

2788
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:25,440
small yeah I like to dip so it's not

2789
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:28,480
that bad for me so oh dude it's ex it's

2790
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:30,638
excellent dude it's I almost compare it

2791
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,879
more to an opiate to for me though and

2792
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:34,599
like my personal experience cuz like it

2793
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,440
feels like a very short-lived like

2794
01:49:34,599 --> 01:49:39,840
opiate lethargy you know just like gone

2795
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:39,839
on the

2796
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:47,599
couch no I get that I understand that

2797
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:49,480
yeah um I will say that like it actually

2798
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,880
does bring me some joy that we got so

2799
01:49:49,479 --> 01:49:55,319
far off track because typically I'm I'm

2800
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,319
really anal about these shows but I've

2801
01:49:55,319 --> 01:49:58,479
actually been waiting for a good

2802
01:49:56,319 --> 01:50:00,599
opportunity to like just let let let

2803
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:04,359
people go off and just we just talk

2804
01:50:00,599 --> 01:50:07,000
about whatever um but I think that like

2805
01:50:04,359 --> 01:50:09,880
we're coming to the end of the two hours

2806
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:13,359
and I don't know um booze you did have a

2807
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:15,800
few other questions about more like um

2808
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:18,359
some of the mechanics maybe or tactics

2809
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:19,599
when you're breeding selecting I don't

2810
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:21,439
know if you want to go into those or if

2811
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:25,199
we should just like rap it here like

2812
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:26,919
call it here um oh it's just more like

2813
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:30,559
the whole thing man said it's fairly

2814
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:32,279
[ __ ] multifaceted and very open to

2815
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,800
discussion as well like selection in

2816
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:34,840
general it's like what I preface the

2817
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,360
whole thing with like you know from

2818
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:38,639
selecting the pack of seeds to the way

2819
01:50:36,359 --> 01:50:40,399
you grow it to the light and everything

2820
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:43,359
you know like it's pretty [ __ ] open

2821
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:45,399
but just like yeah in the I guess tail

2822
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:47,359
end of it all once you've made before

2823
01:50:45,399 --> 01:50:49,399
you go into that sorry boo one last

2824
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:51,078
thing I'll say is that one thing I have

2825
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:53,279
definitely learned now this is like the

2826
01:50:51,078 --> 01:50:54,559
fifth breeding episode I've done it's

2827
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:56,479
really hard to say you're going to talk

2828
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,920
about this like one part of breeding

2829
01:50:56,479 --> 01:51:01,799
without talking about all the other

2830
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:03,319
parts um and I think I'm like starting

2831
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:06,760
to understand that like for some of

2832
01:51:03,319 --> 01:51:09,118
these episodes you know the like outline

2833
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:11,159
is probably only like you know useful to

2834
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:12,439
like a degree after which it's like you

2835
01:51:11,158 --> 01:51:14,759
know like you say there's so many

2836
01:51:12,439 --> 01:51:16,479
dimensions so many parameters and like

2837
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:19,239
variables that like you just end up

2838
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:21,919
having to loop around but yeah sorry

2839
01:51:19,238 --> 01:51:24,039
that was just me like hiding up you're a

2840
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,800
good brother keep the ship steady I like

2841
01:51:24,039 --> 01:51:30,840
it admin

2842
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:32,360
fold oh man dude I don't PA enough um

2843
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,279
yeah did I mean did you want to ask any

2844
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:34,519
of those questions because some of them

2845
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:36,118
are interesting and I would be kind of

2846
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:37,880
curious to know what these guys think so

2847
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:39,279
maybe this is the way to round it out

2848
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,440
yeah for sure man yeah so like once

2849
01:51:39,279 --> 01:51:42,920
you've made your selections you know

2850
01:51:40,439 --> 01:51:44,238
what I mean you've you've gone through a

2851
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:46,158
couple packets of seeds or whatever and

2852
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:47,718
you've come out with a few numbers like

2853
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:48,879
are you going to run those from clone a

2854
01:51:47,719 --> 01:51:50,840
couple of times like what's your

2855
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,000
consideration after that you know what I

2856
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,279
mean like how many times basically do

2857
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,319
you want to see that thing perform are

2858
01:51:54,279 --> 01:51:58,000
you going to try and dial it in like how

2859
01:51:56,319 --> 01:51:59,519
quick are you to throw things away do

2860
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,679
you guys generally keep like multiple

2861
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,440
things from a run and run it again a few

2862
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,719
times just to narrow it down and make

2863
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:06,879
sure you haven't like [ __ ] up

2864
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:09,520
underwatered whatever along the way

2865
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:13,480
what's yeah I I I like the way that this

2866
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,960
guy has has taught me um here one second

2867
01:52:13,479 --> 01:52:17,718
good night

2868
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:21,599
buddy sorry my son's going to

2869
01:52:17,719 --> 01:52:24,560
bed but um reading should almost always

2870
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:26,319
be about like um omissions more than

2871
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,679
selections when you're at like a really

2872
01:52:26,319 --> 01:52:31,158
large scale because like it's about like

2873
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:33,078
honing things down slowly so you don't

2874
01:52:31,158 --> 01:52:34,799
miss so like there's usually a few

2875
01:52:33,078 --> 01:52:36,719
plants that you can throw away because

2876
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,279
you're like oh that is that is some

2877
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,840
garbage it doesn't smell good doesn't

2878
01:52:38,279 --> 01:52:43,319
taste good the effect was kind of me you

2879
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:45,760
know it's weed but um and so I kind of

2880
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:48,078
like that that model of like not so much

2881
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,360
making selections as much as like

2882
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:52,319
figuring out what to get rid of and that

2883
01:52:50,359 --> 01:52:53,598
way it's not such a hard decision

2884
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:55,359
because you're not wondering of what

2885
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:57,560
could be you're actually looking at what

2886
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:59,960
you can see and like what's right in

2887
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,599
front of you instead of like well is it

2888
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:04,639
possible that this could be in there

2889
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:06,560
kind of thing um but like I think you

2890
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,920
also said like how do you like do the

2891
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,960
numbers I like to like narrow it slowly

2892
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:14,560
and so like say I run you know a 10 pack

2893
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:17,158
of seeds I found three that I liked I'll

2894
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,920
probably go and fill my 4x4 tent with a

2895
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:20,319
few clones of each of those you know

2896
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:23,920
what I mean because it's actually kind

2897
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:26,000
of nice to see um if there's any slight

2898
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,880
variation or like I don't know I feel

2899
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,439
like it gives you a b idea of what

2900
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:31,480
you're looking at from an individual

2901
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:34,359
when you've got like four side by side

2902
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:35,919
it just like for me that helps me just

2903
01:53:34,359 --> 01:53:37,559
like delineate and like you were

2904
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:40,359
mentioning earlier of like grouping

2905
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:42,199
plants in categories you know like that

2906
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:44,639
that also is kind of where I'm doing

2907
01:53:42,198 --> 01:53:47,118
this where I'm like okay like I'll try

2908
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:49,960
and pick the best out of each category

2909
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:51,920
so I'm not like comparing you know very

2910
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:53,399
subtle Nuance more that just like I've

2911
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,599
got a few different plants you know what

2912
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:57,719
I mean and I'm like I like this one for

2913
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:59,599
this reason this one for that and then

2914
01:53:57,719 --> 01:54:01,158
like at the end that's the hard part

2915
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,920
where it's like

2916
01:54:01,158 --> 01:54:05,479
oh I'm comparing apples to oranges kind

2917
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,399
of but they're all from the same line

2918
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:09,559
and I can't hold all of them forever I

2919
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:11,399
don't have enough veg space and I'm like

2920
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:13,480
you I hold on to stuff way longer than I

2921
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:15,279
should and so I'm trying to get better

2922
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:18,678
about that but I think by like breeding

2923
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:21,679
by Omission can be like a useful tool in

2924
01:54:18,679 --> 01:54:21,679
that

2925
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:26,479
[ __ ] yeah man what about you local you

2926
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:28,840
got a cold heart you just throw things

2927
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:33,078
away or what do you think he's probably

2928
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:33,078
got like 90 Solo cups in his place

2929
01:54:34,198 --> 01:54:40,359
man

2930
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:43,440
um yeah I don't know man it's it's tough

2931
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:45,039
because right now I'm kind of in that um

2932
01:54:43,439 --> 01:54:49,000
quote unquote

2933
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:50,880
collection yeah stage like I mean like

2934
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,039
Growing Seeds s and find and keeping

2935
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:57,639
stuffff from

2936
01:54:52,039 --> 01:55:00,439
that um but like I don't know like I

2937
01:54:57,639 --> 01:55:04,840
wish I had kept something for example

2938
01:55:00,439 --> 01:55:06,759
from the sure best one but you know um

2939
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:09,078
I'm gonna have to pop another pack

2940
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:11,440
unfortunately because like there are

2941
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:14,679
just like so there's just a lot of [ __ ]

2942
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:16,598
that sometimes I can't clone or not like

2943
01:55:14,679 --> 01:55:20,199
physically can't clone but it's just

2944
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:23,119
like do I realistically need everything

2945
01:55:20,198 --> 01:55:25,359
from this run you know what I mean like

2946
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:26,920
I don't know because some some grows are

2947
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:31,359
just like

2948
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:34,039
uh pop it see what it is and move on you

2949
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:37,439
know yeah just a little data point good

2950
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:41,599
reference point exactly um but I don't

2951
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:43,879
know it it's hard to pick Keepers man it

2952
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:46,000
really is especially when you're you get

2953
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:48,279
a little critical about

2954
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,359
it and this is where like I mean it's

2955
01:55:48,279 --> 01:55:52,599
obvious but they really is a limit to

2956
01:55:50,359 --> 01:55:55,960
the kind of like formal kind of like

2957
01:55:52,599 --> 01:55:57,679
data driven side of this right there's a

2958
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:59,560
part where that just has to end like we

2959
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:02,639
said earlier and you're just then

2960
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:05,079
relying on your like instinct yeah gut

2961
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:07,920
some kind of like act of God like rooll

2962
01:56:05,078 --> 01:56:09,799
of the dice you know random arbitary

2963
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,239
decision yeah there usually is like a

2964
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:13,960
hard deadline in like the scaled stuff

2965
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,439
where it's like no no no decision has to

2966
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:18,359
be made by this time and sometimes it's

2967
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:21,078
really hard and like you say it's a gut

2968
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:23,839
decision it's Instinct it's like what

2969
01:56:21,078 --> 01:56:25,799
you know and so like that's when I start

2970
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,560
leaning on like which one's the most

2971
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:30,840
potent cuz if I've screen them out

2972
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,920
chances are if they make it to those

2973
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,199
final steps that they're all pretty damn

2974
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:37,840
good and so that's when I start really

2975
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,719
honing in on effect where I'm just like

2976
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:42,360
I really love this and do other people

2977
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:43,880
also like the effect and like you know

2978
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:46,559
it's good to be able to Outsource some

2979
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:48,440
of that to uh the masses or just even

2980
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:52,360
the people you're friends with or work

2981
01:56:48,439 --> 01:56:54,638
with whatever um and start crowdsourcing

2982
01:56:52,359 --> 01:56:56,319
those uh those types of notes but I

2983
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:58,199
honestly think it's the breeder's job at

2984
01:56:56,319 --> 01:57:00,559
the end of the day to make that call and

2985
01:56:58,198 --> 01:57:02,359
to to stick by what they know and what

2986
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,639
they think and that that gut instinct

2987
01:57:02,359 --> 01:57:07,198
because um that's kind of like what

2988
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,760
you're developing right it's just like

2989
01:57:07,198 --> 01:57:11,879
you don't always have a reason but

2990
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:15,440
you're just like H I like this plant and

2991
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:15,440
for me that's kind of served me pretty

2992
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:23,239
well I was also gonna say

2993
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:25,599
that I typically find that there's like

2994
01:57:23,238 --> 01:57:28,238
an instant bias between the plant that

2995
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:30,599
you have your eye on like when it's

2996
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:32,638
growing and when it like comes out in

2997
01:57:30,599 --> 01:57:34,480
flower like I often find that that

2998
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:36,000
correlates heavily for some reason I

2999
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:41,519
don't know if that's just me and my

3000
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:44,599
biases but I don't know it's like a

3001
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:47,719
keeper it it's like it's Paramount you

3002
01:57:44,599 --> 01:57:49,599
know as boo said in the

3003
01:57:47,719 --> 01:57:51,560
beginning yeah I always kind of of

3004
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:52,920
gravitate to the the production ones

3005
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:55,159
that are pretty easy to grow because

3006
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:57,679
they look so good they usually smell

3007
01:57:55,158 --> 01:57:59,920
good but I I usually find them a little

3008
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,599
La luster in the Smoke Department

3009
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,000
compared to some of their runty pain in

3010
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:05,880
the ass

3011
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,000
sisters um but I've been growing some

3012
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:10,199
weird [ __ ] until more more recently I'm

3013
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,560
excited to be a little more on the map

3014
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:14,479
and out of my own little projects for a

3015
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,360
while because it's nice to go through

3016
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,598
that exploration phase every few years

3017
01:58:16,359 --> 01:58:20,238
and just find some more cool cuts from

3018
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:22,279
projects your buddy have done and stuff

3019
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:24,759
like

3020
01:58:22,279 --> 01:58:26,399
that thousand are you hanging on to any

3021
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,760
clones like I know you're not growing

3022
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:29,078
like massive numbers or anything but how

3023
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:31,159
do you gravitate like when you're

3024
01:58:29,078 --> 01:58:33,078
popping seeds are you thinking all right

3025
01:58:31,158 --> 01:58:34,559
I'm going to you know hang like am I

3026
01:58:33,078 --> 01:58:36,359
looking for something to keep is that

3027
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,039
your idea or you sort of just having a

3028
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:40,519
look until maybe a later date when it's

3029
01:58:38,039 --> 01:58:42,679
more conducive to to keep and

3030
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:44,719
[ __ ] I'm so I'm like I have been

3031
01:58:42,679 --> 01:58:47,960
provisioning for it and I am rerunning

3032
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:50,319
some Glass Onion stuff right now um as

3033
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:54,078
well as this like born in one of the

3034
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:55,479
born in the purples um that I liked um

3035
01:58:54,078 --> 01:58:59,439
yeah for me it's hard like it's hard to

3036
01:58:55,479 --> 01:59:01,559
know how long I can keep anything um I

3037
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:02,879
have some very very yeah you you all

3038
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:05,440
three know that I have some like very

3039
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:08,599
severe like spatial constraints but I'm

3040
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:10,879
still testing the limits of it uh I can

3041
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:13,639
at the moment like in my Nursery quote

3042
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,319
unquote I've got like maybe like six

3043
01:59:13,639 --> 01:59:18,560
plants in there six

3044
01:59:15,319 --> 01:59:21,880
individuals um so I can keep a small

3045
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:23,920
number um but I don't think I've done

3046
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:28,960
this long enough to kind of really

3047
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:28,960
have seen any pions yet if that makes

3048
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,760
sense yeah at this point I think all I'm

3049
01:59:32,479 --> 01:59:36,319
interested in is just seeing how

3050
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,480
different the Clones do like for now you

3051
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:39,000
know and just kind of getting like a

3052
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:40,439
general appreciation for it like I

3053
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:44,000
remember asking

3054
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:46,678
faran uh just in a voice chat once like

3055
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,960
about how he saw those differences and I

3056
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:49,880
think one of the interesting things he

3057
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:52,639
mentioned to me was

3058
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:54,440
and correct me if I'm wrong Dan like uh

3059
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:56,199
for a lot of clones it takes like six

3060
01:59:54,439 --> 01:59:58,118
months for them to sort of stabilize for

3061
01:59:56,198 --> 02:00:00,078
the horomones to stabilize or whatever

3062
01:59:58,118 --> 02:00:02,439
and at that point you know they tend to

3063
02:00:00,078 --> 02:00:05,639
be more stable but if you've just taken

3064
02:00:02,439 --> 02:00:08,519
them um they may

3065
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:12,039
still behave and grow and express quite

3066
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:13,840
a lot like the seed plot am I correct a

3067
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:15,760
good yeah for sure and I think on some

3068
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:18,880
of the longer flowering stuff I've

3069
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:20,639
noticed it more um but it's kind of like

3070
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:23,400
I don't know if I'm just like reading

3071
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:25,118
into something I've heard the guy say

3072
02:00:23,399 --> 02:00:28,319
that was like an Old Dutch saying or

3073
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:30,559
whatever you know what I mean that um uh

3074
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:33,118
that you know you want to like a plant

3075
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:35,920
that's from the equatorial region has no

3076
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:37,839
like light change pressure no

3077
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:40,118
environmental pressure from cold that's

3078
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:43,000
going to kill it off and so there's like

3079
02:00:40,118 --> 02:00:45,759
this super elongated time clock for the

3080
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,479
plant where before it's like ready to

3081
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,360
flower whereas like something from the

3082
02:00:47,479 --> 02:00:52,678
northern latitudes it has to Flower by a

3083
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:55,359
certain date to Flower by a certain date

3084
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:57,960
to then like die and so I feel like it's

3085
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,799
kind of like in that kind of Realm

3086
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:01,760
that's like how I conceptualize it you

3087
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:04,320
know what I mean is like what was this

3088
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:05,920
like Jean Pool like originally doing to

3089
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:08,039
any extent it's hard to say on like a

3090
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,599
modern one you know but um I've

3091
02:01:08,039 --> 02:01:11,800
definitely noticed it on some longer

3092
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:14,560
flowering stuff even like blue dream

3093
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:16,800
types and um you can kind of see it in

3094
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:19,320
certain seeds like when you grow outside

3095
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,440
is that like I've popped seeds and like

3096
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:23,920
September and they didn't flip for like

3097
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:25,719
a month even though they're seedlings

3098
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,399
outside when there's only like 12 and a

3099
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:30,760
half hours of light you know and so like

3100
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:33,679
they have these built-in clocks in them

3101
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:35,800
to some degree that I don't think yeah

3102
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:37,880
that I don't think that we like fully

3103
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,840
understand and so I like to kind of just

3104
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:41,719
let my siblings chill for a while like

3105
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,719
I've been blown away by how fast some

3106
02:01:41,719 --> 02:01:46,800
people have gotten full-size flowering

3107
02:01:43,719 --> 02:01:48,679
plants from a seed pack on the server

3108
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,719
and I'm just like no I'm still in my 4

3109
02:01:48,679 --> 02:01:54,440
in over here man just letting her go and

3110
02:01:51,719 --> 02:01:57,000
so um maybe it's because I'm not in a

3111
02:01:54,439 --> 02:01:59,238
rush um but

3112
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,760
um I don't know yeah I kind of like to

3113
02:01:59,238 --> 02:02:03,879
let things sit for a

3114
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:05,440
while yeah I think for me like Boo's

3115
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:07,840
sort of already kind of indicated

3116
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:09,799
towards this but I think earlier on I

3117
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:11,920
just was hungry to see more variety

3118
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:13,639
right just for the first few years

3119
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,399
that's all I wanted yeah and I'm sure

3120
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:17,639
you still and that it's not like that

3121
02:02:15,399 --> 02:02:19,078
desire is gone but I think that there is

3122
02:02:17,639 --> 02:02:21,800
it's now being increasingly counted

3123
02:02:19,078 --> 02:02:23,479
appointed with that tension of like well

3124
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:25,360
surely you want to see some like some of

3125
02:02:23,479 --> 02:02:27,078
the same stuff too you know again and

3126
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:30,479
again too so it's like trying to balance

3127
02:02:27,078 --> 02:02:32,479
that is yeah interesting as well yeah

3128
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:33,879
like I always love fuel every time

3129
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:35,959
someone gives me even if it's like a

3130
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:37,920
super purple zah like when it's fuel I

3131
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:41,158
love it you know and I'm like I'll smoke

3132
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:43,199
that yeah give me a jar yeah yeah

3133
02:02:41,158 --> 02:02:45,479
absolutely certain things that never go

3134
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:48,118
out of style and fuel is one of those

3135
02:02:45,479 --> 02:02:50,118
things and I think I'm just getting to

3136
02:02:48,118 --> 02:02:52,319
that point of of starting to understand

3137
02:02:50,118 --> 02:02:55,639
what it is that I like and and maybe not

3138
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:57,319
even quite why yet but yeah yeah so yeah

3139
02:02:55,639 --> 02:02:59,159
now I've been on a journey the same way

3140
02:02:57,319 --> 02:03:01,920
I've just been growing what or growing

3141
02:02:59,158 --> 02:03:03,439
Staples and smoking Staples forever so

3142
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,520
it's a good Baseline but it's like what

3143
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:07,559
do you actually want to smoke and so I

3144
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:10,000
always default to chem and ogs because

3145
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:11,440
like that's what gets me there but like

3146
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,679
I'm sure there's plenty of other stuff

3147
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:15,118
I'm pretty excited about some of the

3148
02:03:12,679 --> 02:03:16,639
high and Lonesome stuff I've gotten and

3149
02:03:15,118 --> 02:03:18,519
um some of the blueberry stuff I've yet

3150
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,400
to run and the blue dream crosses and

3151
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:22,920
stuff so that's right you got some

3152
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:24,759
Bonnet f2s did you not as well yeah yeah

3153
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:27,679
he gave me an extra pack too so now I've

3154
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,880
got like um 30 to go through something

3155
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:30,719
like that I think there are 10 packs

3156
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,880
each I got the box here that he sent me

3157
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:34,920
but um yeah he sent me all kinds of

3158
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:38,279
goodies I was really stoked that I got

3159
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:39,840
some uh some GLE Mountain Dew because um

3160
02:03:38,279 --> 02:03:41,238
I've heard some of the guys on here talk

3161
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,440
about that and I was like man I feel

3162
02:03:41,238 --> 02:03:45,879
like I missed out on that one cuz the

3163
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:47,960
dog [ __ ] is one of those curious cuts to

3164
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:50,199
me that I have not really experienced at

3165
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:51,880
all but for them some of the pictures

3166
02:03:50,198 --> 02:03:54,960
I've seen I'm like oh that's right up my

3167
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:58,118
alley man that electric bugaloo is uh

3168
02:03:54,960 --> 02:04:00,480
it's got my number any final thoughts

3169
02:03:58,118 --> 02:04:02,000
I'm good brother [ __ ] mostly just

3170
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:04,158
yeah you know end of the day [ __ ] with

3171
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,118
any of us said just select what you like

3172
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:08,158
yeah

3173
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:09,920
exactly yeah yeah I think this ended up

3174
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:12,598
being quite a cool conversation like I

3175
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:14,880
think um we ended

3176
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:17,480
up I think you know more or less just

3177
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:19,239
rink towards all the like not all but a

3178
02:04:17,479 --> 02:04:21,399
lot of the kind of critical decision and

3179
02:04:19,238 --> 02:04:23,919
decision points you may

3180
02:04:21,399 --> 02:04:26,679
encounter in selections what some of the

3181
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,279
initial considerations are um and really

3182
02:04:26,679 --> 02:04:31,000
we did just talk about breeding as a

3183
02:04:28,279 --> 02:04:33,319
whole um but I think where I liked us

3184
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:36,118
going that I wasn't prepared I didn't

3185
02:04:33,319 --> 02:04:38,078
expect rather was like I think it was

3186
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:40,679
cool to get each of your Reflections on

3187
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:43,639
like what you thought a good direction

3188
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:45,158
or strategy would be um as well just

3189
02:04:43,639 --> 02:04:46,960
hearing about some of your your more

3190
02:04:45,158 --> 02:04:49,839
personal tastes and yeah especially when

3191
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:51,679
it gets down to that like we said that

3192
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:53,078
impass in selection where you're like

3193
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:55,078
