1
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,760
recumbent

2
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,839
how about them recumbent genetics

3
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,839
uh

4
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,198
she kills me

5
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,979
what's up everyone welcome

6
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:58,078
Wasabi how you doing dude I'm good man

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,719
how are you all right you look tired I

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,460
do don't I your eyes look tired yeah

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,379
they are

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,118
I think this light is not the most

11
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,579
flattering either I might have to change

12
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,579
the dynamic it's all good

13
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,060
let's see what's up

14
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,259
that's a little better maybe not

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,400
hey you're all right

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,740
you just look like you've been punching

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,259
the eye sockets a few times I did get up

18
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,640
pretty early today yeah early for you

19
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,438
yeah for sure

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,000
early for me yeah early for you

21
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,618
all right so tonight

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,700
um I was thinking about maybe we could

23
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,938
talk about

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,060
um a breeding A to Z but in the form of

25
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,199
like maybe I'll give you

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,978
um

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,439
a set of traits and that I want out of

28
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:52,200
an end goal so just teaching people to

29
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,419
start using goals and reading right if

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,780
you trades for an end goal hypothetical

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,759
end goal and you build it with

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,500
in your in your hypothetical toolbox

33
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,319
what what have you and you talked about

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,379
the ways you would go about this project

35
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,780
and then Vice the verse you can give me

36
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,719
some surprise traits and then I'll do

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,419
that with a feminized version of

38
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,020
whatever you give me

39
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,119
um

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,340
you sound like you're underwater today I

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,620
don't know what the deal is is it is it

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,300
coming clear for everyone or just you I

43
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,980
don't know I mean I guess we could ask

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,620
who's [ __ ] on right now can you guys

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:32,039
hear him super clear as he muffled

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,939
how we sounding fasting testing one two

47
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,799
three

48
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,359
I didn't use the cool microphone and

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,980
[ __ ] this round because I thought it was

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,739
just not doing anything different but

51
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,899
maybe that's why okay

52
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,780
okay well maybe it's just me so I'll

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,039
suffer you suffer through it I'll suffer

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,439
through it

55
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,840
okay so yeah so I'm gonna so basically

56
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,060
it's like one of the maybe I'll I'll

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,800
throw like uh my Spiel on it or whatever

58
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,259
but

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,060
um for a minute there uh probably the

60
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:03,060
last five to seven years especially

61
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,900
there was like this explosion of seed

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,900
making

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,760
right and you know we've talked amongst

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,739
about it's probably like maybe even to

65
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,899
the point where like 90 of the current

66
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,959
people selling seeds started in that era

67
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,879
yeah right and so in that time like

68
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,158
there was this big explosion of monetary

69
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,098
value and all that and so

70
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:26,459
the that that economics changed how

71
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:29,158
people bred yeah a lot not everyone but

72
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,979
certainly a lot of people right and like

73
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,299
what used to be like side projects

74
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,000
um you know that were that could take

75
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,920
some time or have goals ended up being

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,818
like mashing a lot of famous things

77
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,979
together

78
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,598
yeah not if there's anything wrong with

79
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,359
that right but it just changed the

80
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,878
dynamic of like you know a lot of

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,220
multi-stage breeding kind of went like

82
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:52,378
to the Wayside yeah I sure did it sure

83
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,658
did right and so what what we're talking

84
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:55,798
about this evening is sort of like you

85
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,479
know I mean I guess you could get lucky

86
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,159
and just knock it out of the Park One

87
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,318
Step but for the most part like it would

88
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,658
be a multi-stage process to get to where

89
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,939
you want yeah I mean over several years

90
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,639
over several several years it's really

91
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,438
hard to knock it out of the park

92
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,000
consistently all the time unless you're

93
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,219
doing certain kinds of Femme breeding of

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,040
known clone to known clone you know but

95
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,259
um yeah yeah you know and so you know

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,519
one of the benefits of like what's

97
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,139
happening right now in the community

98
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,540
might be that like the people that do

99
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,639
decide to keep breeding

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,360
um people are into like longer projects

101
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,680
yeah you know and so it used to be there

102
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
was a minute there where people would be

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,819
like well you can't get Skittles and you

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,879
can't get chem 91 but if I make a hybrid

105
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,399
maybe you'll buy that yeah right and so

106
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,800
rather than like Skittles has these

107
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,019
things that I want and so does chem 91

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,360
and is there a way I can blend these two

109
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,219
things and eventually end up with this

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,000
plant that has the best of both worlds

111
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,580
yeah right I mean that that's still like

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,139
if I can blend these two things I guess

113
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,399
that's still an end goal if you have an

114
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,340
end goal of what you think they might

115
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,959
end up at in the end but that's still

116
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,359
kind of like the process the beginning

117
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,519
process of making crosses it's just like

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,080
hey plant a plant B I want the best of

119
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,579
both let's see what happens you know but

120
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,379
having an end goal where you're like I

121
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,918
want this plant to end up like this for

122
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,478
this environment for this this XYZ is is

123
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,959
super

124
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,060
uh detailed you know yeah well I mean it

125
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,758
depends on how similar you want them to

126
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,220
be like you might only care about like

127
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,139
for instance a couple of the traits yeah

128
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,240
that you're trying to combine and not

129
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,220
need it to be like this obviously like

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,038
the more things you're trying to achieve

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,680
the more the more difficult it becomes

132
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,120
yeah but if you know a simple way to

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,620
think about it would be like what if I

134
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,418
want to combine the Terps from this

135
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,879
plant with the potency of this other one

136
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,579
yeah then you're only searching for two

137
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,259
things yeah right so it can be defined

138
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,319
by your goals too

139
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,639
yeah right in that in that regard I just

140
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,379
think about it so differently I don't

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,478
even think that like to me that I don't

142
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,579
consider that

143
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,199
it's goals but it's not what I'm

144
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,359
necessarily referring to when I say

145
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,419
Goals sure

146
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,300
because one one is I'm predict I want an

147
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:15,180
outcome desired outcome and I'm picking

148
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,220
many I'm picking from my library to make

149
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,079
that outcome happen and the other is

150
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,080
still I'm gonna hit these together and

151
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,579
try to get the best out of what results

152
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,258
based on what I know I'm not saying one

153
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,779
is more legitimate I'm just saying that

154
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,639
like they're you know it's like a little

155
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,978
bit different to try to create like a

156
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,240
line that has certain traits yeah and

157
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,099
what I'm going to ask you to do is going

158
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,280
to be the hard one that's going to be

159
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,199
the hard one the hard one you know and

160
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,239
then and then on top of that too like

161
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,699
you know it it's kind of interesting but

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,439
like if you have breeders

163
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,840
um Matt's one you know like that have

164
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,000
been at it for a long time and that keep

165
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,279
certain plants around quite a long time

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,038
right like our buddy Caleb or flight or

167
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,619
whoever right what they get to do is the

168
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,439
more you breed you actually get to start

169
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,699
to see which traits of the plant that

170
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,219
you breed with

171
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,199
follow up in the kids yeah because

172
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,400
there's some really amazing cuts out

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,000
there

174
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:15,060
um that suck as breeders yes very nice

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,918
so like the the individual cut itself is

176
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,079
amazing it's great smoke and all that

177
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,240
but it's not a stable or a solid thing

178
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,918
yeah and then there's other things that

179
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,780
just seem to breed true for certain

180
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,939
characteristics almost no matter what

181
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,318
yeah there's a lot that are just [ __ ]

182
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,319
Growers that people normally wouldn't

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,660
keep but are are amazing breeders and

184
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,580
don't breed for the traits they visually

185
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,680
Express somebody just said yes

186
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:41,339
terpenolene is very hard to breed out

187
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,079
yeah uh once once it's in there uh boy

188
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,179
it's really difficult finding what you

189
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,418
want without it in there it really

190
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,439
dominates yeah it does if she throws her

191
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:51,598
weight around

192
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,459
you know and that's interesting too

193
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,519
because there's aspects where it's like

194
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,079
uh since I'm gonna do the hard one

195
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,939
um you know what used to be [ __ ] up

196
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,339
about breeding especially if it took

197
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,199
multi-stage is that you have to make

198
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,679
sure that you save seeds from every

199
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,020
stage yeah because you can totally [ __ ]

200
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,699
up a line and do something that you

201
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,500
didn't want to do and it's a real bummer

202
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,240
and if you don't have a way to go back

203
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,160
one generation and go in a different

204
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,699
direction then you're just stuck with

205
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,620
that mistake yeah definitely and and I

206
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,598
don't think most people when they think

207
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,399
about breeding realize that they would

208
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,538
ever have to go back a generation I

209
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,579
don't think that even comes into the

210
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,680
equation in there and there might I know

211
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,860
it didn't when I was young oh yeah I

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
mean it can be just fix it

213
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,399
most of our friends wish they had

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,200
there's at least one project they did

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,820
that they really like that they feel

216
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,560
like they [ __ ] up a bit along the way

217
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,060
and they wish they could go back and

218
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:51,119
redo you know yeah so uh he feels like

219
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,299
DJ did that DJ's stuff is DJ stuff is

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,159
his own story in itself it's Unique

221
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,958
um but you know I mean there's an aspect

222
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,338
of like different people have worked his

223
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,679
stuff in different directions at

224
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,080
different times he's given it over to

225
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,579
seed companies and then gotten back seed

226
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,740
stock

227
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,600
um so it definitely is like what era you

228
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,560
got it from it could vary quite a bit

229
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,000
yeah I would say so yeah you know so you

230
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,639
know but yeah I mean there's there's an

231
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,278
aspect of like I think for like most

232
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,639
hobby breeders really having some kind

233
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,320
of goal is is probably good you know

234
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,819
because I tell people all the time like

235
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,800
the most important thing of what you're

236
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,700
doing is that like you're happy with it

237
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,559
yeah right in the end that's that's it

238
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,360
well yeah I mean we for a long for a

239
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,939
long time we bred we just tried to breed

240
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,680
weed that we like to smoke yeah um

241
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,420
because it was it was long enough ago

242
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,338
that like we just never really felt like

243
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,979
any kind of seed company was was even

244
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,920
realistic yeah I never thought ever

245
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,220
about getting a famous Seed Company ever

246
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,079
in the history of my company yeah I mean

247
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,660
when we were when we were breeding in

248
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,940
the in the 90s and early 2000s and stuff

249
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,799
like that like the people that started

250
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,320
seed companies back then literally still

251
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,059
went to Europe oh yeah yeah you had to

252
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,760
go there to to make it big pretty much

253
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,919
so it was like a massive life [ __ ] like

254
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,278
it was you know so a lot of us we just

255
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,500
bred we just bred for ourselves yeah you

256
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,759
know now it's cool with Instagram you

257
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,620
know and all these different various

258
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,539
platforms you can do some a lot of

259
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,120
people can do small breeding and then

260
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,919
offer it up and Reach people yeah and so

261
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,100
there's this commercialism aspect that

262
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,659
was like hard before so like before a

263
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,259
lot of times people were trying to just

264
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:36,059
please themselves and their buddies

265
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:38,700
and now it's more like please the public

266
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,139
which is fine and there there was a

267
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,360
certain era too where it wasn't even

268
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,578
just please the public it was a much

269
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,800
smaller crowd and it was pleased The

270
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:50,039
Forum crowd you know what I mean oh yeah

271
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,559
sure tiny era of well it may not be what

272
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,019
I like but it's what sells on the forums

273
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,599
and even that is is a vast difference

274
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,879
from what sells on Instagram now you

275
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,800
know so I think I remember those I

276
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,379
remember those eras and what was hot and

277
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,240
like the pressure to breed with all that

278
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,220
work because it's just people want it

279
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,379
and I mean I you know we there's even

280
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,139
posts from Neville when he was when he

281
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,600
was posting in like 2009 or 10. that

282
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:18,299
even in the 80s and early 90s he would

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,639
get [ __ ] for everybody would be like oh

284
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:22,500
I want the purest Indica imaginable yeah

285
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,000
he'd release something that was like

286
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,620
that and then they would suffer and

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,778
yield and he would get endless bitching

288
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,419
yeah so there's always been a commercial

289
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:31,980
aspect of it you know and then you end

290
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,458
up having to like you end up having to

291
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,680
please people so so in some ways all my

292
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,018
friends anybody that breeds for

293
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,819
non-commercial purposes you just get to

294
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,078
do whatever the [ __ ] you want

295
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,720
well

296
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,559
in this case you're going to do what the

297
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,519
customer wants oh my God okay here we go

298
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:55,559
so this is a rather picky customer right

299
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,620
um it's something that obviously has to

300
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,239
work in the modern Market since this is

301
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,919
2022. they want something with eight

302
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,419
weeks flowering they don't want none of

303
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,419
that long flowering [ __ ] that you love

304
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,740
they want eight weeks flowering

305
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,259
um they want a little bit of purple

306
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,120
right a little bit of purple the most

307
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,419
important thing that they're missing in

308
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,578
their Arsenal is black licorice mixed

309
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,919
with gas they want they want some gassy

310
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:23,578
back end on it and black licorice and

311
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:26,219
like I said uh modern market and

312
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,359
they don't want any OG or cookies they

313
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,100
want unique

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,019
oh man

315
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,240
so where do we start

316
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,399
to please this customer we don't want

317
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,159
any OG or cookies so so right there

318
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,839
right that makes it every everybody just

319
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,019
heard like they want like six different

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,079
things yes in the same line so that

321
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,360
everything you add make potentially

322
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,278
makes it harder or longer of a search to

323
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,800
try to figure it out yeah or you have to

324
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,659
get luckier to find it quick or you have

325
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,819
to have a large library that you're very

326
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:58,559
familiar with you know that helps too

327
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,720
because obviously like if you know how

328
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,278
your plants breed that could narrow it

329
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,778
down a bunch that would be helpful like

330
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,078
for me but if you were just trying to

331
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:09,240
smash plants together to find that

332
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,578
aspect it would probably be pretty rough

333
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,500
yeah and so basically what they want is

334
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,359
something that's pretty funny they want

335
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,480
quick purple

336
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,839
they want good Terps

337
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,000
Frosty Frosty is [ __ ] because

338
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,100
[ __ ] oh my God it's a modern Market they

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,059
need something that washes they need

340
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,060
something that washes

341
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,220
um no OG either not just cookies no OG

342
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:37,799
no oh gee that's right you're in that

343
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,720
corner like Berner is doing and they

344
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,759
want it to be feminized or regular no

345
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,680
right you're doing regular oh my God

346
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,600
you're gonna do the same for me in

347
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,500
Reverse with feminizing you can pick the

348
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,200
traits that is horrible yeah

349
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,919
he just said here you go he just [ __ ]

350
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,680
me

351
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,199
um so the hard part obviously is that

352
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,458
okay so just break it down right you

353
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,278
need something you need something Frosty

354
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:07,319
terpy fairly attractive

355
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,778
um uh you needed to come in relatively

356
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,320
quickly and

357
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:15,539
um uh the the hardest one out of all

358
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,000
that is probably like the black licorice

359
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,039
Terps uh because that's pretty specific

360
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,659
and [ __ ] rare

361
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,000
um and then the other part of it that

362
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:26,838
sucks you know is that it has to be a

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,839
regular seed line

364
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,180
so in that in that regard what you would

365
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:36,120
have to do is you would either it can be

366
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,199
several it can be a multi-step process

367
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,759
well yeah I mean so that's what I'm

368
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,440
saying is like you would end up you know

369
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,480
one of your first steps probably would

370
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,720
be like you would have to figure out

371
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,699
what what kind of mail you wanted to use

372
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,639
and then you would cross it to you know

373
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:52,679
the uh one of the females that you want

374
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,659
to use and start there and then you have

375
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,059
a male female blend then because now at

376
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,620
first you need a pollen Source yes right

377
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,179
that was one of the attractiveness of

378
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,860
[ __ ] uh everybody like doing

379
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:03,778
feminized is because they could create

380
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,278
their own pollen source and they knew

381
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,720
pretty much what traits were going to

382
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,338
probably pass because they could smell

383
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,500
their pollen source and look at the bud

384
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,060
yeah yeah so there's so there's

385
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,919
basically there's a way too where it's

386
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,379
like you know once you once you and

387
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,819
that's where all like the BX or BC is

388
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,980
people talking about like that's where

389
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,440
it started yeah is people needed a

390
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,139
pollen donor to start working on their

391
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,940
line idea yeah and then they could start

392
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,440
playing with it once they had pollen

393
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,240
they could make pollen every generation

394
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,639
yeah is really what it boils down to so

395
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,060
um realistically speaking uh probably

396
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,980
really what I would end up doing

397
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:43,979
is that uh

398
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,019
uh my buddy is throwing me off by

399
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,259
answering but what I would probably do

400
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,240
is I would cheat and I would uh my buddy

401
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,819
that just made me laugh uh him and I

402
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,278
made some a bunch of hybrids

403
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,399
um with some old Maple Leaf Indica seeds

404
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,198
from the early 2000s right and one of

405
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,320
the things that we did is we crossed it

406
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,799
to the Mendo P okay right so the Mendo P

407
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,120
has some color it's got crazy Terps uh

408
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,639
it doesn't wash that well or anything

409
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,440
like that but at the very least

410
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,820
um it's something old and basic that you

411
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,959
could start with yes yeah right so you

412
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,778
know one of the things you need to start

413
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,859
with is like an idea of how you're going

414
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:25,259
to start and how you're going to finish

415
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,980
yes right because whatever you finish

416
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:30,720
with the cross is 50 back yes you know

417
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,699
and so you're starting you're starting

418
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,240
and you're ending is 50 50 and in the

419
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:38,219
middle you get to play right so

420
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,480
um and it's not potent yeah no I mean

421
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,160
that's the thing is you're starting with

422
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,440
limitations

423
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,759
we don't need it I don't believe potency

424
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,259
was a part of it because in today's

425
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,000
market you can watch it and everything's

426
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,860
potent so potent's not a part of the

427
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,440
equation

428
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,240
so probably what I would do is I would

429
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,300
take that Maple Leaf Indigo by Mendo

430
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,639
perps right and I would grow it out and

431
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,338
I would pick a male probably one that

432
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,959
leaned like in leaf structure and all

433
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,660
that and especially one that turned

434
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,119
colors uh on its male flowers and stuff

435
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,558
and I would probably pick the most Mendo

436
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,578
perp leaning

437
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,439
uh male I possibly could yeah which it

438
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:19,259
should be relatively easy because the

439
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,540
maple doesn't turn colors and the leaf

440
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,459
structure is way different right and and

441
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,139
Mendo P kicks certain kinds of Terps

442
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,199
doesn't it and Mendo P kicks certain

443
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,360
kinds of Terps right so and well the

444
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,640
other two is that it's like a basic

445
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,558
Indica that I started with and then you

446
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,020
cross it to something extremely unique

447
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,460
so hopefully you can pick out a bunch of

448
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,980
that unique

449
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,079
right in your mail which makes it a lot

450
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,640
easier than if it was like two similar

451
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,038
things yeah

452
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,220
um so take some pollen to that and I

453
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,558
would probably throw it on something

454
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,140
like the snow

455
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,160
all right interesting I wouldn't have

456
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,960
thought of that choice that's an

457
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,700
experience yeah well the reason is is

458
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,140
that when I was doing that project down

459
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,660
south you know I got to run a lot of

460
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,480
Caleb's gear yeah um and I probably ran

461
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,440
half a dozen snow hybrids yeah and the

462
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,319
[ __ ] just consistently kicks nice pretty

463
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,140
colas covered in Frost it shortens up

464
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,700
the the flower time and all that right

465
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,440
so yeah

466
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,259
um you know the Mendo perps would bring

467
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,960
some color and some Terps the snow would

468
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:27,660
bring structure and and Crystal and like

469
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,759
a nice look yeah that's a good that's a

470
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,500
good choice I like it and I've seen it

471
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,079
and I've seen it work consistently on a

472
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,519
bunch of hybrids already yeah throw the

473
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,740
kind of traits through a bunch of

474
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,359
different crosses that I like so the

475
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,460
chance that it could do that and this

476
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:46,159
one is probably reasonably High

477
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:51,660
I think so so boom now I have a snow by

478
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,279
by Maple by purple yeah right so

479
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,840
you grow up that now it's more

480
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,339
complicated because you're looking for

481
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,259
traits

482
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,178
um so now probably what you're doing is

483
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,759
because you're it's not going to be as

484
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,320
easy to visually pick it out it would

485
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,960
probably get shitty and you'd probably

486
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,899
end up picking like three of the nicest

487
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,279
males you could find yeah and separately

488
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,538
pollinating

489
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,220
like the female of your choice yeah then

490
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,200
you grow them all out and you see which

491
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,579
which of those three hopefully passed

492
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,419
the most traits that you were looking

493
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:23,099
for

494
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,419
because there's an aspect with males

495
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,558
where you're like really not going to

496
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:33,240
know yeah you know so the wider mail

497
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,798
pool you use the uh the vet yeah but as

498
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,839
long as you can isolate it and see which

499
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,660
one goes to which yeah for the sake of

500
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,279
this argument not to get like crazy

501
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,220
esoteric and stupid I would just say

502
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:48,899
three triplets yeah you know and so now

503
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:50,519
I have a a snow Mendo P Maple okay right

504
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,980
and

505
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,240
um so I take a male of that or three

506
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,700
males of that

507
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,220
right

508
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,319
and I hit it to I hit it each separately

509
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,259
to my Maui

510
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,319
because the Maui is bringing the Maui

511
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,119
well the Maui turns purple in the cold

512
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:11,759
it's super Frosty it's got chunks all

513
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,459
over it it's done in eight weeks so now

514
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:18,119
you've got a quick Maple a quick Mendo p

515
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,400
a quick Maui you know the snow is

516
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,259
reasonably quick so all of a sudden you

517
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
start upping your chances that like a

518
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,319
Fino that you want is going to be in

519
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,900
that

520
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,200
that 50 to 60 day range of what you're

521
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,000
going for I guess right yeah you know

522
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,620
um and since the Maui turns a little

523
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,940
purple and the Mendo peas purple you

524
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,159
don't have a lot of purple in there but

525
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,558
you have some definitely and you can

526
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,200
start looking for it and the the snow

527
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:46,139
and the Maui end up having like you know

528
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,240
the structure and the frost yeah so then

529
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,020
I would hunt through that

530
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,120
but that's let's see so Maple onto the

531
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,660
maple onto the under the Mendo P that's

532
00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:01,439
one stage yeah right and then that onto

533
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,279
the snow that's two stages and then a a

534
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:09,058
a male out of that onto the Maui

535
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:11,819
you're already at three stages yeah

536
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,220
you know and where's your gas coming in

537
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:17,418
where's my gas coming in

538
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,579
boy you know the gas is going to be hard

539
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:23,460
I think because I think right there you

540
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:27,240
probably have your your

541
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:31,200
um wait you said gas and

542
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,538
yes gas and licorice gas and licorice

543
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,860
[ __ ] dude that's [ __ ] hard you're

544
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:36,839
gonna have to do this what if I just

545
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,158
pick one I'm just gonna pick one and

546
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,879
you're gonna have to deal with it yeah

547
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,880
yeah we could do one

548
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,339
now we have a like what is it like it's

549
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:49,319
like a four-way hybrid now it's like

550
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:50,339
Maple Maple started the pollen Maple

551
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,058
Mendo

552
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:56,038
and snow and Maui yeah

553
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:57,960
so if we wanted if we wanted now it's

554
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:59,460
gonna be 50 of the Cross right so we

555
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,400
have a bunch of early [ __ ] A bunch of

556
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,220
Frosty [ __ ] a couple purple things if I

557
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,259
really wanted to jack up the purple and

558
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,700
the licorice I only have one thing I

559
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,779
could do I could put it on the anise yes

560
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,100
but then that would be but then that

561
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,899
would be that would be [ __ ] because

562
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,480
then there were the the chance that you

563
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:22,460
would also get gas would be kind of hard

564
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,079
the anus the anus

565
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,940
you know uh because black licorice is

566
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,619
really hard so I don't think to be

567
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,120
perfectly honest anymore we're not going

568
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,939
for gas anymore we're just dropping that

569
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,158
going for all black licorice and modern

570
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,200
people are talking about Jaeger the the

571
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,940
Anise is actually extremely close to the

572
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,100
Jaeger the fish oh somebody who said the

573
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,240
fisherman who the [ __ ] just said the

574
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,279
fisherman

575
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,759
that's one what's that one what's that

576
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,079
one so my buddy uh my buddy and I we

577
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,298
used to grow a bunch of Anna's together

578
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,579
and he used to take it down to the bay

579
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:55,500
and give it to certain Crews right and

580
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,439
he was a professional tuner fisherman

581
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,700
yeah so they used to call they used to

582
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,640
call when we sold them that way they

583
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,679
used to call it the the fisherman

584
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,299
nice because my buddy's nickname was

585
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,480
actually tuna

586
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:12,418
tuna oh yeah is he in the movie Blow no

587
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,279
he was not in the movie below damn but

588
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,140
he but yeah I mean he's he's actually

589
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,298
like uh

590
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,340
um you know he's actually a big part of

591
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:23,819
that story really

592
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:25,379
um but yeah the uh the fisherman he uh

593
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,298
um that was probably back in 06 or

594
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,940
something like that so just so people

595
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:32,099
know right like I didn't even talk about

596
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,779
like you could get really lucky in what

597
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:36,480
I described and you could do it all in

598
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,279
in that many steps or you could grow

599
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,960
[ __ ] out and realize it's not at all

600
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,779
what you want and want to go back a step

601
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,640
yeah that's like a best case scenario

602
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,019
right there yeah that that definitely is

603
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,000
the best case scenario you know because

604
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,859
that that's assuming that like each

605
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,380
stage and then you could talk for a

606
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,519
little bit about like well how many

607
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,220
yeah

608
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,960
you know because every cross you have a

609
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,079
female is the certainty

610
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,298
yeah but does the male pass what you

611
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:05,279
want of the hybrid that's why I always

612
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:06,480
call it the shotgun method and yeah you

613
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,859
called it the shotgun method and it's

614
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,960
right but like what they people used to

615
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:12,298
do in the old days is they would

616
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,860
they would cross like their three every

617
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:17,819
stage they would cross their three

618
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:19,979
favorite males yeah to the same female

619
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:21,418
and mark them different and then when

620
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,798
you grow them out

621
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,960
you look

622
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,220
yeah and whatever one gave you the best

623
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,100
females

624
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,798
you picked males from that

625
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,839
that donation

626
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:35,579
you know what I'm saying yeah you know

627
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,259
because you were because that that was

628
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,939
the way that we tested back then if you

629
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,099
just did one nail you're just hoping

630
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,779
three isn't even all that great but it's

631
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,579
like let's be reasonable about people's

632
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:46,079
ability to actually do [ __ ] you know

633
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:48,658
yeah yeah

634
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,158
so you know and then you know it doesn't

635
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,659
I mean it doesn't have to be huge it

636
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,640
just depends on everybody's size it

637
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,340
depends on what you're trying to do you

638
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,840
know 50 or 100 seeds held back is

639
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,839
probably plenty for most people's

640
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,579
purposes yeah yeah you know stick with

641
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,779
and then you'd probably and then you put

642
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:05,759
right there you'd probably have a

643
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,500
situation that would be there would be

644
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,179
plenty of purple plants there would be a

645
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,519
lot of Frosty and Visually attractive

646
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,340
plants the licorice would be in there

647
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,200
but it might be a little harder to find

648
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:18,899
you know and the gas we'd have to do one

649
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,600
more stage to something yeah and to get

650
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,580
lucky and you know they asked what

651
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,558
you're naming it I think um he's gonna

652
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,740
probably call it the obvious the purple

653
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,538
anus

654
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,940
yeah

655
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:35,339
but that's how I mean in a sense like

656
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,100
you know when when we were planning the

657
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,439
super dog project it was like we we were

658
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:42,859
trying to get the the the looks and the

659
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,538
greenery oh and the smell of the skunk

660
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:49,019
combined with like the density and the

661
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:51,298
and the hour of the chem dog yeah you

662
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,220
know and so what Matt just gave me was

663
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,679
he just gave me like what was it a five

664
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,659
or six requirements it was it was

665
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,419
several yeah yeah that makes it a real

666
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:03,059
paint purple black licorice gas

667
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,919
eight weeks flowering works in the

668
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:09,480
modern market so that's that's like five

669
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,919
five that's five yeah yeah it's half a

670
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,558
dozen it's half a dozen different things

671
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,059
so that makes it more difficult yes if

672
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,418
you're only looking to combine a couple

673
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:19,678
of traits from from one cross then you

674
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,240
can do what I'm gonna do with Matt and

675
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,000
he can do easy and you can cheat and you

676
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,620
not don't even need a male yeah you know

677
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,019
but that's how everybody used to start

678
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:29,879
things and then the traditional way

679
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:33,119
which is like what got done to maybe

680
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,640
like the c99 and other [ __ ] was that

681
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,519
people would now it's BC but back then

682
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,278
it was BX people would just repeatedly

683
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,240
cross males of a hybrid to the same

684
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,380
clone

685
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,900
yeah one two three four times basically

686
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,640
trying to get an inbred plant that was

687
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,640
as close to the mother clone as they

688
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,480
could yeah and because of that

689
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,520
that explanation of c99 and there and

690
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,679
and that long explanation of how it was

691
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,019
achieved and blah blah blah people have

692
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,538
consistently even myself I I was trying

693
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,460
to do bx3s for years and finding that

694
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:10,140
like I'm ending up with way more

695
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,720
[ __ ] than I started with why does

696
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,880
this look like an F2 as opposed to an uh

697
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,140
a bx3 this should be locking in stuff

698
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,720
not going way further away from it and

699
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:24,120
it it just doesn't it sometimes things

700
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,038
work great in theory in other plants

701
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,038
that don't necessarily apply as well in

702
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,179
cannabis because it's so variant and a

703
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,240
lot of people don't understand that

704
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,940
because of c99 the the misinfo given

705
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,500
with c99 yeah and I mean people just

706
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,298
think that like you know when you're

707
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,278
bxing it's like you'd probably need a

708
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:43,500
pretty big population and then there's a

709
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,319
reason why they call it inbreeding

710
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,538
depression yeah you know it really takes

711
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,700
big populations to avoid that and so

712
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,859
most people are doing hobby ship you

713
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,360
know and so what you just you know is is

714
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:55,979
like there's an aspect active like

715
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,139
trying to

716
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,900
um you know it's like I always think of

717
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,840
like what Neville's criteria was for his

718
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,640
nl5 hazes yeah right is he didn't want

719
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,220
anything that went over 16 weeks because

720
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,259
he thought that was way too [ __ ] long

721
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,259
and he wanted the potency

722
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,058
and he wanted nice enough Buds and

723
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,619
enough yield that it was worth going the

724
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:19,019
four months it took

725
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,639
and it had to grow and grow down a grow

726
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:22,139
Dan Rockwell on the ground well yeah I

727
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,120
mean they I mean that's all they used or

728
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,980
whatever so that was that was the aspect

729
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,678
but that's not he didn't really actually

730
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,538
breed for Terps he didn't breed no he

731
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,179
didn't add in a bunch of extra [ __ ] he

732
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:35,460
was going for weight potency and it

733
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,620
couldn't take 22 weeks you know like a

734
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,500
lot of the hazes were so you know he

735
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,418
only picked really three things yeah

736
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,159
you know

737
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,620
um and you know we just picked five or

738
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,460
six so it just goes to show that like

739
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,558
don't

740
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,200
don't get discouraged you know try to

741
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,658
try to pick a reasonable a reasonable

742
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,700
blend and it's always easier if like if

743
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,559
Matt hadn't given me like the the

744
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,720
licorice thing was a super [ __ ] but

745
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,819
like if because it really limits there's

746
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,798
only a few things that have it I was

747
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,298
gonna go cinnamon but I decided to be

748
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,099
nice cinnamon I would have just thrown

749
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:10,859
my hands up and been like what the [ __ ]

750
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,359
you know [ __ ] yeah I mean because you

751
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,278
can get too specific but I mean

752
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,859
obviously there's there's scents like

753
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:19,380
gas or like terpenolene or like citrus

754
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:22,019
or whatever that occur commonly enough

755
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,960
in cannabis yeah that you'd have a bunch

756
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:27,480
of paths to pick where you wanted to get

757
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,298
that terp from yeah the terp that Matt

758
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,640
picked was hella limiting so you really

759
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,619
are like grasping at straws there's

760
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,000
there's some good ones I thought of that

761
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,038
you could have come up with that would

762
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,019
have covered all the bases too it was I

763
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,759
might have missed it you know it's hard

764
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:44,278
to think off the top of your head oh my

765
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,158
God a four or five stage project that

766
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,380
requires a real male because you know 20

767
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,580
years ago all your buddy seeds it was

768
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,278
like everything you had in your

769
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:55,319
collection had regular mails in it yeah

770
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,519
and now most of my not all of it but

771
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,339
there's a good chunk of my [ __ ] that's

772
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:01,319
feminized yes so that's all I don't want

773
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,119
to say it's useless but it's like it for

774
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,460
this particular [ __ ] thing it's like

775
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,979
not very helpful yeah how many people

776
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,038
make red seeds right now yeah but you

777
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,860
could have done a femme female with a

778
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,379
male fem line female side

779
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,240
yeah I mean there's probably and that's

780
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,039
the cool part right is that it's like

781
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,319
sometimes past your goal it's like what

782
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:24,480
you have access to yeah like the chem

783
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,639
dla Kush was one I was thinking of

784
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,759
specifically for like maybe some some

785
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,278
turfs like uh uh gas and black licorice

786
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,960
but it's not necessarily purple you know

787
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,880
I actually missed that I didn't realize

788
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,340
that until a whole bunch of people

789
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,919
started popping that hybrid the La by D

790
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,319
yeah and and there's a bunch of people

791
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,419
that got gas and headband Aromas and all

792
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,158
that like I was expecting but I would

793
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,919
say there's been a few dozen people at

794
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,039
least that have talked about Anna's

795
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,380
Terps yeah they got the anus they got

796
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:59,038
the anus which was really interesting

797
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,360
you know to to have that pop up

798
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,200
um you know even occasionally or

799
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,740
whatever

800
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,720
you know uh and you know I I you know I

801
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,519
went on a mission a while a little while

802
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,159
ago and I brought back all those seeds

803
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,099
right yeah and my buddy just never never

804
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,778
did the Femme so remember I was reading

805
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:17,759
him dude the other day yes and it's like

806
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:20,278
a hog because it's like what males did

807
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,679
he have when and what was he using to

808
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,538
blend with what you know

809
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,360
but that's something I've noticed with

810
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,579
like um a lot of Mendo breeding and a

811
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,158
lot of like the old school breeding

812
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:34,079
as opposed to like like with my mindset

813
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,960
it's like I want to use something very

814
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,000
very very basic like almost as close to

815
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,700
land race as I can or something very as

816
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,859
stable as possible um phenotypically

817
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,240
uh on the mail-in so I'm not seeing a

818
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,038
lot of variations so I know where I'm

819
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,720
going whereas back in the day it looks

820
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,940
like they would do that single stage

821
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,679
cross the polyhybrid to polyhybrid to

822
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,840
polyhybrid to polyhybrid to polyhybrid

823
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,980
even back then like it was just how it

824
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,079
was done

825
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,599
it was yeah I mean there was a lot of

826
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,398
like what I call hillweed

827
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,558
um where people would when they sex

828
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,959
their plants their males would stay in

829
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,359
five or ten gallon pots off downwind in

830
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,740
the woods somewhere yeah right and then

831
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,778
when they wanted to make fresh seed

832
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,640
every couple of years or whatever they

833
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:16,859
would wait and they would go collect

834
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,240
pollen from all their saved males and

835
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:20,459
blend it together

836
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,079
right and then they'd walk up to their

837
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,840
patch and their two or three favorite

838
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,158
females that year they would take a

839
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,099
paintbrush or whatever and they would

840
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,419
brush the bottoms yeah of those plants

841
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:32,219
and mark them

842
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,500
so then they're taking a blend of like

843
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,380
you know whatever it is 6 or 12 or 15

844
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,000
boys yeah blending it together and then

845
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,039
adding it to like the three or four

846
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,679
sweetest females they saw from the line

847
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,140
yeah and you do that for 10 or 15 years

848
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,600
and then you have you have a bunch of

849
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,820
kind of unique Hill show yeah you know

850
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,859
it was like it was relatively diverse

851
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,480
and they wouldn't do it every year most

852
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:56,759
people would just try to make fresh seed

853
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,380
stock every two or three sometimes some

854
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,778
people were nerding out and doing it all

855
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,760
the time and some people like seeds was

856
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:04,380
like the only thing they knew about so

857
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,879
they just tried to freshen them up every

858
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,860
other season or so

859
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,360
you know it sounds like I'm talking down

860
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:11,278
on it but I actually like that's the

861
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,259
kind of stuff I hunt like if I hear

862
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,839
about someone having old Hill weed seeds

863
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,700
on something I'm like oh let me get out

864
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,379
of you know like I don't know why but

865
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,659
it's always the most appealing to me for

866
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,100
some reason it's also from an era where

867
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,799
there was a whole bunch of diversity

868
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:27,898
yeah and it was before like the same 45

869
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,778
clones get Blended together in

870
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:33,239
innumerable ways yeah so even just going

871
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:34,558
back that far opens up the gene pool in

872
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,000
a way

873
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,220
um I mean that's kind of why when I said

874
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,200
like you know what my buddy that I made

875
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,480
those seeds with or whatever

876
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,038
um he breeds seeds every year yeah you

877
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,500
know he's got stuff going back he's got

878
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:48,599
all kinds of odd stuff yeah nobody I'm

879
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,919
sure people would love to hear it but he

880
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,538
but you know he breeds for him or

881
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,940
whatever and so he had these you know

882
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:55,798
roughly 20 year old like you know

883
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,860
probably from like right around when

884
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,298
Scentsy was starting to go south yeah

885
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,278
um he has these maple seeds and they

886
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,798
were you know we crossed them to we

887
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:09,300
actually we actually uh grew a bunch of

888
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:11,280
them out um in uh five six years ago the

889
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,619
Mendo perps Maple uh there's some really

890
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,519
pretty pictures of them but they burned

891
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:20,220
damn they burned you know so they got

892
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,338
all the way to like October 9th and then

893
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:25,019
and then they went to [ __ ] you know yeah

894
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:27,179
um but that's kind of how you have to do

895
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,759
it it's like you have to like figure out

896
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,500
where you're gonna get it from and for

897
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,940
me it was a little easier because most

898
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,579
of the plants I've mentioned I've had

899
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,320
for a long time yeah so I know how they

900
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,179
work for someone that's just getting

901
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,399
started or whatever like that kind of

902
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,079
complicated thing not knowing how the

903
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:45,299
plants they have in their stable might

904
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,918
even breed yeah it could be there could

905
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,339
be more missteps

906
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,858
right uh I [ __ ] up a lot yeah you know

907
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,299
so don't don't uh there and there's and

908
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:56,159
I don't mean [ __ ] up I just mean like

909
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,140
you breed things you hope that these two

910
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,660
things come out of them and they don't

911
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,159
yeah so it's like you just have to try

912
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:03,598
it a different way you have to try a

913
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,920
different pairing you have to see if

914
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,140
they blend

915
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,480
you know and the more stages you have to

916
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,940
do that you know the you have to get you

917
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,320
have to get bigger you know yeah

918
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,119
um so anyway they uh

919
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,980
um but yeah that's that's roughly how

920
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,720
you would do something like that yeah

921
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,240
you know and then you want me to pick

922
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,618
something out for you yeah you go ahead

923
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,559
and fire off some traits I'll write it

924
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,240
down fire off some traits and I'll do it

925
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,000
from the Femme angle

926
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,739
from the Femme angle

927
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,420
you do regular too but I just figured

928
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:37,919
I'd do family no no you should do film

929
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,440
because because that's that's more

930
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,380
direct and it's easier for people to to

931
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,880
get right so I I wanted to like the main

932
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,160
reason I wanted to do it was I wanted to

933
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,380
illustrate people how hard it truly is

934
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,139
to be able to say my seeds are going to

935
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,519
deliver XYZ and to be consistent with

936
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:54,960
what they say they're delivering if

937
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,880
there's a lot more that goes into it

938
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,199
than just I'm gonna make a cross and

939
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,400
these things smell like this and that's

940
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,679
the way the seeds are going to come out

941
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,539
it's just not one way one way for people

942
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,358
one way for people to look at it is like

943
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,858
how genetics work is uh when you're

944
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,319
Crossing two things that are pretty

945
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:12,900
simple or especially things that are

946
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,338
widely Divergent from one another

947
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,180
um like say for instance Neville

948
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:20,940
Crossing nl5 and Haze uh or me Crossing

949
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,858
maple and Mendo P like you can see the

950
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,420
differences because there's certain

951
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:25,858
things to look for like if Neville's

952
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,720
growing some [ __ ] and it's super tall

953
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:30,420
and thin leafed and grows like a tree

954
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,699
it's hazy yeah it stays short and wide

955
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,858
leaved and Afghan and stout and you know

956
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:37,319
all that that it's probably nl5 Haze

957
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:38,940
yeah you know and for Mike the hybrid I

958
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,338
was talking about you can look at purple

959
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,800
you know and and some of the traits that

960
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:45,659
are unique to Mendo Pete but

961
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,940
um if you cross things that are similar

962
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:50,699
to each other it can be a real pain in

963
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,099
the ass yeah to try to figure out which

964
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:54,118
one leans what way which one's breeding

965
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,940
which way

966
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,700
you know exactly you know and so there's

967
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,338
there's an aspect there where

968
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:05,639
um I guess what I'm saying is that we

969
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:08,820
have entered the era where most things

970
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:11,819
are like a mass hodgepodge unless you go

971
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,740
older strains yeah it's a big mix of

972
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,380
genetics these days

973
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,000
right and so people start putting these

974
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,180
things together and you try to put like

975
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,599
a whatever you know like a freaking

976
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:27,059
um cush mitts you know by sour sour dub

977
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,740
two things with like huge histories what

978
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:31,139
could you get

979
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,479
you get a mass amount of [ __ ] right yeah

980
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:36,838
oh yes yes yes with those two especially

981
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,940
cush mitts and yeah and the sour doves

982
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,380
not too uncomplicated or whatever right

983
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,539
so

984
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,740
um so let's say let's let's say you were

985
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:45,539
gonna hunt something

986
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:48,118
right

987
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:50,338
um you know what are you gonna hunt so

988
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,760
what what kind of traits do you want say

989
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:55,679
you're a customer and you're buying for

990
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,880
some big Corporation and they have these

991
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,559
certain wants you may you don't even

992
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,119
have to want them but someone wants

993
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,338
these and you're giving the direction on

994
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,079
what these traits are that they want

995
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:07,619
okay so they want something that's going

996
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:12,300
to be high yielding yield okay high THC

997
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:14,700
potency high THC potency yeah got it can

998
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:19,800
can go up to 10 weeks

999
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:20,598
up to 10 weeks up to 10 weeks yeah and

1000
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,000
um

1001
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,599
and let's see here give me three more

1002
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,300
give you three more all right and then

1003
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,760
so uh I don't want to say purple because

1004
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,880
I just did that or whatever but

1005
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,940
um let's just say that it has to have

1006
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,940
um

1007
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:46,019
it has to have citrus turps

1008
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,740
hahaha

1009
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:51,659
okay what and wash well because they're

1010
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,819
because they want those those High

1011
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:56,460
yielding Citrus extracts as well as that

1012
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,579
okay and so what do we got now we got

1013
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,760
it's got a yield well one more

1014
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:05,900
field well high THC up to 10 weeks

1015
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,900
Citrus wash as well

1016
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,040
hi GNC wash as well that should pretty

1017
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,960
much cover it I'll give you those okay

1018
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,019
okay

1019
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,019
um

1020
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,039
the high THC let's see

1021
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,539
I'm gonna give myself a little more

1022
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,279
complex I'm gonna have I'm going to give

1023
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,619
it density because otherwise I would

1024
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,440
just say I just threw that in I mean as

1025
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:31,680
long as it yielded well yeah and and

1026
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,240
wash as well I don't think the [ __ ] I

1027
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,480
don't think the client is gonna give a

1028
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,939
[ __ ] yeah I would like this this like it

1029
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,599
would be probably lemon G or like lemon

1030
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,000
G something like lemon tree

1031
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,400
um but if I were gonna make a femme line

1032
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,619
from scratch without the obvious [ __ ]

1033
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,880
and also leaving out like cookies and OG

1034
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,980
and stuff like that and I'm not I'm

1035
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,660
gonna remove lemon G because it's just

1036
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,980
too obvious

1037
00:39:54,659 --> 00:40:02,059
and with Citrus let's see here

1038
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,059
I'm gonna go

1039
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,679
I'm gonna go

1040
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:19,019
one second c99 grapefruit

1041
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:22,500
as the start and as the base oh man

1042
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:25,259
there you go on the male side because I

1043
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,880
know that this is the dominant

1044
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,859
um oh wait no I'm not doing me I'm doing

1045
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,019
female but so it's even easier yeah but

1046
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:34,319
it's also the dominant

1047
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:35,759
uh uh scent expression from c99 the seed

1048
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,579
lines going around so it's going to be

1049
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,920
more commonly occurring so when I'm

1050
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:44,339
choosing this female and it's showing

1051
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,559
that has a citrus grapefruit Terps it'll

1052
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,599
likely also breed for those knowing c99

1053
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,578
well like I do so we know we've got that

1054
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,680
covered but we also know c99 is like a

1055
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,780
seven to eight weaker so we've we can

1056
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,338
allow ourselves to bring up the THC with

1057
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,339
something a little more

1058
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:58,338
um

1059
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:04,799
a little more typically sativa end

1060
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:09,899
I would do

1061
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,720
I would do a a clone from Appalachia

1062
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,800
all right Appalachia Green Crack Trey

1063
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,199
dog

1064
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,420
we've got the potency you got the wash

1065
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,059
well you got somebody actually just said

1066
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,760
Appalachia by scene at the time yeah in

1067
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,380
the comments hilarious

1068
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,180
they nailed it that's that's what I

1069
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,000
would do

1070
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:31,319
a good cut like a a green crack Dominic

1071
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,559
cut with a little bit of gas of

1072
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:38,579
Appalachia and to a c99 grapefruit

1073
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:42,838
reversal and I would probably you know

1074
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:45,359
uh do it under metal halides on tables

1075
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:48,838
small plants

1076
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,880
um more plants uh in numbers for the

1077
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,980
reversal as opposed to bigger plants I'd

1078
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,619
want smaller and more

1079
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,619
and yeah that's how I do it

1080
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,140
that's how you do it no c99 doesn't wash

1081
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:03,900
super well but Green Crack washed pretty

1082
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:06,000
good and uh I believe Appalachia will

1083
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,260
too especially because the tray dog and

1084
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,838
I mean the other thing that you could do

1085
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,960
too is that if it ended up not washing

1086
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:16,440
well then you could have a c99

1087
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,019
Appalachia hybrid that gave you some

1088
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,900
Citrus and some Bag appeal and some

1089
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,880
weight you know and and was going to

1090
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,460
come in within the time and he could go

1091
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,260
another step let's say he failed yes

1092
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,579
right let's say that failed let's say

1093
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,980
that got you high yielding plants right

1094
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:37,320
that had some citrus

1095
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,500
um but it didn't wash very well yes but

1096
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,980
you got high potency high yield and you

1097
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,960
had Citrus yes but you're short

1098
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,519
one they're trying to they're trying to

1099
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,079
run it they're trying to they're trying

1100
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,940
to make ice water they're doing all this

1101
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,320
different stuff BHO and it's just coming

1102
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,599
out at a percentage it's not making

1103
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,740
their extraction happy yeah so now you

1104
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,660
need another step

1105
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,059
I need one more step for resin

1106
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:01,559
production I'm going to cheat and go for

1107
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:04,318
the white

1108
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:07,920
the white you're gonna go for the white

1109
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:10,440
the classic boost resin production uh

1110
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,659
the Terps aren't that great but I've

1111
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,059
seen it combine well with stuff that is

1112
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:17,098
really dominant like c99

1113
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,199
so I'd probably add the white in there

1114
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,780
because it was also it also has that

1115
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,318
that huge bag appeal and and it does

1116
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:28,319
have good THC do you think the c99

1117
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:30,779
Citrus is strong enough that it would

1118
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,179
carry through in a lot of those hybrids

1119
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,800
still and still be dominant I do I think

1120
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,539
you can't wash it out I think it's kind

1121
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,619
of like deep chunk one of those so you

1122
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:39,779
think it would be it would be one of

1123
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:42,358
those things where like the the sheer

1124
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,480
blandness of the white yep wouldn't

1125
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:48,980
dominate yep

1126
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:55,579
so then we'd have a a

1127
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:59,699
c99 by uh by Appalachia by the White

1128
00:43:55,579 --> 00:44:00,839
Appalachia uh c99 White yeah because

1129
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:02,039
that's the way I do it except reverse

1130
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,299
the white because I also know the white

1131
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,440
reverse as well that was the other thing

1132
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,760
I was thinking all right so that's the

1133
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,838
other part is you can get a failed

1134
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,400
reversal

1135
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,739
and I know the white reverses well

1136
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,880
Rascal did it consistently I've done it

1137
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:17,338
a few times so it's a good one

1138
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,500
interesting I mean I uh

1139
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:20,940
and that ladies and gentlemen is when

1140
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,400
you start talking to corporate guys

1141
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,559
about what they want why things like

1142
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,880
Jack Herer and Jack Herrera hybrids are

1143
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,460
blended into everything because they're

1144
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,660
like I want three pounds of light gotta

1145
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,960
look pretty

1146
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:35,759
It's gotta be quick you know I want to

1147
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,920
sativa high and it's got to be eight

1148
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,619
weeks yeah and so then they're like oh

1149
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,200
c99 Jack Herrera like I remember when

1150
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,780
Colorado I was gonna make fun of you but

1151
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:48,598
I held off when Colorado went legal

1152
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,760
think like I remember that everybody was

1153
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,599
getting three pounds of light but it was

1154
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,960
all hybrids of Jack Herrera Durban

1155
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,338
Poison green crack and there was one

1156
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,460
more because there was anything that

1157
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:04,500
threw like big long forearms golden

1158
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,960
goats yeah and then they would just

1159
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,219
hybridize things looking for Finos that

1160
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,380
they would get three pounds of light

1161
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,118
yeah you know and so everything was

1162
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,858
crossed like one of those four things

1163
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,358
because they all looked at it from like

1164
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:18,420
mathematics

1165
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,699
you know I think um I think uh

1166
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,780
realistically why c99 still is popular

1167
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:27,899
today even easy even more so than um

1168
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:30,180
even more so than Jack Herrera even I

1169
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,858
think c99 still dominates is because of

1170
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:33,960
the outdoor scene in California and

1171
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:35,219
because of that demand for a sativa type

1172
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,099
that's super fast flowering that

1173
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:39,480
finishes in time in NorCal and I tend to

1174
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:42,059
think Appalachia is going to be what

1175
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,920
totally wipes c99 out when enough people

1176
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:46,739
run it it had a good it had it had it

1177
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,818
run for a while uh by a high-end loan so

1178
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,098
when he originally made it and then

1179
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:52,199
Bodhi did a bunch of crosses with it but

1180
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,599
um I still think it's got It's it's a

1181
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:57,719
big run coming Jack does carry the

1182
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,599
terpenolene Terps for Generations yep

1183
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:03,118
you know uh Green Crack is actually a

1184
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,619
really nice strain grown well yeah most

1185
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,000
people have got a bad name because there

1186
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:08,280
was a bunch of people that would grow

1187
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,280
six to ten pound outdoor plants kind of

1188
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,440
be great of it and got blown out but

1189
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,579
if you grow a nice little four to eight

1190
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,740
ounce plant

1191
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,500
and and you know and you treat it right

1192
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:21,179
it's got some nice Terps it's got a

1193
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,599
sweet high it's not like knock you out

1194
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:26,759
like but it's it's pretty you know it

1195
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,859
might be my like if it is mostly skunk

1196
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,579
one it might be my favorite example of

1197
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:34,019
Scotland yeah yeah I would say like just

1198
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,180
the way sometimes like when it comes out

1199
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:39,420
really nice the bud is really green and

1200
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:42,118
the the crystal is really silvery

1201
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:45,240
you know and it's it's got a nice sweet

1202
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:48,000
terp to it yeah there's a good chance it

1203
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,739
might be a Mendo perp skunk one of sorts

1204
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,858
I I do think that

1205
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:55,139
Green Crack yeah holy [ __ ] that would

1206
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:56,460
trip me out yeah I mean it's mango

1207
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:58,318
Turkey

1208
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,519
um it's very purple with even the

1209
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,500
slightest bit of cold but I mean it's

1210
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,300
like black people say where can I find

1211
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,639
it that's the thing is that real Green

1212
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,200
Crack was so common that and all of a

1213
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,379
sudden it's like really hard to find the

1214
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,838
real one yes and you know it got renamed

1215
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,519
honestly in like the people just read

1216
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:17,880
its name people because real because

1217
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:19,858
Green Crack got a bad name like Brokers

1218
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,200
put off on it but then when the extract

1219
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,420
era happened I'm convinced that there's

1220
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:25,559
a bunch of papaya that's just [ __ ]

1221
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,720
green crack

1222
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,480
they could be yeah you know I'm not

1223
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,759
saying 100 all of it but like when you

1224
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,280
extract green crack and you wash it it

1225
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,380
has nice tropical fruit Terps some

1226
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,300
people get papaya some people get mango

1227
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,180
some people get whiffs of other things

1228
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:45,180
depending on their nose or whatever

1229
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:49,440
um but you know it it has that similar

1230
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:51,598
profile yeah in that regard you know but

1231
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,220
I I think because of certain traits

1232
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,780
there's a good chance that mental

1233
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:56,399
purpose then to be in that lineage I'm

1234
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,380
surprised you'd never noticed that one I

1235
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,700
would I would honestly trip out if that

1236
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,220
was the I mean I've been wrong before

1237
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,439
yeah I'll I'll say that and we've had

1238
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:06,719
good friends of ours that that told me

1239
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,940
things that I was just like oh no and

1240
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:12,299
then later on I was like whoa whoa you

1241
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,579
know so it's it's possible but

1242
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,680
um you know I the story of that one is

1243
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:18,000
pretty mysterious it is very mysterious

1244
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,899
because there's

1245
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,338
um the tale of of Cecil and when I when

1246
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,818
I first encountered it was through

1247
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:29,578
through uh James Hall he had green crack

1248
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:31,318
but we had it labeled as green Kush with

1249
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:34,079
a c in our room and it actually said

1250
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,358
green like written out cushed with the

1251
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,800
sea so because of that when I first went

1252
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,199
online people were talking about how

1253
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,000
well Cecil C has a Kush with the c so

1254
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:43,858
for a long time me and Cecil tried to

1255
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,539
meet up so we could talk about this

1256
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:47,279
stuff and figure it out and when we

1257
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:49,619
finally talked it sounds like his Kush

1258
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,180
with the sea was very skunky like he

1259
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,000
says the one that he sent to San Diego

1260
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:55,559
was very skunky which is not like the

1261
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,059
green crack or the green Kush that was

1262
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:58,739
in San Diego

1263
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,480
um I don't know if it originates in San

1264
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:03,239
Diego I don't know if it originates in

1265
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,920
Mendo or up up in Humboldt it could be

1266
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,719
from freaking Oregon for all we know

1267
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,480
with a different name I know it made it

1268
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,639
to SoCal with the name uh bring Kush

1269
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,800
with the scene oh yeah and then became

1270
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:15,179
Green Crack after that people are

1271
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,740
throwing around different things people

1272
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:18,838
are asking like well how do you Source

1273
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:20,098
what you're breeding with and to be

1274
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,139
honest

1275
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,579
um you know like I never really did a

1276
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,858
bunch of breeding projects where I had

1277
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,039
to go out and like have a treasure your

1278
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:30,299
map and find the things I wanted

1279
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:32,579
mostly you end up reading with stuff you

1280
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,140
have access to yeah let's be real we

1281
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:36,359
were creating a hypothetical situation

1282
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:38,759
and I tend to have a so I tended to pick

1283
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:40,679
things in my library not hypothetical

1284
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,599
things I'd have to get but like actual

1285
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:44,879
things that I possess yeah because

1286
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,160
that's just where my mind goes right it

1287
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,660
would be infinitely harder to like be

1288
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,219
like oh well I need to do a project

1289
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:51,719
that's going to take three or four steps

1290
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:53,459
and I need to gather

1291
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,919
a bunch of different things that are

1292
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,300
going to be new to me yeah you know and

1293
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,400
there's an aspect people are talking

1294
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,440
about I don't think philosophilos can't

1295
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,660
actually determine family relationships

1296
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,659
the way that we help okay one day one

1297
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:09,239
day we will sit down and a few of us

1298
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:13,019
will tell the story about how we put

1299
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:15,358
philos's science to the test by using

1300
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,539
known clones known parentage of these

1301
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,858
clones and submitted them to filos to

1302
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:21,318
see if they could truly determine

1303
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:23,460
parentage

1304
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,960
yeah there's an aspect too where people

1305
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,760
are saying green crack and blue dream

1306
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,940
got played out right at the same time

1307
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,680
yeah there's there's an aspect you know

1308
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,079
because I live in Mendocino County or

1309
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,139
whatever like and for a long time it was

1310
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,000
sort of like the heart of of uh you know

1311
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:40,618
outdoor and stuff in California before

1312
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,139
it spread

1313
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:44,760
um a lot of times you would have plants

1314
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,559
that were really nice on their own like

1315
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,359
the blue dream or the green crack or the

1316
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,420
berry white or the this or whatever it

1317
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:53,759
might be and they get there's an era

1318
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,260
where like they're really popular and

1319
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,180
they're and they're moving really well

1320
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,220
and their people are growing really nice

1321
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,719
examples of them and then there's a

1322
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:02,098
point where people realize how much

1323
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,618
money they can make and they can throw

1324
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:06,780
out 99 plants and get eight pounds of

1325
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:08,579
plant and you do the math and so all of

1326
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,920
a sudden there's all this B and C grade

1327
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:13,440
of the same strain and it kind of

1328
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,559
harshes the strain out so a lot of times

1329
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,659
people will be like oh that strain sucks

1330
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,300
and really what happened is the market

1331
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:23,399
got exploded by a bunch of low quality

1332
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,318
enormous waves of it because it was

1333
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,680
super profitable

1334
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:31,318
um and then the you know the you know it

1335
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,598
moves on and so people move on you grow

1336
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:35,279
a little four ounce plant of green crack

1337
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,059
or blue dream you'd probably be prepared

1338
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,500
happy yeah yeah you grow it nice you

1339
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:42,359
know you grow a little three four ounce

1340
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,039
plan of it like you'd probably be stoked

1341
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,920
and so are your buddies

1342
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,900
Blue Dream because I was still very

1343
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,700
heavily involved in the seed seed

1344
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,338
business when Blue Dream got real big

1345
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:55,679
and all that got blown up and uh what I

1346
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:58,078
saw happen right before my eyes was

1347
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,000
there was a few of us that made s1s of

1348
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,180
that original cut and released it in

1349
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,900
some good hybrids and then we saw

1350
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:08,759
major Spanish companies making seed

1351
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,280
lines called blue dream that had nothing

1352
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,859
to do with blue dream to cut they would

1353
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,019
combine like a blueberry and their hazes

1354
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:18,719
whatever they had and put that on the

1355
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:20,818
market and uh I don't want to name any

1356
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,439
names or anything but certain companies

1357
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:24,179
would buy these import them to the US

1358
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,579
and all of a sudden these Blue Dream

1359
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:28,199
seeds were everywhere the attitude was

1360
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,460
doing giveaways with everything you

1361
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:32,699
bought you would get these Blue Dream

1362
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,500
seeds so blue dream hit the country in

1363
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:36,779
Mass but it wasn't blue dream it was

1364
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,760
blueberry haze from some Spanish company

1365
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,440
with uh with the California Market

1366
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,720
getting the majority of the actual Blue

1367
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,880
Dream bus right and I mean there's an

1368
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:49,019
aspect too where I think that for most

1369
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,900
plants there's a window of uh of quality

1370
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,699
yeah you know it it varies plant to

1371
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,260
plant but I actually think a lot of the

1372
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:57,118
indoor look

1373
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,040
is just because people are growing

1374
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,380
relatively small plants compared to

1375
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,380
outside and yeah you know

1376
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,818
so you're only asking a plant to give

1377
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:10,500
you say like one to eight ounces it'll

1378
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,880
have a vastly different look than if

1379
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,858
you're asking that plant to give you a

1380
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,500
pound or two pounds or three pounds or

1381
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:18,420
eight pounds right yeah

1382
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,579
um and I've had I've had times where it

1383
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,740
was like when we were transplanting and

1384
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:25,318
stuff like some plants got broken off at

1385
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:27,358
the stem yeah you know and so not used

1386
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:28,639
and so I would grow these like depths

1387
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,500
and these plants would get like a pound

1388
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,838
and then like helpers wouldn't want to

1389
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,000
throw away the ones we broke so there'd

1390
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,619
be like a branch this Bay a stem this

1391
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,318
big with a few branches coming off it

1392
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,960
and when we pulled that stuff down that

1393
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,539
little stuff looks so amazing compared

1394
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,519
to compared to like the the rest of it

1395
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:49,800
because it was like three ounces

1396
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,239
yeah and it was just super Frosty and

1397
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,760
choked out so there's an aspect

1398
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:55,739
certainly with different plants of like

1399
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,380
there's a size sweet spot

1400
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,058
yeah where you get it I like blue dream

1401
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,619
at four to six ounces that's where it

1402
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:04,440
was like just [ __ ] perfect every

1403
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:06,358
[ __ ] time most weed is if it's gonna

1404
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,300
be good weed you know that's a decent

1405
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:11,098
that it can it can get that big you know

1406
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,780
uh some plants can get to a half pound

1407
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:14,760
some plants can get to a pound but

1408
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,640
there's a there's a point of diminishing

1409
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,440
quality yeah absolutely you know where

1410
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:20,940
it's like the resin doesn't stretch or

1411
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,818
the Terps don't stretch or the plant

1412
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,159
just has to put so much energy into its

1413
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:27,779
stem and its structure and it's how it's

1414
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,078
going to survive it doesn't have enough

1415
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,300
to put into you know it's the quality of

1416
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,339
its weed yeah I mean there's people that

1417
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,780
swear that small little plants in one

1418
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:40,139
gallon pots

1419
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:43,800
you know or or is the headiest wheat

1420
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:47,159
yeah that's I know that um when CSI was

1421
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,300
talking about shabad's uh sour that he

1422
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,759
talks about as like some of the best

1423
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,740
Smokies ever had out of the millions of

1424
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,480
plants he's probably smoked

1425
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:56,759
um he always says that you know it was

1426
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,679
in a one gallon pot and flour or power

1427
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,500
flower and that's it

1428
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,719
yeah I mean so there's an aspect there's

1429
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,358
an aspect there where it's like you I

1430
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:09,318
mean I used to actually do uh a bunch of

1431
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:12,539
breeding that way right once I got smart

1432
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:14,400
uh smarter I said I I suppose I should

1433
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,219
say because I used to just grow up all

1434
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,019
these [ __ ] seeds and granted the era

1435
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:20,459
was different but still you get all this

1436
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:22,380
random weed that you didn't like very

1437
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,519
much yeah because let's face it when

1438
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,720
you're breeding it's like you're only

1439
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:29,219
gonna like so much of it yeah you know

1440
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,439
and then I got smart instead of like

1441
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:33,899
blooming the seeds I would grow them up

1442
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,119
and I would take cuts and I would put

1443
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,800
them into like a one gallon pot and I

1444
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:42,000
would grow like on a you know I might

1445
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,160
grow like 50 or 100 plants on a 4x8

1446
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,338
and I'm just going for like a single

1447
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:49,500
stock try to get a half ounce yeah but

1448
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:51,058
that half ounce will tell me does it

1449
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,760
have the Terps does it have the high

1450
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:56,220
that's enough smoke and then maybe I can

1451
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,720
grow out a hundred things at once and

1452
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:59,338
it's small enough to still know you're

1453
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:00,539
getting the quality the ultimate quality

1454
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:02,219
that you can get from that plant without

1455
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:03,779
having to push it hard yeah and you're

1456
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:05,338
starting from a clone because that's the

1457
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,960
other thing that I realized is like a

1458
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:09,239
lot of times I wanted to see like what a

1459
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,280
clone would do yeah because you only get

1460
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:13,379
one shot at the seat yeah you only ever

1461
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,960
see that seat one yeah it's got a Tap

1462
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:17,818
Root it's gonna act differently yeah so

1463
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,740
I got more consistent when I just like

1464
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:21,779
when I would just take I would breed and

1465
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:23,939
I would I wouldn't flour the seed plants

1466
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,500
I would flower the Clones

1467
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,000
yeah I would want to see what they did

1468
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,858
as clones and then I could flower almost

1469
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,139
like a sea of green Style

1470
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:33,058
and then you could have 100 or 150

1471
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:36,299
things and if they're like you know 10

1472
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:37,079
to 20 ounce 10 to 20 grams each maybe a

1473
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,180
zip

1474
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:40,079
yeah and that's one thing that's one

1475
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:41,940
thing I've been trying to teach

1476
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,300
everybody that's watched like breeder

1477
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:47,579
Syndicate or my my live streams uh since

1478
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,740
I started doing them is when you buy

1479
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:51,539
seeds when you buy seeds and you're

1480
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,039
popping seeds you know a lot of people

1481
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:53,579
run into

1482
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,739
um

1483
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:57,839
sexual instability issues all kinds of

1484
00:56:55,739 --> 00:56:59,039
other issues or they like it the one

1485
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,380
time and they don't like it the rest and

1486
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,659
they don't understand why you know I

1487
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,700
always tell them I always say don't

1488
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:07,920
worry about blooming the mom don't worry

1489
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:09,239
about blooming the seed mom Bloom the

1490
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Clone mom because that's what you're

1491
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,779
gonna see every time and that's what

1492
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,858
matters that's what that's what matters

1493
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,400
that's where you need to make your

1494
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:19,558
choices from and it'll at 99 of the time

1495
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,720
any sexual instability issues are gone

1496
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,280
with the Clone 99 time for whatever

1497
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:25,558
reason that's how it works it's just

1498
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,480
different hormones so yeah but yeah I

1499
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:30,599
mean I used to get two ounces four

1500
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,800
ounces five ounces eight ounces all

1501
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,200
these different plants all these

1502
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,818
different sizes all all that and like

1503
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,199
it's hard to do that but you can

1504
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:39,058
actually go through a bunch of plants

1505
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,118
and you really don't need to me you

1506
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:43,920
really don't need more than you know 10

1507
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,019
or 20 grams should give you like a

1508
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,180
really good idea yeah whether or not

1509
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:50,759
which ones you like enough to like work

1510
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:52,019
with again yeah and that's good that

1511
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,300
could be done on one or two four by

1512
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:56,519
eights yeah it doesn't even take that

1513
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,920
much you know and then you and then you

1514
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:00,300
know I would just toss the seat mom and

1515
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,858
I would just keep clunk you know

1516
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,599
clones's back up

1517
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:05,639
yeah and as soon as they grew a little

1518
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,920
bit just flip them and I wanted to see

1519
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:10,318
like what the main the main stem would

1520
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,780
do wouldn't top them just try to get

1521
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:16,800
Spears yeah relatively speaking Yeah

1522
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,780
I mean it's not the only way to do it

1523
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,920
but it is a way for people a lot of

1524
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,559
people these days are going to have

1525
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,599
smaller size areas to work with and then

1526
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,740
if you did that into a greenhouse you

1527
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,119
could look what you could look through

1528
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:29,699
three or four hundred plants if you

1529
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,920
wanted yeah but the hard part is going

1530
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:34,980
to be testing it

1531
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,599
is always labeling drying it keeping it

1532
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,099
separate I mean you know Caleb he's got

1533
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:41,039
[ __ ] hangers with all kinds of

1534
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,599
color-coded labels on them and notes and

1535
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,338
[ __ ] and then you're trying to keep them

1536
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,619
all separate and different plastic bag

1537
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:48,599
or different jars or whatever

1538
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:51,780
and then you're trying to like smoke and

1539
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:54,960
take notes so let's talk about like the

1540
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,760
the downside of doing too big of a pop

1541
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,858
that's what I was just saying you know

1542
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,380
it's like how do you you know like

1543
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:04,019
there's an aspect of like

1544
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,000
um doing too big of a pump

1545
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:07,019
is cool in the sense that when you're

1546
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,179
looking for certain physical

1547
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:10,798
characteristics you're going through

1548
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:13,379
more faster

1549
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,920
yeah right and so you can you can you

1550
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,960
can sift through but then you know

1551
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,460
um you know smoke testing let's say you

1552
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,159
have 50 things

1553
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,059
100 things smoke testing all that takes

1554
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,879
a while

1555
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:29,160
and you usually got to engage friends

1556
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,720
yeah let's say you have 13 000 things

1557
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:35,098
though

1558
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:37,439
that was yeah I mean that was uh at that

1559
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:39,059
point you're not really Fino I mean

1560
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,940
you're you're not really Fino hunting

1561
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:44,099
you're doing some Fino hunting but you

1562
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:47,280
realize that like the vast majority of

1563
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:49,079
it it's gonna get lost to time yeah you

1564
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,519
know there's any time I mean you know we

1565
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:53,579
have a pretty big thing going right now

1566
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:55,380
with some of Caleb's work and it's it's

1567
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:58,680
like we really get to see what's in the

1568
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:00,240
line yeah and how it expresses right but

1569
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,940
the vast majority of them are going to

1570
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,858
be kept for any reason yeah vast

1571
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,780
majority can't be smoked I mean it's

1572
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:08,098
just to get to that like if you're let's

1573
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:10,980
say you're popping

1574
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:12,539
two thousand like how are you gonna

1575
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,440
smoke that within a certain amount of

1576
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:15,480
period unless you just have people

1577
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,400
cheaping for free all day and those

1578
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,740
[ __ ] don't go away you know

1579
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,599
yeah I mean there's an aspect where

1580
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:23,098
really like for a hobby Gardener I mean

1581
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,920
a lot of depending on how people smoke

1582
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:28,619
even if you did 60 or 70 things

1583
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,599
it would take you you know if you smoked

1584
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:32,880
two or three of them a day

1585
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:35,640
you know it would take you you know

1586
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,980
almost a month yeah to sort through it

1587
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:39,659
yeah and so you know

1588
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,400
um you know and then you could also have

1589
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:43,078
certain kinds of criteria maybe some

1590
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,180
things you smoke one bowl of and it

1591
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,099
doesn't have the flavor it you don't

1592
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:49,739
like it you just immediately you know

1593
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:52,318
but then it's like how fine of a comb

1594
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:54,118
yeah you know

1595
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:56,279
um people say cut a clone latent flower

1596
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,960
you know there's a lot of uh there's a

1597
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,900
lot of Euros that don't like to keep

1598
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,760
backup clones and they'll literally do

1599
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,920
this thing where they'll leave all the

1600
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,119
bottoms on their plants and they'll

1601
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,159
Bloom them

1602
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:10,920
and their favorites they'll just like

1603
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:14,940
move before the plant's fully finished

1604
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,380
and re-vege the bottoms yeah you know

1605
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,380
the problem with that that there's

1606
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:21,180
nothing wrong with that method

1607
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,519
um because a lot of times the easiest

1608
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:26,759
things to re-vege are like the poorly

1609
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:29,639
floured out uh you know wispy [ __ ] on

1610
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:33,420
the bottom so you can cut a plant down

1611
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:35,759
and smoke it and be re-veging it

1612
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,920
um but it does take months

1613
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,559
it does it takes a few months for it to

1614
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,480
start kicking back yeah it's like I did

1615
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,960
it a ton for a long time

1616
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,358
um when I would do uh uh final hunts

1617
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,358
because I would try to do as big of a

1618
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:53,519
Fino hunt as I could do in with as many

1619
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,199
different lines and what usually ended

1620
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:57,480
up happening was that I couldn't keep

1621
01:01:55,199 --> 01:02:00,058
you know four clones of every single

1622
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,338
thing that I was hunting through so I

1623
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:04,440
had to get really good at reveging I had

1624
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:06,058
to get it right every [ __ ] time and

1625
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,318
figure out how to do that and eventually

1626
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:09,480
I figured out how to do that and be

1627
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:12,358
consistent with it but it's hard and it

1628
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,679
takes a long [ __ ] time my buddy I was

1629
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:15,420
mentioning that I did the maple project

1630
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,338
he was he that he was just saying he

1631
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,440
does 50 60 things at a time and it's a

1632
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:21,298
[ __ ] yeah you know it's like you have

1633
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,519
lives it's not that easy to like it's

1634
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:25,920
one thing to get baked every day it's

1635
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,559
another thing to like take notes and see

1636
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,059
how you feel and you know be looking for

1637
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,460
certain aspects of things so you either

1638
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:35,460
have to be a super harsh dick or It

1639
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:38,220
Takes a Minute yeah you know

1640
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,119
um and and so and a lot of times what

1641
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:42,659
sucks

1642
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:44,400
you know is that uh you know the runty

1643
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:45,659
shitty [ __ ] up plant that you almost

1644
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,639
killed

1645
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:50,098
ends up being the most interesting one

1646
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,598
to smoke and flavor yeah and all the

1647
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,519
ones that had all the structure and

1648
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,640
growth and vigor that you wanted where

1649
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:58,858
where just you know okay compared to

1650
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,298
some of those other ones yeah it's

1651
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,679
always the scrawny shitty one that

1652
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:02,940
doesn't want to re-vege the most

1653
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:05,159
stubborn one that's usually the one I

1654
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,679
want to keep yeah I mean obviously I

1655
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:09,899
like those I mean imagine imagine if you

1656
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,639
know the OG craze happened but like OG

1657
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,619
grew like blue dream

1658
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:15,000
yeah

1659
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,300
there really would be blue dream

1660
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,139
billionaires

1661
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,839
[Laughter]

1662
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:23,400
you know and all that because it's like

1663
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:25,019
that but that's the that's the kind of

1664
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,920
intro maybe we could talk about that for

1665
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:28,500
a minute

1666
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,358
um because well it's interesting is that

1667
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,699
I was talking about like when things

1668
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:34,440
went legal in Colorado and all of a

1669
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:36,239
sudden all these high-yielding plants

1670
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,838
started getting bred into all the indoor

1671
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:42,058
because that's what met the model yeah

1672
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:45,719
there is a risk uh as Things become

1673
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:48,420
legal that the weird runty [ __ ] up

1674
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:52,199
offshoots that we all know and love that

1675
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,880
end up becoming like our Elites get cold

1676
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:57,000
yeah because they don't meet the

1677
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,579
production model well I remember

1678
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,460
um even even when subcool was at the

1679
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:04,200
height of of breeding Fame I would call

1680
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:05,760
it even what he would what he had what I

1681
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:08,639
would call his genuine Fame at one point

1682
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,799
that dude was pretty famous and um he

1683
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,078
was putting it out there

1684
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:15,179
um

1685
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:17,579
my [ __ ] I'm gonna interrupt then for a

1686
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:19,440
second uh go ahead our homie from Hawaii

1687
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:21,240
was saying taking Cuts two or three

1688
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,579
weeks into flower is nice they stay

1689
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:25,639
small and about the time they re-veg

1690
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:29,220
you're finishing up the round

1691
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:31,318
That's What CSI does a whole bunch uh

1692
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:33,239
his primary method is to take clones

1693
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:35,699
clean up the bottoms about two weeks

1694
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:37,618
into into bloom

1695
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:39,719
um and then that and then that slows

1696
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:41,640
down and they freak out for a while but

1697
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:43,919
they kind of are on the same timing as

1698
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:46,078
your room so around the time you figure

1699
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,420
out which ones are good

1700
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,680
um or hope you know they're because they

1701
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,659
get because you can get them too big and

1702
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:53,940
then you're chopping them back

1703
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:56,098
yeah I was gonna say sub cool he would

1704
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:59,039
call a lot of seeds in the seedling

1705
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:01,500
stage like in the seedling stains he

1706
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,420
would do major culling and I was always

1707
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,159
a big opponent of that because I found

1708
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,619
that like a lot of the slower gray stuff

1709
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:09,358
can be just as amazing a Keepers for

1710
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:11,400
different reasons you know but for a

1711
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:12,900
while that that was in cannabis and

1712
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:16,380
still kind of is a common thought that

1713
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:18,059
if it's weak as a Seedling call it well

1714
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,000
I mean there's nothing wrong with that

1715
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:22,798
in in a certain aspect but then it's

1716
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,318
just making it harder to find what you

1717
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:26,880
want because you're trying to guarantee

1718
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:29,219
that it's going to be in a strong and

1719
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,960
vigorous plan exactly and if there's one

1720
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:33,078
thing we know about cannabis is that

1721
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,579
like the week the weak shitty ones

1722
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:38,280
sometimes have a tendency of being like

1723
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,318
the Market's favorite yeah OG Kush I

1724
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,240
can't even believe that wasn't called at

1725
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,639
the beginning just to how floppy limbed

1726
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,798
and it has so many traits that that are

1727
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,298
hard hard to grow I mean let's talk

1728
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,119
about you know do you know the thing

1729
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:53,420
that I will put this number one all time

1730
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,440
I can't believe it was called

1731
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:00,000
the quays

1732
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:02,338
oh yeah yeah the wild one how how can

1733
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,460
you grow something that takes that long

1734
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:08,519
and every bud is like a tiny fingernail

1735
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,260
sized [ __ ] calyx Ripper yeah and it

1736
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:13,500
becomes one of the more famous strains

1737
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:14,940
in in Holland uh that was a labor of

1738
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,559
love because there's a bunch of people

1739
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:20,220
that would look at that halfway through

1740
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,319
and be like what a mess deaths so I I

1741
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:23,399
got Finos like that or expressions like

1742
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:25,579
that from

1743
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:30,660
um Alaskan ice seeds that I purchased

1744
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:32,160
from uh seed Madness I want to say in

1745
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,159
the UK

1746
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,899
um yeah it spit out females like that

1747
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,980
and they were immediately called like I

1748
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,838
didn't think anything of it it was

1749
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,338
before I had ever seen or run the

1750
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:42,960
question yeah you would just kill it

1751
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:45,858
you'd be like this is super [ __ ] this

1752
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,179
is the worst thing ever this is horrible

1753
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:49,619
yeah this is [ __ ] ridiculous so you

1754
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:51,419
just kill it you know and that's

1755
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:53,818
actually what Neville did to about half

1756
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,619
his Haze seeds that popped yeah they

1757
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:57,119
were so sparse and [ __ ] up that he

1758
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,400
didn't realize what he had and he called

1759
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:02,160
him and then he smoked it uh and then

1760
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,539
yeah somebody was saying oh gkb OG KB is

1761
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,000
an excellent example of something that

1762
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:09,240
would never make a production model yeah

1763
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,539
super slow takes forever to badge

1764
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:14,759
doesn't yield that much you know all

1765
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:15,720
that and so I always think of tomatoes

1766
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,400
right

1767
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:19,739
because there's been this heirloom

1768
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,980
tomato sort of Renaissance in America

1769
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:24,538
yeah um but when people are like you go

1770
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,480
to the grocery store you see lots of

1771
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:31,079
delicious vegetables or whatever but

1772
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:34,858
tomatoes are bred for size and weight

1773
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,559
and color and to not rot and to not

1774
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:39,420
split and flavor is way down there so

1775
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,880
the tomatoes that get stuffed into most

1776
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:44,099
people's grocery stores are like big

1777
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,380
money making watery

1778
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:48,660
it's like all the production values are

1779
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:50,338
Paramount yeah and the part where it's

1780
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:52,558
delicious and it tastes good and it has

1781
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:54,900
the flavors that we want like we can't

1782
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,220
force them to do that which is why a lot

1783
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:59,059
of people think store-bought Tomatoes

1784
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:01,558
stuff suck yeah

1785
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:03,599
so but what I mean by that well yeah but

1786
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:05,280
what I mean by that is that like as

1787
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,318
cannabis goes into a production model

1788
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,599
and they start looking at square footage

1789
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:11,579
and cost and yield and this and that and

1790
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,880
everything else there could be very

1791
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:17,880
different uh pressures put on what

1792
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,759
strains make it to the public yeah the

1793
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:23,100
OG would never have made it the ogkb

1794
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:24,659
would never have made it the qua the you

1795
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,699
know the quays would never have made it

1796
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:28,798
like there's a lot of varieties out

1797
01:08:26,698 --> 01:08:30,479
there for one reason or another that

1798
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:33,600
wouldn't fit somebody's production model

1799
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:35,519
yeah I was always surprised when cookie

1800
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,920
showed up like the form cut because it

1801
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,900
was so low yielding like so so low

1802
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,060
yielding uh compared to what was

1803
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:44,460
typically going around even even most OG

1804
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,600
cushions had been um they had figured

1805
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,460
them out to make them yield their

1806
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,520
cookies was just so yielding I was

1807
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:52,259
shocked that it ever uh got commercial

1808
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,540
viability I don't think it would have

1809
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:57,479
without I mean there was an aspect where

1810
01:08:54,539 --> 01:09:01,140
prices were starting to fall yeah and

1811
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:02,939
and Instagram was young and it was like

1812
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:05,520
a perfect moment where it gained a bunch

1813
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:07,198
of popularity and then it sold for high

1814
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,600
dollars so it was almost kind of like

1815
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:11,759
the same thing with Kush right like and

1816
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,140
our buddy resin it's like sure you might

1817
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,579
not get as much weight as you were

1818
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,679
getting off other things until you

1819
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:18,119
figured it out but if you were selling

1820
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,359
it for Seven Grand a pound you really

1821
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:23,039
didn't care yeah exactly you know that

1822
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,838
there was some there was some like oh I

1823
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,399
can get lower yields off this baked into

1824
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:28,559
it yeah

1825
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,778
you know but still and it's still uh

1826
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,359
yeah makes way more money than otherwise

1827
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:36,600
right and so there's an aspect now where

1828
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,298
it's like yeah biomass people are

1829
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,980
looking for like you know like weight on

1830
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:43,019
you know wet weight how much I can

1831
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:45,718
extract what's my yield what's my this

1832
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:48,000
where the previous selection process in

1833
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:52,079
cannabis was entirely consumer based

1834
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,338
yeah right almost all these fads needed

1835
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,679
a bunch of people at the other end

1836
01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:57,420
willing to buy it for top dollar yeah

1837
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,579
that's what drove the purple craze

1838
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,500
that's what drove sour that's why sour

1839
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:03,840
was the best-selling weed in America was

1840
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,460
because there was this massive Corridor

1841
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,880
on the East Coast that this couldn't get

1842
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:10,500
enough of it yeah right yeah it became

1843
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,000
part of the culture it became part of

1844
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,738
the culture you know and then cush had

1845
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,198
its whole moment in Southern California

1846
01:10:13,738 --> 01:10:18,539
and elsewhere yeah you know and then

1847
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:20,099
cookies was the bay and then you know

1848
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:21,840
and you have Skittles winning all these

1849
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,820
Awards and stuff so a lot of that stuff

1850
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,800
is I mean we used to joke when we first

1851
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:28,619
got the real Skittles where it was like

1852
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,260
you'd start edging next year's death now

1853
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:33,019
yeah I did you know because it was like

1854
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:36,360
oh let's give it a good six month veg

1855
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:38,100
and it'll be three feet tall yeah I

1856
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:39,299
remember the first time my buddy I had a

1857
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,219
I had a good friend of mine that got

1858
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,800
Skittles kind of before it was it was

1859
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:46,158
named that as much and he grew these

1860
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,140
plants he had Lake County beautiful sun

1861
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:50,698
400 gallon pots you know all organic

1862
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:53,100
really nice and he called me up all

1863
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:54,960
panicked and wanted me to come out and I

1864
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,600
was like walking this was like back in

1865
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,119
the trees era so I'm walking through he

1866
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,440
has shot diesels and green cracks and

1867
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:03,619
you know different things and they're

1868
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:07,139
all you know nine ten feet tall

1869
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:08,340
trellised out you know scat all that and

1870
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:11,219
then you walk to this section and

1871
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:14,400
there's like five Skittles and they like

1872
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:16,739
come up to like my waist yeah I bet and

1873
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:18,119
they're all wide and like little chunks

1874
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:20,459
and his buddy was like oh I'll give you

1875
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:22,260
like four times as much but you're

1876
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,760
looking at these like tiny little runts

1877
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,460
they were all started at the same time

1878
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,679
yeah and he thought he was [ __ ] up

1879
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,239
yeah he just didn't realize that it grew

1880
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:32,819
eight times as slow as anything else

1881
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:35,459
yeah

1882
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:37,319
um you know and so there's that aspect

1883
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,140
too where it was like Skittles would

1884
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:41,639
never pass any kind of production model

1885
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,880
Skittles looks like they've got a

1886
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:47,159
goddamn disease but Skittles is ugly as

1887
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,619
flower for the most part you know which

1888
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:52,319
is fine I don't mind I I am totally a

1889
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:54,779
pre-cookie person so I'm fine with ugly

1890
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,639
flour that works good yeah

1891
01:11:54,779 --> 01:12:00,179
um but you know it it's very slow

1892
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,980
growing it's a bit mold prone

1893
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:03,480
um you know uh but none of that mattered

1894
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:05,939
when it was winning a bunch of awards

1895
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:07,738
for extraction exactly because you're

1896
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:09,839
just testing the extract and the hash

1897
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:11,639
was fire and that's that was my point

1898
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,860
about the potency aspect too it's like

1899
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,960
yeah I mean like it used to be a major

1900
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:17,219
deal that if the flower wasn't potent

1901
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,960
but that's not such a deal breaker

1902
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:21,899
anymore with the extract Market thriving

1903
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,579
no I mean in fact I'll you know I was

1904
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:26,099
joking with you about Citrus and it was

1905
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:27,779
it was a little I get me saying Citrus

1906
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,000
gave you a bunch of pads because there's

1907
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:31,920
a bunch of kinds of citrus and citrus

1908
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,198
for people that don't know also tends to

1909
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,179
breed fairly dominant yes you know

1910
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:38,519
orange things a lot of time pass Orange

1911
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:39,899
grapefruit grapefruit lemon lemon that

1912
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,520
kind of thing right it's pretty dominant

1913
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:44,579
term

1914
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,219
um you know but a lot of times those

1915
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:50,519
um those Citrus cuts are pretty moderate

1916
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:53,399
to mild potency yeah there's not really

1917
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,199
a lot of ones that test very high or by

1918
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:57,658
themselves are particularly potent and

1919
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:59,879
so I almost think that like Tangie came

1920
01:12:57,658 --> 01:13:01,979
along at a perfect time because it was

1921
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,319
like a big skunk plant here I am

1922
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:07,139
shouting out DNA or whatever but it was

1923
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,639
a big Citrus skunk plant at a time when

1924
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:11,039
a lot of people had forgotten about

1925
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:14,039
Citrus because it was so unpopular

1926
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:15,359
yeah coincided right with the extraction

1927
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:19,019
movement

1928
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:21,238
and that Citrus Turf passed or at the

1929
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:24,000
time a lot of other Terps kind of ended

1930
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:27,359
up tasting like axle grease and it also

1931
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,579
was not named Cali o no most importantly

1932
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:32,039
so people were like oh that's his no

1933
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:33,359
it's not named Kelly oh and so and so I

1934
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:36,960
really I don't know if it would have

1935
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,698
caught on without that BHO era being

1936
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,340
timed right then when people were

1937
01:13:38,698 --> 01:13:43,139
getting nails and dab kit and all the

1938
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,659
different little tools and accoutrements

1939
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,980
that went along with it you know yeah

1940
01:13:45,658 --> 01:13:50,219
um and then it's like you take something

1941
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:52,859
that's like 15 THC and not that potent

1942
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:55,859
but if you extract it and it's 80 well

1943
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:57,539
now okay now we're somewhere yeah it

1944
01:13:55,859 --> 01:13:58,799
might not be a long lasting high but

1945
01:13:57,539 --> 01:14:01,439
it'll get you high

1946
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,640
I know there's something and and we can

1947
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:03,899
keep talking about this but I know

1948
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,159
there's something that people wanted you

1949
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:07,859
to cover and it's something that we

1950
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:09,960
missed last time or a few times ago and

1951
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:11,579
it was the your drawing Tech

1952
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,460
oh man

1953
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:15,840
well let me uh I'll talk about that let

1954
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,658
me just say because people are throwing

1955
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,039
in Calio so in that big hunt that we

1956
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:22,619
were doing

1957
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:25,880
um down south or whatever uh I ran a

1958
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:29,760
number of csis Calio hybrids

1959
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:33,420
and I was actually amazed at how sativa

1960
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,219
it read yeah it really it really did

1961
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:38,039
like even things that were pretty Indica

1962
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:41,340
that I thought would be would lean they

1963
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:43,319
were big tall branchy

1964
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:45,960
orange smelling

1965
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:48,658
you know yeah the grandpa weed looking

1966
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:51,060
uh phinos and stuff like that so it was

1967
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:52,500
it was a lot more in different hybrids

1968
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,260
it was a lot more sativa than I was

1969
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,960
expecting yeah right

1970
01:14:55,260 --> 01:15:00,300
I'll I'll say that and Cali o went

1971
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:03,359
through periods where it became so

1972
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:06,480
unpopular it was almost unsellable yes

1973
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,759
yes I it's the only weed well a type of

1974
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:12,539
Kaleo is the only weed someone ever

1975
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:14,760
brought back to me and said not not this

1976
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:16,560
didn't get me high yeah and there's an

1977
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,719
aspect with almost with a lot of very

1978
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,340
citrusy weed that's like that where

1979
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,079
people find the high to be some some

1980
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:25,199
people find the high to be fleeting or

1981
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:28,380
super short-lived or they just develop a

1982
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:30,779
tolerance to it after two or three days

1983
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:32,760
um you know and uh and other people are

1984
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:34,500
fine with it but there is a percentage

1985
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,960
of people that develop a tolerance and

1986
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,039
find it boring yeah and there's

1987
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,359
definitely a difference someone said

1988
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:41,640
cleaner there's definitely a difference

1989
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,859
in Citrus there are some plants that are

1990
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,719
like sweet Citrus that have almost a

1991
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:47,819
creaminess to them yeah and then there's

1992
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:50,640
ones that smell like you just sprayed

1993
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:53,759
orange cleaner in your mouth yes very

1994
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,039
astringent and orange just pissed orange

1995
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,820
or a lemon you know something like that

1996
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:01,679
just Berry like astringent and weird and

1997
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:04,198
yeah and like you've sucked on a

1998
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,779
chemical you know yeah I I hate that

1999
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:09,000
that long lingering mouth-coating lemon

2000
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:11,399
like lemon G and lemon tree I can't

2001
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,560
stand that oh you just burn out I mean

2002
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:15,719
I'm one of those people I burn out it's

2003
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,580
fine to have it in rotation

2004
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,340
but if I was stuck with it as my only

2005
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:22,198
weed for a month I would be so bummed I

2006
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,880
I get yeah I don't even put it in

2007
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:25,619
rotation I don't like the tip flavor at

2008
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,480
all and but there was a moment where

2009
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:29,340
with BHO and certain things when that

2010
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:31,859
was super popular before rosin was

2011
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:34,260
really hitting that those Citrus Terps

2012
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:35,759
came through really clean and clear a

2013
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,460
lot of people made a lot of money off

2014
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:41,100
[ __ ] lemon G in Ohio yeah lemon G and

2015
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:43,739
and the Tangy I mean Tangy sort of

2016
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,600
rocketed DNA to being super busy for

2017
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:48,119
four or five years after that

2018
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,300
cracked it yeah I mean yeah whatever

2019
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:52,859
whatever combination yeah Crockett you

2020
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,119
know so

2021
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:59,158
um as far as drying Tech man that's a uh

2022
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,779
that's a big subject but I could chat

2023
01:16:59,158 --> 01:17:05,519
about it or whatever yeah this is your

2024
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:07,559
specialty man I will say that um

2025
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,900
I will say that like you know there's a

2026
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,300
lot of people that throw a lot of stuff

2027
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:13,619
out there as far as like what's drying

2028
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,739
Tech and I think there's a lot of like

2029
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:17,939
copycat stuff out there yeah um so for

2030
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:20,939
me

2031
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:23,099
um because I've always been a smoker uh

2032
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:25,919
I was always interested in making sure

2033
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:28,079
my weed came out nice yes right and

2034
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,020
curing it you know a lot of times people

2035
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:34,079
put an enormous amount of of uh uh

2036
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,940
weight on what they feed their plant

2037
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,920
and all that and like all these

2038
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:40,079
different environmental factors and

2039
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,500
those those things can all throw in but

2040
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:46,380
if you don't cure it the right way

2041
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,600
um a lot of that gets overwhelmed yes

2042
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,460
you know and so there's an aspect where

2043
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,620
there's no point in my career rally

2044
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,779
really where I was competing on scale

2045
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:57,420
there was always way bigger people than

2046
01:17:54,779 --> 01:17:59,099
me so I always tried to make sure even

2047
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,020
if there was a flood up in my neck of

2048
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:03,480
the woods that my weed was just good

2049
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,179
enough to go yeah

2050
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,399
right like some of it's gonna move yeah

2051
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:10,619
should be mine yeah you know what I mean

2052
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,299
and so damn right and and so as a result

2053
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,260
of that you had to and then on top of

2054
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,900
that too

2055
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,760
it's like coming from like a my own

2056
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:21,238
perspective is like I never grew my head

2057
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,940
stash super separate too much so like I

2058
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,319
needed it all to be good yeah in that

2059
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:27,359
regard people are saying let's hear the

2060
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:28,799
dry Tech well there's like but it's it's

2061
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:31,738
just like the breeding Tech or whatever

2062
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:34,380
right there's like there's goals like

2063
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:35,879
what are you trying to do right and so

2064
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:37,859
one of the things I had to figure out

2065
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,319
was that and this is kind of what like

2066
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,819
separately led to caring is that there's

2067
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,559
this thing up here that we use now it's

2068
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:46,319
permanent but there's this thing we used

2069
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:48,840
to call that uh called the flood

2070
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:52,679
and the flood used to be November

2071
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,300
December January and it was it was way

2072
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:56,039
too hard to sell

2073
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,719
okay it's because you know people would

2074
01:18:56,039 --> 01:18:59,698
go on vacation people would go to see

2075
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:01,920
their families it's around the holidays

2076
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:03,719
some people like Hawaii some people are

2077
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,140
back home with Grandma and if enough

2078
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:09,179
links in those chains disappear

2079
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:11,219
people end up sitting on stuff yeah and

2080
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:13,859
then people figured out that there was a

2081
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:16,679
dry spell in Spring and so if you were

2082
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:19,198
if you were smart you would hold on to

2083
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:21,960
most of your stuff until spring when it

2084
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:24,000
would be both much easier and

2085
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:26,760
um much more higher price yeah higher

2086
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,619
price right so that was good so uh is

2087
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,020
the flood happening this year this year

2088
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:33,238
the flood is the last few years the

2089
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:35,400
flood has seemingly never stopped we are

2090
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:37,559
yeah we are living in Water World

2091
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:40,039
there's been no receding there's been no

2092
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:43,080
price spiking going on it has been

2093
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:45,479
Atlantis man this is this is yes this is

2094
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:47,880
the ice caps melting as far as pricing

2095
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:50,819
goes on the west coast so

2096
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,739
um but what happened is is that you

2097
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:54,658
ended up needing to figure out like

2098
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:58,979
people realize that if they trimmed all

2099
01:19:54,658 --> 01:20:00,238
their weed in in Fall it both cost a

2100
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:02,339
bunch of money because you had to pay

2101
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:04,019
the Tremors and then for the most part

2102
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:06,719
unless you were really careful about how

2103
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,219
you stored it your weed was worse in

2104
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,859
spring when you had to when you had to

2105
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:13,020
sell it yeah and then sometimes you were

2106
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:14,579
growing enough that like you weren't

2107
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,020
even with the size trim crew you're

2108
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:18,719
gonna have it was going to take you a

2109
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:20,699
while to even get to that weed yeah so

2110
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:24,119
you had to be able to dry and cure it

2111
01:20:20,698 --> 01:20:26,219
right in a way that it stayed nice yeah

2112
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,619
for a period of time for a variety of

2113
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:31,560
reasons yeah right and then there's an

2114
01:20:28,619 --> 01:20:33,840
aspect where you can always like if you

2115
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,480
it's basically like you get one shot to

2116
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,279
do it the right way and you can like

2117
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:39,959
adapt along the way but if you [ __ ] up

2118
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:41,579
too bad you've just ruined it for that

2119
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,920
round yeah

2120
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:46,019
so I know that's like a I haven't really

2121
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,158
said anything about the tech but there's

2122
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,679
like a

2123
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:53,639
a reasoning behind it of how you get

2124
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:54,899
there right so uh and for people that

2125
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,219
aren't Growers that are listening I'm

2126
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:57,599
sorry if you're bored or whatever but

2127
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:59,460
because it's about to get a little

2128
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,380
specific but

2129
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:04,560
um basically what I what the way I look

2130
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:06,420
at it is that when you're drawing weed

2131
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,039
I like to either cut the plant down

2132
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:11,819
whole

2133
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:15,899
um or chop it into chunks yeah okay

2134
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:17,219
relatively relatively big chunks okay

2135
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:19,920
um someone just said it'll teach me your

2136
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:21,899
ways on an eight by four so

2137
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,300
um if you're worried about temps or

2138
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:26,399
you're worried about water loss or

2139
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,020
you're a little extra dry you can leave

2140
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:30,299
it in bigger pieces

2141
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,440
yeah because those pieces will hold more

2142
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,179
moisture because there's a lot of

2143
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,859
moisture in the stem if you have really

2144
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:36,658
good control over your environment you

2145
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:39,479
can chop them into smaller mid-sized

2146
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:41,279
pieces and hang them that way

2147
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:43,619
um and I just hang them up

2148
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:46,380
um people can you can use hangers you

2149
01:21:43,619 --> 01:21:48,059
can use netting uh you can use you know

2150
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:50,460
just a variety of things that allows you

2151
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:54,239
to click create lines or walls

2152
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:57,119
is basically how it boils down to and

2153
01:21:54,238 --> 01:22:00,299
um I leave all the water leaf on

2154
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:02,579
yeah 100 I don't take off any water leak

2155
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:05,460
and the reason for that is that the

2156
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:07,260
things that [ __ ] up your buds are

2157
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,239
um are uh

2158
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:12,360
basically air

2159
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:14,099
heat and light yeah right those are the

2160
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:17,519
things that start to oxidize your weed

2161
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:19,980
and start to mess it up okay so what all

2162
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,560
that families do is that they fold down

2163
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:24,779
over the flower and they essentially

2164
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,580
like if you have fans for air movement

2165
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:29,099
and stuff like that they're generally

2166
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:31,198
blowing on the fan leaves not on

2167
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:34,500
directly on your flower yeah and it's

2168
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:36,059
making your flower darker yeah right so

2169
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,399
it's protecting it from wind it's

2170
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,840
protecting it from from light it's

2171
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,238
protecting it from the various things

2172
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,179
that might degrade it and

2173
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:47,339
as your plant starts to dry it'll suck

2174
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:49,679
that moisture from all those from all

2175
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,880
those leaves into itself yes and that's

2176
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,619
kind of what you're trying to do is

2177
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,520
you're trying to get you're trying to

2178
01:22:52,619 --> 01:22:55,380
get

2179
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,920
um how do you put it you're trying to

2180
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,719
slowly sweat out enough moisture gotten

2181
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,760
enough chlorophyll right so you want

2182
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,520
this to be a slow process so you want it

2183
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,699
to be a slow process so I see all kinds

2184
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:11,520
of things where people talk about 60 60

2185
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:14,879
you know 60 degrees and 60 humidity for

2186
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,960
two weeks uh I do disagree on that a

2187
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,020
little bit

2188
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,760
um I think the 60 humidity is fine

2189
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:23,219
um but I think that that's actually like

2190
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,920
a little too cold yeah you know and it

2191
01:23:23,219 --> 01:23:28,679
really slows down uh transpiration at

2192
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:32,520
times I like it I think the 60s is fine

2193
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:34,260
I like I like uh you know mid 60s and

2194
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,300
anywhere really realistically speaking

2195
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,300
from mid 60s to low 70s you're pretty

2196
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,920
safe yeah you know in my opinion like

2197
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,880
there's ideal and then there's like what

2198
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,399
you're going to deal with and then

2199
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:48,119
there's an aspect of like

2200
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:50,519
um there's a there's an aspect of uh

2201
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:53,340
when you're hanging it the first three

2202
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:55,980
or four days a whole bunch of water is

2203
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:57,659
going to flow out of those plants yeah

2204
01:23:55,979 --> 01:24:00,059
so depending on how much weed you have

2205
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:01,679
and how much space it is like it doesn't

2206
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:03,300
really matter if you have a stuffed four

2207
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,219
by eight or you have a stuffed big

2208
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:07,500
garage or you have a stuffed Warehouse

2209
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:08,880
or whatever whatever size it is if it's

2210
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,619
stuffed

2211
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,199
um you know it can be really hard to

2212
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:16,079
have enough dehumidification yeah in

2213
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:18,479
order to pull that much water out of it

2214
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,939
so a lot of people lose control or

2215
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:22,619
whatever like the and you know a lot of

2216
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:24,899
D homes don't even like to work at 60

2217
01:24:22,619 --> 01:24:26,519
degrees either yeah so having them a bit

2218
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:28,319
warmer really helps but that's one thing

2219
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,239
people should all look at is that

2220
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,460
there's a bunch of dehumidifiers if you

2221
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:34,559
don't have a low-grain refrigerant d-hum

2222
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:37,679
you probably don't have a d-hum that's

2223
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,940
suitable for drying yeah and most d-hums

2224
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,859
are rated for a certain temperature

2225
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:42,839
which is quite warm and a certain

2226
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:43,979
humidity which is quite high and you

2227
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,860
should look at like where their

2228
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:49,678
operating temperature is right so if the

2229
01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:53,399
D hum says it's stopped operating at 58

2230
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:55,380
degrees yeah don't run your room at 60.

2231
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:57,000
yeah it's too close to it just not

2232
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,560
working you should probably run it at 70

2233
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,560
and give your D home a chance to work

2234
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,659
right yeah so but if you have a low

2235
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,940
grain refrigerant d-hum

2236
01:25:03,658 --> 01:25:07,439
um it'll work at those temps so there's

2237
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:08,759
basically a mode where it's like you're

2238
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,919
just trying to make sure your weed

2239
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,600
doesn't mold and you get that humidity

2240
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:14,279
you're trying to keep it cool and you're

2241
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,860
trying to get that humidity out of there

2242
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:18,658
yeah some people vent you know some

2243
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:20,399
people literally exhaust air and bring

2244
01:25:18,658 --> 01:25:22,259
in fresh air because that's like if the

2245
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,119
temperatures and outside are fine or

2246
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:25,860
whatever that's great yeah um some

2247
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,198
people try to do a combination of air

2248
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:30,179
conditioners and de-hums but you're

2249
01:25:28,198 --> 01:25:33,139
basically trying to keep it somewhere

2250
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:36,239
between the mid 60s to low 70s and temp

2251
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:39,179
and you know somewhere between ideally

2252
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,698
60 humidity but don't panic if it's 65

2253
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:44,699
or 70 or even 75 four or five for the

2254
01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:46,979
first day or two it should come down but

2255
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:49,619
if it doesn't that first day there's so

2256
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:51,119
much moisture yeah and depending on how

2257
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:53,399
much vegetative material in a small

2258
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,800
space it could be insane like you were

2259
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,238
saying yeah I mean it's it's people are

2260
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,260
talking about dipping it hydrogen

2261
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:03,000
peroxide ah you just if uh don't do that

2262
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:05,940
um people are doing that because they're

2263
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,800
trying to pass testing with various PM

2264
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:12,059
or Biologicals or different stuff like

2265
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:15,980
that hydrogen peroxide is um uh is a uh

2266
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:15,980
it oxidizes so

2267
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,840
various Terps it's going to oxidize

2268
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:23,400
various compounds it's going to it's

2269
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,380
going to lower the quality of your weed

2270
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:28,198
you know yeah

2271
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:29,639
um so so there's an aspect of and look I

2272
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:31,198
mean these are just like people can hit

2273
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:32,880
me up later these are just like basic

2274
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,738
things it's actually kind of hard to

2275
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,079
just walk through like all the little

2276
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:38,339
details of how you would do it yeah but

2277
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:40,019
essentially I'm just trying to give you

2278
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:42,179
like a range whatever your equipment

2279
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:43,800
might be some people might be able to

2280
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:46,319
use outside air some people might be

2281
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,480
able to use dehumidifiers and air

2282
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,219
conditioners maybe even dehumidifiers

2283
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:52,198
and heaters depending on where they live

2284
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:53,520
and what time of year it is but you're

2285
01:26:52,198 --> 01:26:56,819
just trying to keep the plant in that

2286
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:59,520
range and after three or four days your

2287
01:26:56,819 --> 01:27:02,340
plant's gonna shrink a bunch yeah right

2288
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,960
and once it shrinks a bunch then you're

2289
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:06,659
in a mode where you're going to start to

2290
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:09,359
see most of that water is gone and it

2291
01:27:06,658 --> 01:27:12,359
should be a lot easier for you to

2292
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:14,099
moderate your drying room yeah right

2293
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:15,719
like as long as as long as you have the

2294
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,639
equipment in place that's going to make

2295
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:20,760
it work right you're not really battling

2296
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:22,020
in that middle section yeah right so

2297
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,179
you're just trying to keep it at those

2298
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:26,219
same temps and now another three or four

2299
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:27,658
days passes right

2300
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:29,579
and

2301
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:31,198
now you're in the third stage stage of

2302
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:33,359
drawing which is actually kind of weird

2303
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:34,279
because you risk your plants getting too

2304
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:36,779
dry

2305
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:39,300
but if you take them down often after

2306
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:41,099
six or seven days there's still got too

2307
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,900
much moisture in the stem and you try to

2308
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:45,300
bin them up or bag them up and that

2309
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:48,719
sweats right out yeah it's a lot more

2310
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:51,179
work yeah right so I like to go 10 or 14

2311
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,920
days on the line yeah if I'm doing it

2312
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:54,420
commercially it's usually 10 or 12 of

2313
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,539
them doing it for myself it's usually

2314
01:27:54,420 --> 01:28:00,119
more like 14. you know but you might

2315
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:03,119
actually have I have humidifiers

2316
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:05,639
yeah where sometimes I add moisture bad

2317
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,139
back into my room yeah sometimes it

2318
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:08,639
might be fall and it might have not

2319
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:11,819
rained in months and it might be bone

2320
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:13,920
dry and 20 humidity outside and your AC

2321
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:15,599
is removing some moisture and so is your

2322
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,539
whatever sometimes you turn off all your

2323
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,520
D humps yeah right sometimes you turn

2324
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:21,899
off your fans

2325
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,719
um and because you're just trying to

2326
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:25,859
conserve that moisture sometimes and

2327
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,260
you're just trying to get through that

2328
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:30,658
next three or four days to let the

2329
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:33,900
chlorophyll on the moisture slowly sweat

2330
01:28:30,658 --> 01:28:35,519
out yeah and if it's too dry your stuff

2331
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:37,859
will start to get crisp

2332
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,360
yeah right so you're going low and slow

2333
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:41,339
some people just want to say just leave

2334
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:43,380
it at 60 and 60 like the jungle boys or

2335
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:44,699
some [ __ ] and you just like Let It Be I

2336
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:46,920
don't actually I think that there's like

2337
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:48,359
three distinct stages and if you treat

2338
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,179
them different it's a little easier to

2339
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:53,579
deal with well 60 60 can't work for all

2340
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:55,500
types of Bud densities either like I

2341
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:57,238
mean you've got to be some range there's

2342
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:59,100
a lot of CopyCat stuff in there so I'm

2343
01:28:57,238 --> 01:29:00,718
just kind of trying to give generals and

2344
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:03,239
maybe I'm talking fast because it's kind

2345
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,679
of a big subject or whatever but and if

2346
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:06,479
you have if you have the right

2347
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:07,920
environment

2348
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,559
um if you have the right environment

2349
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,079
like you can actually you could you can

2350
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,940
keep it three weeks four weeks you know

2351
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:16,920
it's not like yeah you know you can

2352
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:18,960
actually I mean with the right outside

2353
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:21,060
and the right inside you can leave it up

2354
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,800
there for a while if you wanted to I

2355
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:25,139
don't tend to like to because I often

2356
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,060
have to refill it or I just find that

2357
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:29,400
the next stage I can actually get a lot

2358
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:32,340
more control doing it what I do next so

2359
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:34,319
this is where a lot of people [ __ ] it up

2360
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,460
in my opinion right here right I don't

2361
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:37,439
think I've like talked about anything

2362
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,698
too revolutionary yet or any [ __ ] like

2363
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:41,339
no no

2364
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:43,379
um but here's where it's a mess is that

2365
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:46,860
there's an aspect where

2366
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:48,600
after 10 or 11 days like people tend to

2367
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:50,819
think that they need to store their weed

2368
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,780
at a consistency that's perfect for

2369
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:53,819
smoke

2370
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:54,960
yeah and you actually probably don't

2371
01:29:53,819 --> 01:29:56,639
want to store it at that you probably

2372
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,000
want to store it like a little bit too

2373
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:03,359
moist yeah for smoke right and so what

2374
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,520
you what I end up doing is at that point

2375
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,738
like I think that's where the Cure

2376
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,800
begins right and a lot of people think

2377
01:30:07,738 --> 01:30:11,819
you cure in jars you actually cure on

2378
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,279
the stem

2379
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:15,658
okay if you take it off the stem you're

2380
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:19,738
not curing

2381
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:21,420
okay why is that because most curing and

2382
01:30:19,738 --> 01:30:22,738
like if you talk to Tobacco farmer

2383
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,600
people or whatever like they'll talk

2384
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:26,218
about this all day or you know all the

2385
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,620
growth tobacco for cigars or different

2386
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:31,560
things there's an interplay between the

2387
01:30:28,619 --> 01:30:32,340
stem and the leaf yeah the stem and the

2388
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,500
flower

2389
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,960
right and the plant can if as long as

2390
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:40,319
it's all connected the plant can move

2391
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:44,100
that moisture around itself yeah right

2392
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:46,500
so what I tend to do is that when it

2393
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:49,620
comes time I will take like a bunch of

2394
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:52,500
like uh literally like a store like

2395
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:54,359
grocery style paperbacks yeah and you

2396
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,158
open it up and at that point

2397
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:58,439
you got to feel when you're about to

2398
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,979
seal something up you got to think like

2399
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:03,178
you know how like osmosis and like like

2400
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:05,879
Aromas and moisture and all that will

2401
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:08,039
try to equalize yeah so at that point

2402
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,600
I've got a bunch of fan leaves and this

2403
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:12,060
somebody was mentioning earlier when you

2404
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,860
do it that way bucking is a [ __ ] it is

2405
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,719
when you Buck

2406
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:18,119
um before I put my stuff in there I take

2407
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:20,279
most of the No No Sweet Leaf but I take

2408
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:22,979
most of the big leaf off

2409
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:25,979
yeah and then I chop it into chunks that

2410
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:27,539
fit into like the I'm not holding my

2411
01:31:25,979 --> 01:31:29,158
hands open the right way but I chop it

2412
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:31,619
into chunks that fit into the paper bag

2413
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:33,238
yeah you know so think about how long a

2414
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:35,698
paper bag is and they're about that size

2415
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:37,859
yeah and then you start stacking it with

2416
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:40,319
things that have Mo not all but most of

2417
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:42,238
the fan Leaf removed and left on the

2418
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:45,479
stem but chopped into chunks that fit

2419
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:47,459
yeah and then that that bin can you that

2420
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:51,839
that paper bag can usually hold between

2421
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:55,260
I don't know 400 and 600 700 grams okay

2422
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,300
okay so then you fold it over

2423
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,980
right and you put it into a contractor

2424
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:01,679
bag

2425
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:04,138
now this might not sound too crazy but

2426
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,119
what it does is that you then fill that

2427
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:08,219
contractor bag with say depending on how

2428
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:09,599
tall the contractor is like six or nine

2429
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:13,020
backs

2430
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,520
okay okay and so here's here's where a

2431
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:17,880
bunch of people [ __ ] it up in my opinion

2432
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,920
right is that it is most people when

2433
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:23,159
they take it down off the line they just

2434
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:25,859
throw it as is into a into a plastic bin

2435
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:27,719
yeah build the bin shut the bin that's a

2436
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:29,880
super common way right well the reason

2437
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:31,739
why I don't like that is because what

2438
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,779
happens is you have all that extra stem

2439
01:32:31,738 --> 01:32:38,459
and you have all that extra fan Leaf

2440
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:41,639
right yeah and that [ __ ] smells like hay

2441
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:43,679
yeah it really does that's the stuff

2442
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:46,020
that smells like chlorophyll that's the

2443
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,520
stuff that smells green that's the stuff

2444
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,139
that has all the Aromas that you don't

2445
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,239
want and when you put

2446
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:53,520
a bunch of weed or anything into a

2447
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:56,339
sealed container a lot of times all that

2448
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,320
Aroma tries to equalize itself yeah so

2449
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:01,139
you're gonna send that Aroma all the way

2450
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:04,619
through your week yeah right so by

2451
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:06,719
picking off most of the big families and

2452
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:08,519
then by chopping the excess stem off and

2453
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,679
just leaving it on stem chunks that are

2454
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,840
big enough to fit in the bag you remove

2455
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:14,760
most of that and so the vast majority of

2456
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:17,880
what's in that paper bag

2457
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:20,219
is either Sweet Leaf or flour yeah with

2458
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,739
some Associated stem right

2459
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:24,119
and then you fill that thing up and you

2460
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:26,218
turn it over and you put it in there

2461
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:28,500
okay so here's where it's also different

2462
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:31,439
than bintech

2463
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:33,719
yeah right in a bin most people use like

2464
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,479
the black and yellow totes right yeah

2465
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:39,060
they're like 25 or 30 gallons okay yeah

2466
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:40,678
so you fill one of those up and you put

2467
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:41,940
a lid on and there's nowhere for it to

2468
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:44,399
breathe

2469
01:33:41,939 --> 01:33:47,039
and it's two feet of cannabis weighing

2470
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:50,039
down on the bottom yeah so what is that

2471
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:52,560
bot what is that bottom third like

2472
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:54,119
it's got weight pushing down it's going

2473
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,600
to be moisture pushing down on it

2474
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:59,698
there's nowhere for it to breathe right

2475
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:02,579
so if you put like six or nine paper

2476
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:03,960
bags into a contractor

2477
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:04,559
go ahead

2478
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:08,698
um

2479
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,739
they uh they stop they hold their shape

2480
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:12,539
yep right

2481
01:34:10,738 --> 01:34:15,718
they hold their shape

2482
01:34:12,539 --> 01:34:18,539
so you never have a few thousand grams

2483
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:20,579
weighing down on the bottom yeah there

2484
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:22,859
is there you know what I'm saying yeah

2485
01:34:20,579 --> 01:34:25,979
you know because they stack and that

2486
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:27,179
paper holds its shape and the paper Okay

2487
01:34:25,979 --> 01:34:31,019
um

2488
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:34,800
the paper actually is porous

2489
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:36,600
yes it's not like a bin so instead of a

2490
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,840
bin where you have two or three or four

2491
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,760
pounds you know of of weeds stuffed into

2492
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,400
a bin and then sealed and there's no

2493
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:47,460
breathability yeah all those bags get to

2494
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:49,379
breathe yeah and that breathing is what

2495
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:50,760
brings the moisture slowly from the

2496
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:55,020
center to the outside

2497
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:58,920
okay right so then you can you can put

2498
01:34:55,020 --> 01:35:00,480
it in there right and and you can tie it

2499
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:03,119
off and if you did it just the right way

2500
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:07,500
it'll stay stable like that for straight

2501
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:09,539
up weeks to months oh yeah 100 okay and

2502
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:11,698
I've done I've done like experiments

2503
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:14,399
with friends or whatever where like you

2504
01:35:11,698 --> 01:35:16,439
know you trim some up within a few weeks

2505
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,719
yeah and two months later you go back

2506
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:21,000
and all the stuff that was still in the

2507
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,980
paper bags has a bunch of Terps

2508
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,439
yeah where where the stuff that got

2509
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:28,198
trimmed it started to oxidize

2510
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:30,419
right and so there's an aspect there

2511
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:32,099
where the reason why we came to this is

2512
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,219
that for one you don't end up with a

2513
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:37,620
million bins that reek that you have to

2514
01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:39,960
sterilize and clean all the time you end

2515
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:42,238
up with like super light contractor bags

2516
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,219
and paper bags yeah and let's say you

2517
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:45,779
seal up the contractor bag and it like

2518
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:47,100
you open it up and you [ __ ] up and you

2519
01:35:45,779 --> 01:35:50,039
were a little too fast and it's a little

2520
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:52,199
too moist right you can then just open

2521
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:55,500
and leave the contractor bag open

2522
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:57,539
yeah right then if it's if you really

2523
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:59,399
[ __ ] up you might have to take those

2524
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:02,039
bags out of the contractor

2525
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:03,599
yeah but then they all breathe yeah so

2526
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:05,460
you can open them up

2527
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,020
right and then if you really messed up

2528
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:09,119
and you were too aggressive about it and

2529
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,340
you feel down there and it feels wet and

2530
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:15,119
damp and uncomfortable right yeah you

2531
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:16,800
can actually take an empty paper bag and

2532
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:19,920
your full one and you can dump it in

2533
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,800
there and now the bottom is the top yeah

2534
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:25,319
right you just fluffed it essentially

2535
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,719
and you can do that one by one to all of

2536
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:29,279
them that's only if you screw up and you

2537
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:31,020
realize that after you've sealed it up

2538
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,579
for a day it's not as stable as you want

2539
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,679
it to be there was too much moisture in

2540
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:36,059
there and it actually got re-wet yeah

2541
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:37,560
when you get it to the moisture level

2542
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:39,659
you want you can seal it back up and you

2543
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,639
can put it in there and

2544
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:44,219
you know I've had a situation where like

2545
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:46,739
a lot of times in outdoor season in the

2546
01:36:44,219 --> 01:36:48,480
fall it took us quite a while to get

2547
01:36:46,738 --> 01:36:50,879
through all the work

2548
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,979
yeah so you had to store it in such a

2549
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,779
way that you could

2550
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:56,698
um you know you you would you would keep

2551
01:36:54,779 --> 01:36:59,939
the quality

2552
01:36:56,698 --> 01:37:01,559
yeah and that definitely uh made it all

2553
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:03,839
the way to our parties and [ __ ] because

2554
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:06,060
I remember smoking that you know after

2555
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,639
effect and it was still just amazing oh

2556
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:10,800
that first year especially yeah pip and

2557
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,840
myself and and home you know the friends

2558
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,940
like we went and all that weed in those

2559
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:17,219
in those bags and jars we pulled out of

2560
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:18,719
that's why most of it was untrimmed you

2561
01:37:17,219 --> 01:37:20,579
know or partially trimmed we just pulled

2562
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,960
it out of the bags just like that Tech

2563
01:37:20,579 --> 01:37:24,300
and it had been sitting in there for two

2564
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:26,698
months yeah and most of our close

2565
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:28,440
friends to be perfectly honest uh in

2566
01:37:26,698 --> 01:37:29,759
Even in our Circle and our Discord and

2567
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:32,579
stuff like that that have tried this

2568
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,199
method keep using it there's ways you

2569
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:36,359
can refine it I kind of skimmed over

2570
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:37,919
certain parts but because there's depth

2571
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:41,759
and there's things that can come up but

2572
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:44,100
as far as like a modular small the large

2573
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,380
scale way right

2574
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:48,719
um a lot of times people they talk about

2575
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:51,000
curing and turkey bags or curing in the

2576
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:53,819
jar you're actually not really curing

2577
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,560
your fermenting yes yeah you're

2578
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:59,340
exchanging gas when people talk about

2579
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:02,280
burping that's not actually curing

2580
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:04,020
you know what makes it fermenting as

2581
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:06,479
opposed to curing

2582
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,040
there's this one I mean it's like I

2583
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,479
don't wanna I don't want to misspeak and

2584
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:12,539
have somebody jump in that knows more

2585
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:14,459
than me about it but but in general what

2586
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:16,319
it boils down to is there's some acts

2587
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:19,020
there's some interplay

2588
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:21,479
between each of the flowers being

2589
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:23,400
connected to the stem

2590
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:25,319
yeah that doesn't mean you can't put it

2591
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:28,198
in a jar and it improves over the first

2592
01:38:25,319 --> 01:38:30,119
few weeks in the jar too I'm just saying

2593
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:32,039
that like a lot of times people think

2594
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:34,800
they remove it from all they removed it

2595
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:37,679
from the stem way too fast yeah and like

2596
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,320
if you let that that few weeks I I would

2597
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,940
even tell people like once you put it in

2598
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:44,219
that contractor just leave it alone for

2599
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:46,500
a week yeah leave it alone for 10 days

2600
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:48,539
and then go back to it and then trim it

2601
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,760
and we've had we've had a bunch of

2602
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:53,100
friends that have tried it right and

2603
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,539
they all keep using it yeah and they all

2604
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,300
feel like it improved their personal

2605
01:38:54,539 --> 01:38:59,639
smoke yeah yeah

2606
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:01,679
right that's why I wanted you to tell it

2607
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:04,260
it's important so so yeah there's an

2608
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:06,000
aspect and there's there's there's parts

2609
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,500
of it where you know like like I said I

2610
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,119
glossed over certain things because it's

2611
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,920
kind of long and involved and you could

2612
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:13,139
ask a bunch of detailed questions and

2613
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:16,980
stuff that went on and I wasn't trying

2614
01:39:13,139 --> 01:39:18,420
to like drown people and uh but anybody

2615
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:20,459
can reach out about it because I want

2616
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,920
people to have better weed and there it

2617
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:25,920
is true low and slow but I definitely

2618
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:28,619
think there's drying and there's curing

2619
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:31,440
and then there's jarring and a lot of

2620
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:34,319
people just dry and jar

2621
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:36,178
yeah and they miss that middle part

2622
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:37,679
yep that doesn't mean your weed's not

2623
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:40,980
good I'm not dissing your weed I'm just

2624
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:42,840
saying that like I've found you know for

2625
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:45,658
a lot of the things that I grow that I

2626
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:47,819
get better flavor profiles when you give

2627
01:39:45,658 --> 01:39:50,460
that plant a week or 10 days or two

2628
01:39:47,819 --> 01:39:52,380
weeks to interplay between the stem and

2629
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,698
the flower and back and forth and all

2630
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:59,039
that and cure in a big pile into itself

2631
01:39:55,698 --> 01:40:01,678
yeah you know because back in the day

2632
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:03,658
when things moved really fast

2633
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,760
um a lot of times people would I just

2634
01:40:03,658 --> 01:40:07,738
smoke some in New York people would uh

2635
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,960
they would just dry weed as fast as they

2636
01:40:07,738 --> 01:40:11,279
could get it to Market yep and it would

2637
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,560
have a little bit of that chlorophyll

2638
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:15,300
Tang I had somebody try to tell me it

2639
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:16,920
was like they they only smoke it like

2640
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,480
that because after two weeks the live

2641
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:22,020
terpenes fade

2642
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:23,579
oh okay yeah and I was like yeah I've

2643
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:25,679
smoked plenty of weed that was dried

2644
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:28,198
fast for commercial purposes I get it

2645
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:31,260
you know like yeah yeah

2646
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:32,698
you know and so yeah people can be you

2647
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:35,100
know they're yeah most people skip

2648
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:37,678
curing they go from right from drying

2649
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,960
you know right from drying to jarring

2650
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:43,020
right from jarring right from drying to

2651
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,760
packaging you know yeah and uh and this

2652
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,320
Tech it's like it's really easy it's all

2653
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,000
that stuff is really available it's

2654
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:50,340
nothing special it doesn't take up a ton

2655
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,219
of space in your house you can condense

2656
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:54,900
you can reuse the the paper bags

2657
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:57,000
multiple times if you treat them right

2658
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:58,920
you know you can shove a ton of them

2659
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,479
into one or two contractors it's light

2660
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,719
as a feather

2661
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:06,119
you know it's modular it's easy it can

2662
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:08,460
fit in a closet it can fit in a garage

2663
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:11,099
it can they can stack on top of each

2664
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:13,139
other because and and there's one thing

2665
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,579
like and you pointed out sometimes you

2666
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:16,199
might need to fluff it but it's okay

2667
01:41:14,579 --> 01:41:18,600
because not so it's a professional

2668
01:41:16,198 --> 01:41:21,000
fluffer

2669
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:23,219
yeah indeed I've been trying to get that

2670
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,899
joke in for like five minutes

2671
01:41:23,219 --> 01:41:26,639
sometimes you need to go sometimes you

2672
01:41:24,899 --> 01:41:29,039
need to make you know from bottom to top

2673
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,179
you need to really just change up what's

2674
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:31,439
going on

2675
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:32,760
um and you know that's the thing is it's

2676
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:34,319
like when you do it perfect you don't

2677
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:36,780
have to do any of that I just wanted to

2678
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:38,279
go through like because it is weird and

2679
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:39,779
we have close friends of ours that when

2680
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:41,639
we first when I first showed them how to

2681
01:41:39,779 --> 01:41:44,340
do it they thought they were putting it

2682
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:46,139
away too wet yeah and a lot of times

2683
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:47,880
they don't realize that it stores really

2684
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:49,380
well like that

2685
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:51,659
um but then sometimes it does get too

2686
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:53,279
wet like it gets a little mushy or it's

2687
01:41:51,658 --> 01:41:55,319
scary wet or whatever and you need to

2688
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:58,259
let it breathe and so there's a variety

2689
01:41:55,319 --> 01:42:00,599
of ways you can let it breathe and

2690
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:02,159
um you know this is like I just don't I

2691
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,739
don't like plastic bins for a lot they

2692
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:07,138
don't breathe at all and so what happens

2693
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:10,019
what happens in anaerobic environments

2694
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:12,719
yeah yeah it just creates stale air and

2695
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:14,460
and moisture hanging and different kinds

2696
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,920
of different kinds of processes happen

2697
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:18,658
in low oxygen versus higher oxygen

2698
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,760
environments yeah yeah

2699
01:42:18,658 --> 01:42:22,198
you know and so there's an act there's

2700
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,179
an aspect of that where it's like so

2701
01:42:22,198 --> 01:42:25,678
even if you screw up a few times there's

2702
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:28,020
like various ways you can get out of

2703
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,460
panic mode yeah sometimes all I had to

2704
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,500
do was just open the top of my

2705
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:33,960
contractor and leave it in the living

2706
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:36,300
room for you know a night or half a day

2707
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:38,880
and all of a sudden the excess moisture

2708
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:41,219
had breathed and escaped you know those

2709
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,199
paper bags are dry so like they will

2710
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:45,719
absorb a little bit of excess moisture

2711
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:49,678
without becoming damp you know so that

2712
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:52,079
helps too uh and uh you know there's

2713
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,460
there's just it just keeps the weight

2714
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:55,019
because that's what you don't want is

2715
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:59,158
you don't want

2716
01:42:55,020 --> 01:43:00,540
pressure and low oxygen and you know you

2717
01:42:59,158 --> 01:43:03,000
want things to be able to breathe you

2718
01:43:00,539 --> 01:43:05,519
want things to be able to like slowly

2719
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,198
take that last bit of moisture out from

2720
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,699
the center of the buds and from the

2721
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,979
center of the stems and bring it out

2722
01:43:08,698 --> 01:43:12,960
into the flower yeah and I think you

2723
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:15,779
know your your weed Burns better

2724
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,100
you know yeah your weed Burns better it

2725
01:43:15,779 --> 01:43:19,920
tastes better I've grown a lot of

2726
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:22,320
strains over a long period of time and I

2727
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,359
have a lot of repeats and so you know

2728
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:26,460
you you grow it one way for a while and

2729
01:43:24,359 --> 01:43:28,259
you're like oh I killed it and you grow

2730
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:29,639
this other way and you you don't get the

2731
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:31,380
trim you don't get the dry right and

2732
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:33,179
then you're like oh I [ __ ] it up yeah

2733
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:35,159
now it's not as good now my weed that's

2734
01:43:33,179 --> 01:43:36,600
like three months old still Burns a

2735
01:43:35,158 --> 01:43:39,118
little nicer than this weed that I just

2736
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,440
got fresh yeah and so you you know and

2737
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:42,779
then your friends do that too and then

2738
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:45,000
you have feedback loops and then you

2739
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:46,319
know and then you you go through and so

2740
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,539
there's a lot of things people can get

2741
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:50,340
all Tech and you can go to like moisture

2742
01:43:48,539 --> 01:43:52,979
in the buds and higher meters I'm giving

2743
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:55,139
you like Hill Tech I'm getting like

2744
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:57,479
observational Tech that's basically by

2745
01:43:55,139 --> 01:44:00,060
experience and by feel and then you have

2746
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:02,579
some Basic Ground rules on when not to

2747
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:04,020
panic about it yeah right

2748
01:44:02,579 --> 01:44:05,399
um and you know we have a buddy too that

2749
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:08,100
like is people were talking about

2750
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:10,259
elevation earlier as well I mean we have

2751
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:12,060
a we have a good friend of ours that um

2752
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:15,840
we worked through it

2753
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:18,780
um and he lives in very high elevation

2754
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,480
um and his weed dried way too fast yeah

2755
01:44:18,779 --> 01:44:23,819
yeah way way too fast and we were able

2756
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:26,158
to really slow it down and get cures and

2757
01:44:23,819 --> 01:44:28,079
he's ecstatic good

2758
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,759
yeah I remember so I'm not saying it's

2759
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:30,960
like this is like the be-all end-all I'm

2760
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,340
just saying that it's worked for me and

2761
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,920
my friends for a long period of time

2762
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,360
it's an excellent way to cure we we I

2763
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:38,579
did bring a bunch of weed to the can

2764
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:39,839
Illuminati parties dried because the

2765
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:42,420
canned Illuminati parties were in

2766
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:44,400
December yeah most of that weed came

2767
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:46,980
down in October or November so it was

2768
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:49,920
one to two months old yeah by the time

2769
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:51,419
that you guys got a hold of it yeah and

2770
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,039
it was all the weed that I brought

2771
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:54,658
whether it was trimmed or untrimmed all

2772
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,760
went through that whole process

2773
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:58,439
yeah and I really do think it brings out

2774
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:00,480
quality it's definitely a way to like

2775
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:02,279
not screw it up at the end

2776
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:03,899
wait yeah like as far as far as our

2777
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:07,319
group goes like it seems like everybody

2778
01:45:03,899 --> 01:45:09,299
kind of contributes one more some more

2779
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:11,099
than one but everybody kind of brings

2780
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:12,900
one major thing to the table and when I

2781
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:14,219
think of not so his drying Tech is the

2782
01:45:12,899 --> 01:45:16,138
one thing I think he's brought to the

2783
01:45:14,219 --> 01:45:18,779
table that's changed it for our group as

2784
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:20,340
a whole so that's why I wanted uh to

2785
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:22,618
bring it up because this is a lot of

2786
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,779
skilled uh people in our group and and

2787
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:26,099
if if it's if it's changing their minds

2788
01:45:24,779 --> 01:45:28,439
it might be something that other people

2789
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:30,300
are into too yeah and there's and you

2790
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:31,678
know there's there's there's patterns to

2791
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:34,679
it or whatever and there's ways you can

2792
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,940
adapt it here and there and so there's I

2793
01:45:34,679 --> 01:45:38,219
don't know I just I've just found it to

2794
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:39,658
be really flexible and I haven't found

2795
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:42,000
anything that gives me better quality

2796
01:45:39,658 --> 01:45:43,500
weed it's not done at all on the

2797
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,600
commercial market and I think the

2798
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:48,779
commercial Market suffers for it

2799
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:51,539
you know uh the the whole curing aspect

2800
01:45:48,779 --> 01:45:53,519
and the whole treating it nice for a bit

2801
01:45:51,539 --> 01:45:54,719
um that seems to be you know shoved away

2802
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,699
to efficiency

2803
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,560
yeah and then if you the problem is if

2804
01:45:56,698 --> 01:46:00,359
you mess it up you can always rehydrate

2805
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,580
weed but it's never the same as if you

2806
01:46:00,359 --> 01:46:04,439
dried it low and slow and got it sticky

2807
01:46:02,579 --> 01:46:07,079
if you you can get it a certain

2808
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:08,759
stickiness and a certain ratio

2809
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:10,979
um it can stay good like that for a

2810
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:12,900
really long time and if you get it

2811
01:46:10,979 --> 01:46:15,238
overly dry which a lot of people used to

2812
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:18,359
do and then they'd re-moisten for sale

2813
01:46:15,238 --> 01:46:20,879
it'll be all right for a week or two but

2814
01:46:18,359 --> 01:46:24,599
not that long no and then it'll go back

2815
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:26,219
to being a a lot a lot blander yeah you

2816
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:29,219
know so if you do it the right way you

2817
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:31,739
can get like a a weird sponginess

2818
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:34,319
that has enough give to have some

2819
01:46:31,738 --> 01:46:36,959
moisture in it and but enough you know

2820
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:39,479
but it but it's it's really well cured

2821
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,819
yeah and and not so much that it just

2822
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:43,919
goes poof in your hand yeah if you hear

2823
01:46:41,819 --> 01:46:45,059
crunching that's not that great you

2824
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,039
don't want to hear a crunch you want to

2825
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:48,900
go you know I mean the the you know

2826
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:51,539
it'll probably still get you high

2827
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:54,420
but a lot of delicate a lot of delicate

2828
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:56,279
terpenes orange peels in the sack all

2829
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:58,020
that [ __ ] that's all failure

2830
01:46:56,279 --> 01:47:00,300
yeah I mean I'm not saying it doesn't

2831
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,100
work don't get me wrong but I'm saying

2832
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:04,560
like your weed is never as good if you

2833
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:06,659
have to rehydrate it yeah if you have to

2834
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,500
rehydrate it you didn't store it the

2835
01:47:06,658 --> 01:47:10,259
right way

2836
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:11,760
yeah you know

2837
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,619
um you know yeah people saying this

2838
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,840
didn't it didn't work at scale on his 30

2839
01:47:13,618 --> 01:47:18,359
lighter that's ridiculous I mean like

2840
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,100
you know uh I mean I did it with like

2841
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:22,500
when we when Mendo first went legal and

2842
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:24,539
we were allowed 10 000 square feet yeah

2843
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:25,618
which is far larger than a 30 lighter

2844
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:28,079
you know

2845
01:47:25,618 --> 01:47:29,880
um yeah small by today's standards right

2846
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,279
now but still

2847
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:34,679
um you know it's it's a chunk of pounds

2848
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:36,539
yeah so it works you know

2849
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:38,760
um and then on top of this too it's

2850
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:40,139
really easy to do this at a small scale

2851
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,699
for everybody that's just trying to

2852
01:47:40,139 --> 01:47:44,340
smoke better wheat

2853
01:47:41,698 --> 01:47:46,079
yeah totally you know if you might only

2854
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:48,119
have you might only have one or two or

2855
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:49,920
three contractors or something

2856
01:47:48,118 --> 01:47:51,359
you know if you're just growing for your

2857
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,219
personal smoke and it's for you or

2858
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:55,738
whatever like then it's really easy to

2859
01:47:53,219 --> 01:47:57,779
like baby it and then you'll really see

2860
01:47:55,738 --> 01:47:59,099
yeah for sure you know and there might

2861
01:47:57,779 --> 01:48:00,420
be a time too when people want to

2862
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:02,639
experiment with it or whatever where

2863
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:04,199
like they get to a point where

2864
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,118
um you know you might end up like if

2865
01:48:04,198 --> 01:48:08,460
especially if it's just for you you

2866
01:48:06,118 --> 01:48:10,859
might end up like trimming some and then

2867
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:12,840
leave half the bag cured and super nice

2868
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:14,759
in a cool spot that's dry

2869
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,319
yeah and go check on your weed a month

2870
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,300
later and see if you like the wheat in

2871
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:21,479
your jar better or see if you like the

2872
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:23,219
the flour you just broke off the branch

2873
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:24,479
and hold the joint with you might be

2874
01:48:23,219 --> 01:48:27,179
surprised

2875
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:28,500
yeah I know I know Bodie has this

2876
01:48:27,179 --> 01:48:30,719
perfect room

2877
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:33,060
um or did at his house that was like a

2878
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,859
humidor and because where he lived is

2879
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:36,239
just that perfect oh yeah I know he said

2880
01:48:34,859 --> 01:48:37,380
he's there's some weed in there from

2881
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:41,099
like

2882
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:43,560
a long time years yeah and and it's all

2883
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:46,079
hanging and it's on the branch and you

2884
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,719
know like I've noticed even with seeds

2885
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:50,100
like if they're stored in their Bud they

2886
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:52,679
last longer it's like a natural

2887
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:54,480
protection for it so you know I think

2888
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:56,039
there's a lot of good aspects even if

2889
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:57,599
you're just making seeds and drying

2890
01:48:56,039 --> 01:48:59,300
seeds there's a lot of good aspects to

2891
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,980
keeping it under pressure

2892
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:06,239
to bury our seed

2893
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:08,459
in um in uh 55 gallon drums and it would

2894
01:49:06,238 --> 01:49:11,339
all be on the cola yeah you wouldn't

2895
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:13,920
deseed it you would store it you know on

2896
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:15,840
a dry Cola yeah it makes it great it

2897
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:17,520
makes great storage makes great storage

2898
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:19,199
they're not they're not rubbing up

2899
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,719
against each other I mean a lot of

2900
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,158
people don't know this right but uh you

2901
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:25,739
know Caleb and I were just talking about

2902
01:49:23,158 --> 01:49:28,198
it where like that tiger stripe rubs off

2903
01:49:25,738 --> 01:49:30,839
oh yeah it's it's a thin layer it's not

2904
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:34,259
an it's it's more like a super thin

2905
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:37,199
tight fitting skin shell than it is like

2906
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:39,119
an embossed feature of a hard shell so

2907
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:41,399
if you people that start people that

2908
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:42,899
like hand Harvest their seeds and all

2909
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:44,819
that and they treat them really lightly

2910
01:49:42,899 --> 01:49:46,259
they could end up getting all these dark

2911
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:48,658
tiger stripes you start putting them

2912
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:50,880
through like a blower and sifting them

2913
01:49:48,658 --> 01:49:52,439
really nice and doing all this extra

2914
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,239
work to make sure people get perfect

2915
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:55,859
seeds and all of a sudden you could end

2916
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:58,319
up with some pale seeds that were dark

2917
01:49:55,859 --> 01:50:00,179
before yeah because they lost their

2918
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:03,899
tiger stripe because it just frictioned

2919
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:06,779
off it's a thin almost transparent skin

2920
01:50:03,899 --> 01:50:09,359
with dark stripes so yeah it washed it

2921
01:50:06,779 --> 01:50:11,219
come off seeds constantly yeah and a lot

2922
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:13,019
of us use blowers that make a lot of

2923
01:50:11,219 --> 01:50:14,579
seed so you're just yeah and what's

2924
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:16,560
interesting is I was actually just

2925
01:50:14,579 --> 01:50:18,539
talking the last few weeks to uh to a

2926
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,219
Jamaican who was telling me about how

2927
01:50:18,539 --> 01:50:22,679
they store seeds and they can't bury

2928
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:25,260
them they store them in in big 55 gallon

2929
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:28,940
drums in Jamaica and they store them

2930
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:31,380
basically either on bud or in the shake

2931
01:50:28,939 --> 01:50:34,439
because it acts like a natural

2932
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:37,139
insulation and protects it from the Heat

2933
01:50:34,439 --> 01:50:40,439
and it works way they'd rather have a

2934
01:50:37,139 --> 01:50:42,840
big drum full of shake and Seed than a

2935
01:50:40,439 --> 01:50:44,519
big or you know Buds and Seed then a big

2936
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:47,880
thing just full of seed

2937
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:49,800
because it'll die someone asked is it a

2938
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,600
more Indica trait tiger stripes I've

2939
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:52,860
noticed it a lot in afghanis and and

2940
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:55,739
things the bigger seeds that I see

2941
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:57,599
typically from afghanis but it's not a a

2942
01:50:55,738 --> 01:51:01,198
general trait you can apply like that

2943
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:02,639
one of the but never mind go on no as

2944
01:51:01,198 --> 01:51:04,618
you can say a lot of the land race like

2945
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,840
Africans and and Malawi's they tend to

2946
01:51:04,618 --> 01:51:08,819
be smaller black seeds yeah what I've

2947
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:10,279
noticed it also depends on what the

2948
01:51:08,819 --> 01:51:14,819
mother was

2949
01:51:10,279 --> 01:51:16,859
right so um you know you uh if you're

2950
01:51:14,819 --> 01:51:19,799
you know if your seeds are forming in

2951
01:51:16,859 --> 01:51:21,719
some kind of Equatorial sativa they're

2952
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,000
going to tend to be smaller because the

2953
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:25,920
flower clusters and the calyxes they're

2954
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,420
forming in are also small

2955
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,039
yeah and it depends on when it's

2956
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:30,658
pollinated and where on the plant it's

2957
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:31,979
pollinated how big the seed there's so

2958
01:51:30,658 --> 01:51:34,859
many things that go into factors but

2959
01:51:31,979 --> 01:51:38,939
like the tiger striping you don't see it

2960
01:51:34,859 --> 01:51:40,679
a ton in traditional land race uh narrow

2961
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:42,719
leaf plants and there was an aspect

2962
01:51:40,679 --> 01:51:44,880
where there was for a long time there

2963
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:47,340
was a misnomer among the community where

2964
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,840
you know if it wasn't tiger striped

2965
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:50,520
enough that means you didn't let it go

2966
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,880
to full maturity and you were trying to

2967
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:56,940
sell young or immature seeds or you were

2968
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:58,739
trying to cheat a bit or whatever and so

2969
01:51:56,939 --> 01:52:00,059
there's a thing with seeds where people

2970
01:51:58,738 --> 01:52:02,218
are very visual

2971
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:03,600
yeah and you know we have you know we

2972
01:52:02,219 --> 01:52:06,118
have friends or whatever that like won't

2973
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:09,239
sell the pale ones even though they get

2974
01:52:06,118 --> 01:52:11,399
crazy germ rates on them yeah I've I've

2975
01:52:09,238 --> 01:52:13,859
kept a lot of lines off the market that

2976
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:15,420
were just light or lost their stripes in

2977
01:52:13,859 --> 01:52:16,738
the blower they just kept them off the

2978
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:18,960
market because I knew it would be more

2979
01:52:16,738 --> 01:52:21,238
of a pain in the ass to explain all that

2980
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,618
and teach every single person than to do

2981
01:52:21,238 --> 01:52:25,500
that

2982
01:52:22,618 --> 01:52:26,579
oh my God color-coded seeds

2983
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,198
um if you could if you go to

2984
01:52:26,579 --> 01:52:30,300
greenhouse's site on their

2985
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:31,678
accomplishments the color-coded seeds is

2986
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:34,139
one of the top

2987
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:36,960
I don't go to greenhouse's site although

2988
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:38,460
I will say I did before I before I

2989
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:42,060
dissed them too hard that when I was

2990
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:43,618
traveling in the 90s to Holland a bunch

2991
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:46,500
um they had a great coffee shop in the

2992
01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:49,500
90s yeah

2993
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:51,600
oh and he just took himself out for

2994
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,939
whatever reason

2995
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:57,619
see if we'd get it back in hold on

2996
01:52:53,939 --> 01:52:57,618
where is he where is he

2997
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:01,639
what the hell

2998
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:06,000
let's see

2999
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:06,839
not maybe he uh maybe he got a phone

3000
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,219
