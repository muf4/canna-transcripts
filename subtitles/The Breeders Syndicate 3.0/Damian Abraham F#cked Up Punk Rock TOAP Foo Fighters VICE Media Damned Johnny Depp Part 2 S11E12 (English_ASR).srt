check it out it's a great interview I'm

25
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,599
probably going to um smash them together

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,439
afterwards and make it one long um 2hour

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,079
interview

28
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,079
as it was meant to be presented um just

29
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,239
to make it easier and plus YouTube kind

30
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,158
of squashed it with the 18 plus because

31
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,959
of I think his band name or whatever so

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,478
um yeah I hope you guys enjoy like

33
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,640
there's a lot more than just punk rock

34
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,239
stuff in here uh it's one of the more

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,959
fascinating interviews I've ever done

36
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,640
and and based on the response I think

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,438
we're probably going to do some um

38
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,680
future episodes together interviewing

39
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,039
other people about Cana and punk rock

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,840
and um try to remarry some of that um

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,479
history that that was there during the

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,240
late 70s uh you know High Times

43
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,359
presented a lot of that um that musical

44
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,239
influence in genre along with our

45
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:45,000
culture and it kind of got just washed

46
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:47,478
out down to RAR and Grateful Dead and

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,879
all that but there was a a major punk

48
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,759
rock aspect to Canada obviously it's

49
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,839
Outlaw culture and um that ties in very

50
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,000
close so yeah um I hope you enjoy and

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,799
again Watch part one if you haven't seen

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,718
it yet and um we'll roll on in so thank

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,640
you for uh taking time to watch it with

54
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,878
us it's funny when you go on tour with

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,560
those hug like any time you going toward

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:15,359
like a a real professional band yeah um

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,360
you can tell they practice and they like

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,640
I would know anything about that yeah no

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,519
same exactly I couldn't imagine doing

60
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,119
that [ __ ] like beforehand and then

61
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,560
sometimes you see a band or be on tour

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,680
with a band you're like oh [ __ ] they say

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,280
the same thing every night

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,400
yeah and then you realize oh because

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,719
that way you're not just up there

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,439
fumbling for the words and you're not

67
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,359
like oh what was I trying to say here or

68
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,400
yeah you know dissing Taylor Swift or

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,120
something when you go off script

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
like mistakes can happen on stage when

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,519
you go off SCP that's for sure yeah

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,158
that's why I guess these bands have

73
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,400
these things these protocols that they

74
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:57,799
kind of follow at a certain point it we

75
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,480
were like I don't want to say this band

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,879
because I'm going to say like I'm

77
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,518
mocking but there's this like hardcore

78
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,959
band that went on tour the huge band and

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,039
uh for weeks before maybe a month before

80
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,280
they were in rehearsals before this

81
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,878
because they were like this is a huge

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,959
opportunity for us so we want to go out

83
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,959
there and and show the [ __ ] show the

84
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,719
fans that this band what we got and be

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,000
our best version of ourselves yeah and I

86
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,400
think back to when [ __ ] up did our

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,318
tour with Tenacious D and the Foo

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,760
Fighters and I'm like oh that probably

89
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,878
would have served us really well to have

90
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,759
that approach versus our approach of

91
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,399
just show up on the plane and try and do

92
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,318
the exact same

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,039
yeah like the exact same thing we do in

94
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,238
a club to 25 people to like 40,000

95
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,878
people looking for their seats but

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
that's what's so punk rock about it I

97
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:44,239
mean really realistically that's that's

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
what appeals to punk rock well and I

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,560
think it's also realistically all I'm

100
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:52,119
capable of yeah yeah that's too that

101
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,959
too like I I think there sometimes I'll

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,759
talk to people or see people in bands

103
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,360
and I'm like why are you doing punk like

104
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,039
you could clearly be doing anything in

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,799
this world world but yeah this is all I

106
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,959
I'm really capable of speaking of which

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,159
I was listening to the the Mike canella

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,560
episode oh yeah and I was almost

109
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,798
heartbroken when when you talked about

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,399
Captain Jazz and whether it was a punk

111
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,439
rock p and I was like I don't know I was

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
like yes it's a [ __ ] punk band it

113
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,639
drove me [ __ ] nuts that he didn't

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,839
want to claim it know like own it well

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,439
it's interesting I think because people

116
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,879
have a lot of baggage around that word I

117
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,240
guess yeah and I think it's put on to

118
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,959
them by other people around them

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,800
claiming it and being so vocal with what

120
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:41,000
it is and the version of punk that waves

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,560
the flag the highest is a very defined

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,918
thing sure but you know as you and I

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,680
both know that's

124
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,959
like probably the smallest I would argue

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,038
one of the least interesting parts of it

126
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:59,120
yeah yeah and that like when it becomes

127
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:01,038
bands like CPP Jazz and the clean in New

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Zealand and when all the stuff can be

129
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,399
part of punk that's when it's most

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,038
exciting to me I'm always shock yeah

131
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,239
like it's crazy when people blow back on

132
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,439
that [ __ ] too like I've had people like

133
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,439
push back on on the idea that like

134
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,800
certain bands were Punk like that's not

135
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,160
Punk um I'm doing it jail by afro voice

136
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,600
because that's I heard that that's

137
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,880
exactly who I'm thinking of when yeah

138
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,479
we're talking about those new New

139
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,719
Zealand bands he's like that's not Punk

140
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,800
and I'm like well they call themselves

141
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,400
Punk they were listening to punk before

142
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,000
that and this was their reaction to it

143
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,519
so so how can one version of this thing

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,959
be any more valid than someone else's

145
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,599
version of this thing yeah and uh yeah

146
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,359
that's it's but I think that's why a lot

147
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,879
of people internalize I feel like turn

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
it into Punk if there's anything we do

149
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,000
for people it's like maybe like a brief

150
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:52,839
moment of punk therapy where uh people

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,560
come on and they're like I don't know if

152
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,638
this thing was Punk and I'm like no no

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,680
here's here's my evidence that I've

154
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,600
uncovered about why it is punk and then

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,439
they they leave and I feel they're a

156
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,639
little more at peace with their their

157
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,120
connection to punk rock I certainly

158
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,800
noticed that with Tim hidecker he came

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,280
on the show and he was so push backy

160
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,520
about Punk stuff and then ever since

161
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,198
then he's talking about Punk all the

162
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,519
time now so I feel like we had a

163
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,199
breakthrough therapy moment yeah yeah

164
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,719
yeah I don't know why I expected Mike

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,080
canel just to own it like so much like

166
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,800
because to me Captain Jazz like granted

167
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,639
they're not [ __ ] discharged right

168
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,079
like but the everything they brought

169
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,918
even though it was during I mean they

170
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,598
calling it the emo era isn't really

171
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,560
accurate either I mean I I know they get

172
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,199
stomped in there which kind of separates

173
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,439
it a bit but just their whole attitude

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,280
of just stinging off key and [ __ ]

175
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,598
everything yeah and it's fast and it's

176
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:49,279
aggressive in its own way too I I saw

177
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:53,279
them do a reunion show at um the house

178
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:56,239
of Vans yeah in H with g

179
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,559
g and cap and Jazz were like

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
unfuckingbelievable I remember just

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,120
being like

182
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
holy sh this is incredible like just

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
like just

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,360
like could not believe how sick the show

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
was and how great it was and I was

186
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,960
jealous well and I was never the biggest

187
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,720
Joon of Arc fan I'm more of a Jon of Arc

188
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,439
fan now than I was at the time I

189
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,000
remember going to see him and I wanted

190
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:23,680
10 yard fight and that was definitely

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,240
right they were offering uh but CPP Jazz

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,478
I was like this this is and I like the

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,079
record before but live it just really

194
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:34,719
blew me away and yeah I think it's Punk

195
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,839
and that's that's the only way I want

196
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,440
Punk is when it's all those bands and I

197
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,878
think it's it's so

198
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:44,478
funny like my my motto on the show is

199
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,560
that like everybody's somebody's poser

200
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,240
yeah that's for real yeah yeah there's

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,158
every because every single person that

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,840
comes on the show they'll not be another

203
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:56,879
person without exception I can think of

204
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,279
that'll be like y [ __ ] that dude yeah

205
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,560
sucked they weren't part of it it's like

206
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,679
what like you know like uh like it just

207
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,158
it never it never fails and I can think

208
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,680
of that like all the time where there's

209
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:13,959
like people that are so adamant that

210
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,280
like this is punk this is my version of

211
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:20,198
punk and and my version of punk is the

212
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:22,239
true version of punk and just other

213
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,840
people that just clown on those people

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,360
for for trying to be that person and

215
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,679
it's just it's I don't know it's it it's

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,158
interesting how

217
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,038
you know it's like that Star Wars thing

218
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:34,519
the more you tighten your fist the more

219
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,439
it slips through your fingers and I

220
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,320
think yeah the harder you try to claim

221
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,680
Punk the cornier it looks and I say this

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,640
as a person with a podcast called Turn

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,958
it a punk so yeah right I'm just as

224
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,799
corny as the next

225
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:50,719
one so give me give me your best um

226
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,439
cannabis touring weirdest Story I mean

227
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
one you can actually tell on the podcast

228
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,200
oh yeah um there's a lot someone won't

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,440
get

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,399
mad uh what making the

231
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,600
wrestlers so um and I I'm sure this guy

232
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,240
would be totally fine with me saying his

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,639
name as a wrestler maybe I won't say the

234
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,519
wrestler's name so I went to a guy's

235
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,039
wrestling school that was in Atlanta

236
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,159
Georgia and that's probably why I'm not

237
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,519
saying because I don't think Atlanta has

238
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:19,399
medical at this point even um yeah and

239
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,200
so I I we go to like I don't know my way

240
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,159
around Atlanta but I've I've been told

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,759
from people that this is not a great

242
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,719
part of Atlanta subsequently and there's

243
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,600
a huge strip club and we go into the

244
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,680
back and there's a wrestling school the

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,440
back of the strip club and it's the

246
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:38,239
coolest most inclusive awesome wrestling

247
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,240
school I've ever been to and uh I I was

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,839
just so great and all the kids are

249
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,079
awesome and it just reeks of weed the

250
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,560
whole time and I'm like [ __ ] I gotta get

251
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,078

252
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,958
younger kids there so I don't want ask

253
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:54,479
any these kids and the wrestlers we were

254
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,838
rolling with were straight edge uh so

255
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
I'm like well I don't want to ask these

256
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,839
guys yeah and then I noticed the guy

257
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,919
who's running the wrestling school is

258
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:07,600
like zigzag brand blunts those like

259
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,399
zigzag but like with tobacco in them not

260
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,959
even with with weed in them and I'm like

261
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,600
oh that's weird yeah and so later on

262
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,399
we're at the end of the shoot I'm like

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,560
man it really smells like uh weed in

264
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,839
here he's like oh that's from the strip

265
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,679
club next door and I'm like oh so could

266
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,120
I go in there and buy weed he's like

267
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,679
he's like well I could probably go in

268
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,879
there and buy weed but if you went there

269
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,000
they'd Eat You Alive yeah and I'm like

270
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,559
oh [ __ ] and he's like but you want weed

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,720
and I'm like yeah and he's like well I I

272
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,719
you know I smoke weed all the time the

273
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
reason I'm smoking these is because I'm

274
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,839

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,399

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
want to get weed and I'm like sure but I

277
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,639
don't want to put you in a weird spot if

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
you're on probation he's like no I gota

279
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,839
get other

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,440
drugs probably good thing I didn't name

281
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,040
the guy now so we go down the street to

282
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,680
this gas station and we pull in the gas

283
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,838

287
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720

288
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,160

289
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,560
and we've got all the camera gear on the

290
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,799
car and we're like this is a weird gas

291
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,119
station I think I could have bought

292
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,039
anything at that g gas station I prob

293
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
could have bought a rocket launcher if I

294
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,639
wanted there like a bunch of dudes

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
Milling around and then he comes out and

296
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,959
he's like here and just tosses me a

297
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,479
bunch of like literal nickel bags and I

298
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,799
had seen a nickel bag before yeah and

299
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,399
just here and he's like the guy will

300
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:31,759
give you another like how many for like

301
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,759
20 bucks more and everyone in the crew

302
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,958
is like yeah yeah I get more so we get

303
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,799
more so we got all these nickel bags and

304
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:41,239
I go back to the hotel room and I smoked

305
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,359
it and it was like I don't know if it

306
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,039
was laced I don't know what was up I had

307
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,759
smoked in a few days too yeah but I'm

308
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,439
sitting in the bathtub and I'm like this

309
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,639
is the [ __ ] most Stone I think I've

310
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,639
ever been of this random nickel bag from

311
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,680
the

312
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,720
gas uh I'm trying to think of uh I mean

313
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,120
did you did you have clothes on still

314
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,959
were you oh yeah yeah definitely I was

315
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,078
clo you weren't fiddling with yourself

316
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,199
[ __ ] fully dressed still was able to

317
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,519
contemplate the fact that it might be

318
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,480
laced so it probably wasn't laced if put

319
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:21,360
it together like that uh another time we

320
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,959
were we went to Russia and we've been to

321
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,560
Russia before and the first time we went

322
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,439
to Russia we're like oh this is crazy

323

like drinking it's like it's not crazy

375
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,719
by any other band standard but by [ __ ]

376
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,240
up standard this is probably the wildest

377
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,639
party we've ever had in in in after a

378
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,680
show and it was very tame and at a

379
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,320
certain point we're like you guys should

380
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,519
go back to the uh like go home because

381
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,040
we got to go to the airport soon

382
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,839
everyone's like sure sure and they're

383
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:43,559
like oh we can't leave and we're like

384
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,600
why not they're like look through the

385
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,039
people and you look through the people

386
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,040
and the whole Corridor of this apartment

387
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:55,278
floor is just full of cops like there

388
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:58,039
must be like 20 cops down the hallway in

389
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,879
a gauntlet and we're like oh

390
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,159
[ __ ] what what do we do and they're like

391
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,720
we're just not going to let them in and

392
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:09,559
we're like what what what happen they

393
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,240
might leave and we're like but if they

394
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:16,359
don't they're like oh big

395
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,480
trouble the weed and we're like oh [ __ ]

396
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,480
So eventually there's like this

397
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,959
negotiation process that goes on where

398
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,720
they agree to allow every Russian person

399
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,958
to leave except for the staff from Vice

400
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,959
Russia and us who have to stay so we get

401
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:35,078
the weed out which is great yeah so then

402
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:37,278
the cops swarm in and immediately arrest

403
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:40,638
all the people from Vice Russia and

404
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,159
we're like oh [ __ ] yeah it's real

405
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,159
serious and it's just us and these

406
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,439
Russian cops they're like you can go to

407
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,480
sleep now

408
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,199
and okay so we all go to everyone in the

409
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,039
band pretty much drunk except for me and

410
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,639
every just passes out and it's just like

411
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,519

414
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,958

416
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,599

483
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,079
was Lion's man in there maybe it wasn't

484
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,679
Lion's man something like that though

485
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,079
something they even like that it wasn't

486
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,480
M Lin me because there was no mushrooms

487
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,439
in it but it was like all herbs and we

488
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,679
smoked it and it got a Super Stone like

489
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,159
I don't know what it was that was with

490
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,960

494
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,960

for a second I don't know what it was

506
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,798
but we were getting way higher I inter

507
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm interviewing um Wally duck one of

508
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,558
the old famous Australian breeders

509
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,279
tomorrow and I'm going to ask him what's

510
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:31,079
that [ __ ] you guys got over there ain't

511
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,200
we but help the weed help the weed there

512
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:36,678
was another thing uh we used to have in

513
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,400
Toronto in the in the dirty 90s called

514
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,798
poppers like not you know the poppers

515
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,640
you sniff but you get a popper bong have

516
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,158
you heard of this thing no I know what

517
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,600
poppers are

518
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:50,640
yeah they help the butthole not hurt

519
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,678
this this is in a in a way uh more

520
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,360
intense and it's like a it's like a

521
00:19:52,679 --> 00:20:00,519
giant circular glass bong uhuh and then

522
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:02,279
there's like a metal uh piece in it like

523
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,839
that goes on the top and you stuff it

524
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:08,839
with tobacco and weed and then you suck

525
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,519
and it pops it makes like an audible pop

526
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,519
and that was like a popper and it was

527
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,798
like back in Toronto because we had

528
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:18,440
after Rosy's hash dried up we had mids

529
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:20,200
mids mids mids in Ontario for a long

530
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,360
time and so that was the way people

531
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,159
would mainly smoke their weed back then

532
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,319
I guess to get rid of the weed

533
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,600
tast that's kind of fascinating I wonder

534
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,240
what device like At first I thought you

535
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,399
were describing a gravity bong but it

536
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,919
doesn't sound like that at all no no

537
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,480
it's like a circle no and the only time

538
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,038
I've ever seen one since was actually in

539
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,720
Australia in in Melbourne the guy was

540
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,519
like oh this is how we smoke weed here

541
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,159
when I went to some someone's house

542
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,759
there one time yeah and it was like how

543
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,400
weird I haven't seen this since the

544
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,400
dirty days in

545
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,480
Toronto there's always like that hope

546
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,678
that you like show up and it happens

547
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,480

554
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,399
definitely want to meet this person and

555
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,839
smoke with them and would love to get

556
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,600
their

557
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,278
connect because yeah uh that's all I

558
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,038
want to do before we play a show anyways

559
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,720
just smoke weed and chill and talk to

560
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,278
people so I like when we go to places

561
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,558
that have lounges or or vapor bars and

562
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,519
occasionally you luck out and you meet

563
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:30,480
someone who's super chill or or has

564
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,158
great weed or you know so there's been

565
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,960
there's been some great experiences that

566
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,880
have come through cannabis and touring

567
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,558
some dark times too some really weird I

568
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,000
bet it's really depressing Dark Times

569
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:44,200
yeah like when someone shows up and they

570
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,079
give you the weed and you're like [ __ ] I

571
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,640
gotta smoke it now like I'm obligated to

572
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,839
smoke this person but you're like

573
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,200
looking at you're like I I don't want to

574
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,278
be a snob but there's there's this is

575
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,480
really going to be harsh this is definit

576
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:59,720
something ain't right this is this

577
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,919
doesn't look like it's supposed to look

578
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,159
uh but also it gives me a great sense of

579
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,480
privilege when I come home and I think

580
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,400
that's probably why I smoke out of

581
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,038
literally any rig and I don't give a

582
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,919
[ __ ] of what the Banger looks like and

583
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,359
all this sort of stuff because I've been

584
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,200
in places where I've been smoking Twigs

585
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,639
off the top of a coat can so yeah yeah

586
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,519
everything is co cans make everything

587
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,120
accessible everything's jungle boys

588
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,319
compared to

589
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:28,199
that so one of one of uh the people in

590
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:30,678
in our Discord asked you had a cannabis

591
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,200
base podcast that's no longer available

592
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,798
any insight into where it went yeah I

593
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,440
wish it would still around um my um the

594
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:43,400
host Buddha Blaze who a good friend of

595
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,120
mine um we kind of just lost touch and

596
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,480
then he took down the episodes and yeah

597
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,038
I really enjoyed doing it I learned a

598
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,480
lot from Buddha Buddha and uh Buddha was

599
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,079
obviously on his Canabis Journey long

600
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,599
before I was but I think we both kind of

601
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,278
met a lot of the same people around the

602
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,319
same time and really good friends and

603
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:03,880
and did this podcast for years together

604
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,000
like yeah that legalization session I

605
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,480
was talking about where like I think

606
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,558
we've just seen the end of an era was us

607
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,319
recording that podcast together and yeah

608
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,879
like hopefully one day it comes back

609
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,200
like I I haven't talked to boot in a

610
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,120
long time I still have deep love for him

611
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,000
and stuff but I hopefully he archived it

612
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,119
somewhere yeah hopefully he did I don't

613
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,919
know it's it's it's weird how digital

614
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,558
stuff works like that like I kind of

615
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,559
looked at digital stuff as just being

616
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,720
like oh it's there forever like it's

617
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,558
just on the internet you can't erase it

618
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,240
and now realizing how much stuff has

619
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,440
just disappeared yeah from there's a

620
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,120
black hole for it too yeah yeah and

621
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,360
there's there's interesting periods

622
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,239
where like the 80s and the 90s are super

623
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,558
well documented in terms of videos and

624
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,720
and audio recordings and all these sorts

625
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:57,240
of things but I find like the early

626
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,159
2000s because digital cameras weren't so

627
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,720
hot people weren't really uploading them

628
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,880
those a lot of those geoc City sites are

629
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,759
now gone oh yeah and like cdrs don't

630
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,919
last forever and all this sort of stuff

631
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:13,038
so it feels like that's like a black

632
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
hole culturally uh in terms of stuff

633
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,200
when you go on YouTube and look for

634
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,399
bands from that era I'm always shocked

635
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,278
at how little there is yeah it's really

636
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,320
hard to find some [ __ ] from that era

637
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,519
yeah it's like I guess vinyl in the 90s

638
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:29,038
it just was not not the format of the

639
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,960
time so give me your

640
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,200
it's hard to do this because like as a

641
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,038
as a punk rock historian that you are

642
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,038
give me the top five off the top of your

643
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:42,798
head best LPS that people should listen

644
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:45,960
to oh LPS that actually probably is is

645
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:50,278
easier because I think it's harder to

646
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,600
pull off a punk way harder L yeah seven

647
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,798
there's like thousands of bands that

648
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,480
have yeah incredible seven Ines but LPS

649
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,079
it's it's a much smaller list um

650
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,000
off the top of my

651
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:09,759
head H so Punk and hardcore okay yeah 10

652
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,200
or five five five [ __ ] okay um feel the

653
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,519
darkness by poison idea okay that's like

654
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,798
a a good one perfect

655
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:22,038
record

656
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:25,359
uh bastard wind of pain Japanese band

657
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:27,158
They it it sounds like motohead covering

658
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,759
discharge like it's oh that's kind of

659
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,039
rad it's perfect like like it it's just

660
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,798
it's

661
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:39,319
unbelievable

662
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:41,000
um [ __ ] okay so I got two spots left oh

663
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:42,558
wait no I got three spots left okay good

664
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,839
so then I can say incorrect Thoughts by

665
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,798
the subhumans oh yeah um but I think I

666
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,558
actually weirdly like the CD presents

667
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:51,679
version more because it has the song

668
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:55,038
Behind the smile on it they Chang the

669
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,880
track listing on the C presents one and

670
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,119
the mix is weirder but I love that song

671
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,399
so much I think behind the smile might

672
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:03,239
be one of my favorite songs ever L

673
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:07,959
really underrated band too oh Canadian

674
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,480
subhumans are yeah I I used to argue

675
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,880
forever that they were the better of the

676
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,919
two subhumans but now having seen both

677
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,440
subhumans live the UK subhumans are

678
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,559
they're still good too to this day so

679
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,360
good like yeah dick is one of the

680
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,918
greatest front people of all time and

681
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:28,678
yeah so I got love for both

682
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:33,440
subhumans okay um I'm like going around

683
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:36,000
the world trying to think of the mush uh

684
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,120
okay fill your boots or

685
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,679
mush no I think I'm gon to say mush by

686
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,678
leather

687
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,600
face

688
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:50,080
um and

689
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:53,439
then for the final slot

690
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,359
ah probably the first Teenage Head LP oh

691
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,960
that's so good yeah yeah yeah like I

692
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,519
think these ones are like yeah like I

693
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,840
think these are records that are like I

694
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,079
think never mind the bollocks I think is

695
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,639
like a perfect Punk record I think that

696
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,918
Saints record could easily be on there

697
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,080
too yeah um there's like records that

698
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,880
are just you know canonically like like

699
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,798
the damn actually all all the all the

700
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,760
damn records the whole way through could

701
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,440
like I love the way to strawberries I

702
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,679
love strawberries I I kind of like it

703
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,679
too I thought I was the only person that

704
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:26,679
did to me that song uh ignite sounds

705
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,919
like what AFI would kind of be doing

706
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,559
later on sonically

707
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,559
wanted to ask Dave about that record

708
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,759
because like it it's perfect like I did

709
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,440
I had do lights for them when they did

710
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,119
that record grave mistake in the 90s on

711
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,480
Nitro late 90s early 2000s I guess and I

712
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,000
had to do lights at a show and I never

713
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,599
done lights and I walked backstage to

714
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,159
meet them as they're saying that was the

715
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,480

817
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,639

start the podcast because there's just

819

827
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,679
why I created the podcast but Joan and I

853
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:03,918
this [ __ ] and that's that's when I

854
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,960
realized that this podcast there's

855
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,799
something to it because like no matter

856
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,480
how

857
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:12,960
famous someone gets if they were really

858
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,720
into it like really into the [ __ ] it

859
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,440
scars you for life right like it just

860
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,480
never leaves you completely so I think

861
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,200
and I've noticed this from doing the

862
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,960
show like everyone loves getting a

863
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,440
chance to talk about it and and like

864
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
like once they get over there if they

865
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,080
have any baggage attached to the word I

866
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,919
mean but like for the most part I find

867
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,038
like bringing people back that moment

868
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:38,120
and getting to talk to them about these

869
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:41,359
random seven inch only bands that meant

870
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:46,038
the world to them as kids like sure yeah

871
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:47,759
yeah and I I I weirdly uh yeah I don't

872
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:50,879
know I think every single one baring a

873
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,200
few I like walk away from like ah [ __ ]

874
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,519
yeah I love doing this there's been a

875
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,759
couple can't imagine been a couple that

876
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,919
have an aired and a couple that have

877
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,079
aired where I'm still like yeah I don't

878
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,399
know that's all part of it though yeah

879
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,038
I've G through that too with the weed

880
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,879
stuff like I've looked back like [ __ ]

881
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,000
have you have you ever been worked has

882
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,679
there ever been someone you met and

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,320
you're like oh this guy's cool and then

884
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,800
been like absolutely absolutely

885
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,960
had it goes yeah for a long time that's

886
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,359
how it goes though the Canabis world's

887
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,320
interesting because

888
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,759
it's it's such a like I guess like Punk

889
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,960
is like is so different because Punk

890
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,200
there's

891
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,398
like like

892
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,439
um like a

893
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:40,838
moral side to it or like a a uh a

894
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,039
certain like group think that obviously

895
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:43,320
people think differently and everyone's

896
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,918
got different opinions within it but

897
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,240
we're all orientated more or less in the

898
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,118
same direction where cannabis and

899
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,439
wrestling just attract people from all

900
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,079
different walk Supply and all kinds of

901
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,639
people and and uh as long as the topic

902
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,560
stays on that one thing you have in

903
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,039
common everyone gets along I'm looking

904
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,599
forward to see how people take to this

905
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,880
one like I always want to do uh Punk

906
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,480
stuff with cannabis so uh even even like

907

positive people like feedback being like

917
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,919
as long as they don't know me they're

918
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:35,598
not like that

919
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,960
[ __ ] oh I I knew once Spencer also hit

920
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,280

921
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,240
like I'm like oh well that's that's all

922
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,560
like that's the thing about Punk and

923
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:47,639
hardcore that I love and I uh it didn't

924
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:52,239
really have this sort of ability in in

925
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:53,519
wrestling or or cannabis in that way

926
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,239
that you can always check someone's

927
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,159
resume oh yeah we're all like from

928
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,879
scenes and every scene like really

929
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:04,118
connect to each other and so yeah like

930
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,800
it's it is uh all you need like and and

931
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,680

00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:05,199
linked to it was not a weak guy at all

980
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,960
was just like a Libertarian dude in in

981
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,159
uh London Ontario ran this bookstore

982
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,838
called City Lights Bookstore was just

983
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,279
filling people's parking meters um

984
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,679
opening on Sundays when you weren't

985
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,280
allowed to open on Sundays in in

986
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,559
Ontario uh selling the NWA record when

987
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,240
you weren't allowed to sell the NWA way

988
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:26,000
record in Canada and then he got really

989
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:29,639
into Jello in the dead candies because

990
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,719
of the pmrc trial yeah and on that

991
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:35,519
third uh spoken word record j's got that

992
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,078
track everybody's got a grow pot

993
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,440
everyone should smoke more pot I for

994
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,240
what the name of the song is right but

995
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,200
he mentions Jack hair and the emperor

996
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,159
has no clothes and uh Mark tried to

997
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,919
order that book in for the store and it

998
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,480
was a baned book in Canada at the time

999
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,280
so his distributors like we can't

1000
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,679
actually send you that book it's illegal

1001
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,040
in Canada and High Times was illegal

1002
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,358
back then bongs were illegal in Canada

1003
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,920
back then like it was very draon and

1004
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:03,759
cannabis laws and so he starts smuggling

1005
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,000
in the emperor has no clothes and and

1006
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,520
and High Times and they sold out really

1007
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,639
quickly and so he's like oh my God

1008
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,079
there's a market for this so it started

1009
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,679
bringing in more of that stuff and then

1010
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,079
it started bringing in various people I

1011
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,279
think Jack ha I forget who he brought in

1012
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,079
brought bunch of people in to do

1013
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,280
lectures brought jel ba afron actually

1014
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:24,280
to do a spoken word event I wonder how

1015
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,519
well they would have gotten along jell

1016
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,280
not like I can't imagine as jello about

1017
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,318
it quite a bit he's like hey we did not

1018
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,319
really get along too well and I'm like

1019
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,318
do his voice so

1020
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,599
well we went we Jello and I went on a

1021
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,920
cruise together we we've traveled some

1022
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,200
places he'd be fun to hang out with for

1023
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,039
sure he is definitely incredible to hang

1024
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:49,279
out with but it is

1025
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,838
um it's real like that's the thing about

1026
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,800
Jello it's not a character Jello yeah

1027
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,400
right and and so Mark brought him up

1028
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,240
there and and yeah just kind of get more

1029
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,519
more into cannabis through but it's

1030
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,118
through Jello by Afra and then

1031
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,480
eventually shows up in Vancouver and all

1032
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,760
that stuff in Vancouver with the

1033
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,960
Vancouver Seed Bank and you know that's

1034
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,480
so wild it all came through Jello yeah

1035
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,599
yeah and then actually weirdly so when

1036
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,679
he gets

1037
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:20,760
busted he had they busted two

1038
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:23,679
accomplices with a marijuana man and um

1039
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,119
Michelle rayy yeah and Michelle Remy got

1040
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:30,480
diagnosed with cancer and um when she

1041
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,039
got diagnosed they crossed the the

1042
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,480
infamous bull rider with an Afghan and

1043
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,279
madebe the Afghan bull rider writer y

1044
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,119
yeah and that was her strain before she

1045
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,560
passed away and then yeah that's the

1046
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,160
strain that Drake raps about in all his

1047
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,000
songs because there was a guy in Toronto

1048
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,480
that was getting it from out west and

1049
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,760
that was the guy that was selling to

1050
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,639
Drake in 40 back in the day so that's

1051
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,000
why Drake and 40 have deep ties to The

1052
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,838
Afghani bull rider but they just call it

1053
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,280
I guess bull rider yeah they just stole

1054
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,759
the bull rider her name just said [ __ ]

1055
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,640
it yeah there's some little clown from

1056
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,400
the US working with them that it's kind

1057
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,239
of leeched on to it too yeah it's of

1058
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,000
course because that's how it goes pre

1059
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,639
Kendrick Lamar situation that probably

1060
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,960
had a lot of name recog it did it did

1061
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,440
yeah Kendrick Lamar kind of turned that

1062
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,880
on his [ __ ] head huh yeah there's

1063
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,800
gonna be like a they not like us strain

1064
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,960
yeah yeah they should be they just ring

1065
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,280
the bull rider trrain that that's you

1066
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,318
know bull riders kind of lost to to the

1067
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,920
world it was a St from Fresno that made

1068
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:30,800
it down to San Diego and got really big

1069
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,039
but yeah was originally a a a black bull

1070
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,079
riter a black dude that was a bull riter

1071
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,759
that you know gave a dude a few clones

1072
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:39,160
the the sister clone still alive though

1073
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,680
called Old Betsy and that's the uh the

1074
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:42,519
actual sister of bull rider but bull

1075
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,679
rider itself is for all intents and

1076
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:47,639
purposes uh lost to the world as far as

1077
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,919
I know but Afghani bull rider was

1078
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,719
something that was like a white whale

1079
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,680
strain when I first heard yeah it was it

1080
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,078
was available in seeds online like as as

1081
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,919
far as like if you were in the forums

1082
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,318
you could get Afghan bull riders but it

1083
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,119
wasn't like something most people were

1084
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:03,000
tapped into or even knew about or cared

1085
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,318
about at the time and then it showed up

1086
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,920
in Toronto at one dispensory the the one

1087
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:12,358
that Drake would send his the black Uber

1088
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,639
black to pick up the weed from uh and it

1089
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:18,318
was $20 a gram yeah versus $10 a gram

1090
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:22,480
for pretty much everything else and it I

1091
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:25,119
guess has a a sister strain God's vagina

1092
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,599
that's lovely that was slightly cheaper

1093
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,200
as a

1094
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,000
I was more in the God's

1095
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,639
vagina uh U level of uh affordability

1096
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,400
than I was that more your flavor God's

1097
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,879
vagina I I like that's my thing with

1098
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,000
cannabis the best cannabis is the one

1099
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,119
you got in your hand yeah yeah I I

1100
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,519
obviously like my I think the I one time

1101
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:50,720
smoked um a a Sean's Haze that we'

1102
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:54,759
talked about this before that tasted

1103
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:57,480
insane um yeah that dirty banana uh I

1104
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,520
tried recently was really crazy and

1105
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,679
Spain uh I've tried like a lot of Str

1106
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,039
but like also at the same time like you

1107
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,000
know if I'm in a pinch as I said I'll

1108
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:10,519
smoke sticks off a tin can

1109
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,358
so yeah like the best weed is the one I

1110
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:15,079
can afford that's in my hand at that

1111
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:18,679
given time and then now I I mainly at

1112
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,839
home like I'll smoke cannabis but um in

1113
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,358
terms of like

1114
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:25,679
consuming it's dabs just because I find

1115
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:27,920
the efficiency of it and and a lot less

1116
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,759
carbon yeah long you don't end up junkie

1117
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,358
dabbing like me and

1118
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
[ __ ] going I think that's really

1119
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,318
important that you're talking about that

1120
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,039
because I think it's important that

1121
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:40,119
people know that there

1122
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:43,800
are high limits but there are limits

1123
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:46,079
that that maybe you should uh I had what

1124
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,359
years ago there was like these uh vapor

1125
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,200
bars in Toronto where you could bring

1126
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,679
weed and you could buy junk food and you

1127
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:53,519
pay a cover to go in but you couldn't

1128
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,318
buy weed there I'm sure you could

1129
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,639
probably buy weed but uh on the table

1130
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,039
and I remember talking a guy there and

1131
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:00,960
he's like you know what I do every time

1132
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,358
I'm about to hit the bong again I'm like

1133
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,358
no he's like I put it down and think

1134
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,920
about maybe I shouldn't and I think

1135
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,799
maybe ever since you told me yeah ever

1136
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,639
since you told me about what you're

1137
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,039
dealing with I'm like yeah that's that's

1138
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,318
what I look at the rig like now I'm like

1139
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,719
you know what maybe we'll take a break

1140
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,358
before this next dab yeah yeah because

1141
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,399
you don't want to be at a position where

1142
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,759
like that's no longer available to you

1143
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,119
and all of a sudden there's nothing but

1144
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,599
yeah nothing to control anxiety yeah how

1145
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,720
long longer you have now [ __ ]

1146
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,240
um I think I'm seven months in I don't

1147
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,598
[ __ ] know but like I'm already I

1148
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,199
supposed to go the 11 months but I'm

1149
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:37,559
just like like each day I'm wearing down

1150
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,519
more and more and more and more so

1151
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,720
probably not much longer I don't think

1152
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,079
are you gonna try like are you gonna go

1153
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:44,519
right back are you gonna try like

1154
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,039
Edibles first you think or no I'm just

1155
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:49,199
gonna go for flour and just try to smoke

1156
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,920
minimal just so I don't push anything

1157
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,919
too crazy yeah but I'm not a minimalist

1158
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,119
I'm an extremist at everything I do so I

1159
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,079
just know me I'm not GNA dab ever again

1160
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,039
for sure for sure I cannot dab ever

1161
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:04,359
again like I I I know because I I'll be

1162
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,440
doing it every 10 minutes again yeah

1163
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:10,519
that's the thing with dabs too is that

1164
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,358
it becomes uh because it doesn't have

1165
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:15,559
that harshness to it yeah like it be it

1166
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,159
just becomes real easy to kind of keep

1167
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,599
it going and with these devices dude

1168
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,000
like when you're not even having to use

1169
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,440
a torch and you know what I mean like

1170
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,480
it's just so easy to push the button

1171
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,440
three times okay it's ready pop you know

1172
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,920
but it's weird why does it not ever hit

1173
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,039
the same oh it's way different yeah I

1174
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,079
don't know right I don't know

1175
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:39,519
why I is it because maybe it's like not

1176
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,680
the immediate heat blast and it's just

1177
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:45,000
sort of more consistent heat flow to

1178
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,838
it I couldn't tell you but yeah it

1179
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,400
doesn't ever hit the same never hits the

1180
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:51,279
same I also wondered if that's maybe

1181
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,920
just the oxygen being cut off and that

1182
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,720
it could be rush it very well could be

1183
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,039
with like a bong rip or something like

1184
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,519
that dabs but yeah the I feel like

1185
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:03,719
dabbing is like a dying art form in a

1186
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:05,280
lot of ways yeah well I I know people

1187
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,558
are getting more sick over time and

1188
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,839
finally figuring that out

1189
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,720
so I guess we'll see where the future of

1190
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,039
that goes but I think as long as people

1191
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:15,118
got flat brims there's going to be

1192
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,239
people down you know what I

1193
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,039
mean I should show you my you want me to

1194
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,719
show you my crazy we talked let's see

1195
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,119
yeah let's see it this is the this is my

1196
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,118
crazy rig

1197
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,838
so wow who blew this do you know uh this

1198
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,559
is Redbeard okay and so the story on

1199
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:42,920
this piece is uh Vice years ago when I

1200
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:44,359
was kind of beginning to work on the

1201
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,519
wrestling tv show and kind of giving up

1202
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:48,400
on the Cannabis beat they were still

1203
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,159
making cannabis content and they decided

1204
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,680
to do a piece about Tokyo smoke which is

1205
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:54,838
now a dispensary here but when they

1206
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,399
originally opened which is definitely

1207
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:00,358
just a play to kind of get Market EXP I

1208
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:04,318
think they opened a

1209
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:06,920
cafe like head shop type and their their

1210
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,519
pitch was we're finally making

1211
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,440
goodlooking smoking devices and we're

1212
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,280
not g to make those shitty glass bongs

1213
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,519
we're gonna have great pieces that are

1214
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,800
going to be made out of ceramic yeah and

1215
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,400
they're going to be incredible for

1216
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,039
smoking in and we're going to have uh

1217
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,599
down stems that don't actually go into

1218
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:25,960
the water like all sorts of [ __ ] like

1219
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,920
these were clearly not designed by

1220
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,159
people when say ceramic too they were

1221
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,599
not finished inside so it was like this

1222
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:36,159
porous surface so it would just be

1223
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,400
disgusting yeah never clean it never get

1224
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:42,000
it clean it was you couldn't see through

1225
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,720
it like it was just a mess yeah and uh

1226
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,079
they did a piece on this place and in

1227
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:48,480
the piece the guy uh the designer is

1228
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,920
like yeah we're we're making these

1229
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,760
pieces that look like this they're not

1230
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,240
like those crappy Dragon bongs that you

1231
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,599
used to have yeah and so when this piece

1232
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,639
aired

1233
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,079
Vice began getting Vice Canada was

1234
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,799
getting Meed to death uh on I guess

1235
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:08,280
various places as people were like you

1236
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,200
know Dragon bongs like like people just

1237
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,839
were [ __ ] going after them the glass

1238
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,000
Community the Cannabis Community

1239
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,159
everybody so like what do we do what do

1240
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,679
we do and I'm like we got to hit up

1241
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,838
Redbeard and do a piece on Redbeard

1242
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,399
because Redbeard kind of like is

1243
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:23,078
the there's a lot of great glass blowers

1244
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,440
in Canada but Redbeard was sort of like

1245
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:27,079
like a real heart of the sort of

1246
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,400
community certainly out west um was and

1247
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,680
he did the glass Gathering where

1248
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,639
everyone would come and all the glass

1249
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,039
blowers from across can would come and

1250
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:36,558
blow glass all weekend and stuff so they

1251
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,480
go out and shoot with Redbeard and do

1252
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,280
this whole thing on the glass Gathering

1253
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,240
and do this whole piece and then they

1254
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,800
come back the piece airs and and then

1255
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:50,919
Redbeard posts on Facebook he's like hey

1256
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,599
here's this piece I made in tribute to

1257
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,838
the dragon bong that the vice camera gu

1258
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,960
smash when making the piece about me

1259
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:00,000
what they hadn't told me is that when

1260
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,639
they went out there redbeer was like

1261
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
actually weird coincidentally the first

1262
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,480
piece I made was actually a dragon and

1263
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,280
put the dragon bong on the table and the

1264
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,119
vice camera guy was doing close-ups and

1265
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,119
knock the bong off the table shattering

1266
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,640
it so Redbeard did this and then Vice

1267
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,720
bought the piece and then it was

1268
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,078
subsequently given to me at the end of

1269
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,598
the whole thing I was like you guys got

1270
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:26,000
to buy it like there's no there's no way

1271
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,920
around it yeah no [ __ ] that's [ __ ]

1272
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,838
awesome though right on his camera

1273
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,000
that's pretty cool but yeah that's why I

1274
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:34,798
don't smoke out of this piece because I

1275
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,920
would smash Dragon Ball yeah never do

1276
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:39,000
ever do I have I have a lot of pieces

1277
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,680
like that like a A Clockwork Orange

1278
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
piece that that was custom made that

1279
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:45,039
I've never done like touched with

1280
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,679

1287
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:01,960
whole weekend and made this like

1288
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,239
functional glass and I guess a lot of

1289
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,318
these artists had never done functional

1290
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:07,000
glass because there wasn't really yeah a

1291
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:10,639
place to do it for them in Japan at the

1292
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,119
time and uh yeah it was like this crazy

1293
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:16,798
piece but you know it was at the same

1294
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:20,000
treat yourself they had a glass

1295
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:22,199
Leatherface dab rig that you could wear

1296
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,358
as a mask but it was oh my God but it it

1297
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,919
was glass yeah it was glass it was like

1298
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:31,440
$20,000 $17,000

1299
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,720
trap trophies yeah yeah fck dude I

1300
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,838
wonder where that market well obviously

1301
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,078
I know where that Market's gone but it's

1302
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:40,960
it's tanked so hard like because there's

1303
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:43,599
not all this expendable money you know

1304
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,079
from seed dudes and and flower dudes

1305
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,480
like just buying up glass just because

1306
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,519
you know you could always move it IRS

1307
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,960
isn't G to come take your piece you know

1308
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,000
so yeah it's it's it's a definitely a

1309
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,679
dying art form and and the Market's

1310
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,400
tanked quite hard yeah I feel like

1311
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:04,399
looking at younger people now like the

1312
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:07,720
pens are the main consumption thing yeah

1313
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,559
yeah totally it's so weird too because

1314
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:12,519
well I guess that's where the education

1315
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,359
comes in but just like people be like I

1316
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,679
don't know why I'm getting headaches

1317
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,838
from this and then you're like try their

1318
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,239
pen you're like yeah I can tell you why

1319
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:22,519
yeah I can name any number of reasons

1320
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:25,199
why there st's not meant to be smoked

1321
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:27,798
together well so I'm gonna wrap it up

1322
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:30,078
we're almost at two hours yeah I told

1323
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:31,119
you I Ram no dude this is amazing I

1324
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,480

we should we should it needs to happen

1330
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,920
yeah it does feel like uh well actually

1331
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,160
you go to the punk rock museum you can

1332
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:55,000
see Joe strummer's last stash they

1333
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:57,239
that's wild yeah he gave it to the guy

1334
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,719
from the poges just before

1335
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:02,000
he went in the hospital and then passed

1336
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,719
away yeah so they have that preserved on

1337
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,798
display so I still haven't gone there

1338
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:10,199
yet it's cool there's some like real uh

1339
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:12,119
real interesting stuff in there there's

1340
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:13,598
like that's the thing about Punk right

1341
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:17,079
everyone's definition of it's so

1342
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:19,599
personal and there's a lot of stuff that

1343
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:22,359
I would like to see in a punk Museum

1344
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,880
that I'm sure doesn't necessarily

1345
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:26,639
reflect the opinions of the people that

1346
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,240
run it and even then there's like five

1347
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,400
or six or however many people on that

1348
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:33,639
committee yeah of people running It

1349
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,119
ultimately headed by Fat Mike that are

1350
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:36,719
yeah probably all pulling in different

1351
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,798
directions too with the history of this

1352
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:44,078

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,920
weird psychedelic because I you don't

1437
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:48,480

1438
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,720
time I'm like I'm high I'm in a room

1439
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,599
full of people watching me but this

1440
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,078

1445
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:08,639
Windor McKay uh cartoons from way back

1446
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,318

1447
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,000
are the elves that you'll see work in

1448

the workshop right and they're working

1449
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,920
on a giant machine that looks like out a

1450
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,480
Fritz Langs Metropolis like that machine

1451
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,720
thing they're working on but it's

1452
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,119
printing out a very distinct black and

1453
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:24,078
white geometric pattern and then one of

1454
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:26,680
them tears off this geometric pattern

1455
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:29,119
sheet that it prints and comes up and is

1456

on tour with us a couple years ago so I

1510
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:21,318

1511
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:24,439

1515
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:31,720
look and I realize it's Johnny Depp he's

1516
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:34,879
got face paint on but it's 100% Johnny

1517
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:37,639
Depp under this face paint and I'm like

1518
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,280
uh and I don't want to say like you know

1519
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:42,719
hands or anything so but I read in spin

1520
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,839
or maybe it was details no it was spin

1521
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,000
way back when that at a Florida Punk

1522
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:48,759
reunion show that he had gotten up and

1523
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,159
played some songs with his old punk band

1524
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,000
and they called the fast cars which

1525
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,318
bother me because it was the Manchester

1526
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,119
band so it always like stuck out to me

1527
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:57,920
so I'm like did you play in a punk band

1528
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:59,920
back in the day called the fast cars

1529
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,280
he's like no man we were called the zc

1530
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,920
cars and I'm like oh are you in a punk

1531
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,000
he's like Florida Punk is my [ __ ] so we

1532
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,559
just start trading bands back and forth

1533
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,880
and like he's like you know this band

1534
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,440
I'm like yeah what about this band he's

1535
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,039
like oh yeah and he goes do you know the

1536
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,639
screaming sneakers and the day before my

1537
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,640
friend in Melbourne had given me a

1538
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:21,400
bootleg that he had done of the

1539
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,598
screaming sneakers 12 inches a seven

1540
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,400
inch that he had just gotten back from

1541
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:26,400
the pressing plane and I had it in my

1542
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,880
napsack and I'm like you mean this band

1543
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,440
and Johnny Depp looks at it it's like

1544
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,160
this Rose Bud moment where he's like

1545
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,480
starts crying and he's like she's so

1546
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:35,038
beautiful like I haven't seen her in

1547
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,280
years because it's his ex-girlfriend on

1548
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,000
the cover of the record oh wow and so

1549
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,559
he's just like looking at it and then he

1550
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,798
just starts talking to me this is like

1551
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:46,319
years and years ago now like and his uh

1552
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,759
this guy comes up to him who he's there

1553
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,679
with and he's like hey John we gotta go

1554
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,319

1555
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,399

1556
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:55,000

1557
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,440
joint or gave me another joint and then

1558
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,679
rolled his weed up in his pants an leg

1559
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,240
and like walked off into the sunset and

1560
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,279
I'm like that's so [ __ ] weird and I

1561
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:05,759
was telling that story years later I

1562
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,039
think to Davey Havoc when Davey Havoc

1563
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,520
was on the podcast and I'm like yeah and

1564
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,720
this manager came over to him and said

1565
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,920
John go set and he's like oh did this

1566
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,038
guy look like blah blah blah and I'm

1567
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,880
like yeah yeah he's like oh that's not

1568
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:18,039
his manager that's my landlord who's

1569
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,519
who's like John's best friend that's so

1570
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:22,920
weird [ __ ] Johnny Depp kicking it in

1571
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:23,880
makeup it was the weirdest [ __ ] I guess

1572
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,318
they were filming Pirates of the

1573
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,119
Caribbean 3 and he was going back said

1574
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:31,719
afterwards and just kind of popped over

1575
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:33,960
in between takes but that's a trip yeah

1576
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,159
that's my DMT trip yeah that would be a

1577
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,199
[ __ ] up DMT trip ending up with Johnny

1578
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:41,598
Depp it made me a Believer I believe in

1579
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:43,639
the power of the uh the god molecule oh

1580
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,359
maybe if it doesn't ego destroy I can do

1581
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:48,480
it yeah this that was the part of it

1582
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:51,000
that I found most intriguing is the fact

1583
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:55,760
that there was

1584
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:58,440
no freak out component to it maybe cross

1585
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,839
yeah no same that's why I like acid more

1586
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,838
than mushrooms because I think mushrooms

1587
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:05,159
same same yeah mushrooms are like yeah

1588
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:07,159
acid's way less wild for me than like

1589
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:09,239
eating [ __ ] you know a half ounce of

1590
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:11,759
mushrooms because I got to do it right

1591
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:15,000
right like just eat a few I was talking

1592
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,680
to a a a mother to day at our school

1593
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,639
Gathering who's a uh a psychedelic

1594
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,798
therapist and she does like mushroom

1595
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:24,719
therapy and she's like yeah the

1596
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:27,838
therapeutic dose is seven grams and I'm

1597
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,838
like who the [ __ ] does seven grams as

1598
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,199
their first dose of

1599
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,759
mushrooms and my wife my wife's like

1600
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:35,759
what that's not I'm like I feel it after

1601
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,960
a gram and a half yeah yeah that's kind

1602
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,119
of a lot for a first uh first go could

1603
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,639
imagine what that would be like she's

1604
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,599
like yeah know it's that's what we do is

1605
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:47,838
like seven to 10 is a therapeutic

1606
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:48,680
dose like and it's so counter to what

1607
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,358
the

1608
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:52,719
Cannabis uh guidelines are for dosing

1609
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:56,598
with cannabis where they're like okay

1610
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:58,318
five grams to start off DC it's like no

1611
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,039
we're gonna start you off 10 grams get

1612
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,119
in the [ __ ] pool and swim kid good

1613
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,599
luck like I was always like I would

1614
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,358
never want to do it with a trip guide

1615
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,920
but if I'm having to take seven grams of

1616
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:12,639
mushrooms I would I need a life raft I

1617
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,639
need like several trip guides I

1618
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,599
need yeah it's it's cool that's the cool

1619
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,038
thing about our school though there's

1620
