1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,240
a little rough from time to time so if i

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,480
offend i do apologize

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,480
but unfortunately that's the way i am

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,960
first of all before i begin i would like

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,559
to thank

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
very much

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,479
mr john lear for making it possible for

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,480
me to be here at this conference

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,079
i did not know whether or not i would be

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,039
able to make it and john made that

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,479
possible and he has my deepest gratitude

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,879
because i've been looking forward for an

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,439
opportunity like this for almost 10

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,440
years now

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,919
and also i'd like to thank the other

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,920
speakers who very graciously donated

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
some of their time to allow me to speak

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,759
i have 45 minutes and in 45 minutes i

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,599
have to condense 12 years

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,439
of information

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,480
and happenings

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,479
what i would like to do

23
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,039
is speak for 30 minutes and then for 15

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,799
minutes except questions from the floor

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
and i'd like to make a promise to you at

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
this point

27
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,759
that unlike certain people

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,239
i will not try to treat you like

29
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,639
mushrooms by keeping you in the dark and

30
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,640
feeding you

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
and that

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,759
and that during the question and answer

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,239
period

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,879
i will not ask myself questions and

35
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,879
answer them for

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,399
you give you a little background about

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,118
myself in 1976 while working for the

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,920
united states government

39
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:53,359
at raf chick sands u.s air force base

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,599
security services command

41
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,438
in bedford england as a data analyst

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,759
i had the occasion to view a document

43
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,839
entitled grudge blue book report number

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,200
13.

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,118
those of you who are aware of the

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,199
history of blue book

47
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,199
no the grudge blue book or blue book

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,719
report number 13

49
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,039
is a document

50
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,598
that the government has sworn for years

51
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,959
does not exist

52
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,878
well i'm here to tell you ladies and

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,598
gentlemen that's crap

54
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,039
it does exist

55
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,679
while employed by the government

56
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,079
fulfilling my duties

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,519
i analyze that document

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
i read it very carefully

59
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,839
over 600 pages over half of that was

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
photographs

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,759
the content of that document consisted

62
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,719
largely

63
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,280
of technical reports

64
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,280
autopsy reports

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,919
and photographs

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,039
of alien beings

67
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,039
alien technology

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
and on sunday other things

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,759
which i will get into

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
and at this point i would like to make

71
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,199
mention that i find myself in a very

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,519
very poor position

73
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,199
which i am not entirely happy with

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,879
because i'm being forced to do something

75
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,878
i swore up and down i would never do

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
and that is respond to last night's

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,919
speaker mr bill moore

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,719
and i will do that after i give you a

79
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,719
brief rundown of the blue book 13 report

80
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,120
the version of the document that i saw

81
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,878
was an annotated version

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,759
mr cooper saw his version of the

83
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,560
document in the early 70s

84
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,798
i saw my version of the same document

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
in the mid 70s

86
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,000
my version of the document had been

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
expanded considerably

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,760
a large portion of the document

89
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,759
consisted largely of photographs

90
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,958
photographs which

91
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,479
showed alien beings

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,479
alive and dead

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,799
micro photography photographs of tissue

94
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,479
samples

95
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,358
lab reports of fluid samples

96
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,199
analytical data from the findings of

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,240
tests

98
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,478
technical data concerning craft

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,199
power units

100
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,839
and possibly weapons

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,840
the general tone of the document itself

102
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,599
was geared basically toward defense

103
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,198
how would we defend against something

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
like this

105
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
how would we defend against the

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,879
technology

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,478
that was obvious and that was shown and

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,478
reported upon in the document

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
now

110
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,599
for the past 12 years

111
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,599
eight of which i was in hiding

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,080
i have been called a liar

113
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,439
i have been called a drug addict

114
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,159
a pervert

115
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,038
a psychotic you name it and i've been

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
called it according to some i am

117
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,399
probably the most perverted son of the

118
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,400
you will meet in the entire world

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
and that's fine

120
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,600
after 12 years i've become a little bit

121
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,879
hard shelled about the whole thing

122
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,879
and i don't particularly care

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
but there's something we have to

124
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,800
understand as a group of investigators

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,039
as a group of interested people

126
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,759
we have to cut through the crap

127
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,000
we have to pull together

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
as a unified force and forget

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,879
personalities

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
forget character assassination

131
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,639
forget all of the politics

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
that exist within organizations

133
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,600
and unite

134
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:02,000
in order to find the answers that we

135
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,639
need to find

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,279
we have to do this

137
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
it's imperative

138
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,478
part of our problem right now is we

139
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,478
don't even know what the questions are

140
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
we have to cooperate with one another

141
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,560
many of you have read john lear's

142
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,879
interview with me in virginia of last

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
year

144
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,478
in which he outlined much of what i've

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,160
been saying for the past 12 years

146
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,758
i would suggest that you get a copy of

147
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
this if you do not have it and read it

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
simple fact of the matter is is i can't

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
tell you any more that has already been

150
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,560
published in things like ufo crash at

151
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,439
aztec by bill steinman and wendell

152
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,680
stevens

153
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,120
or what has been published by john lear

154
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,038
it's all there

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
and most of you i'm sure have touched

156
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,199
upon the report or read the report on

157
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,199
what was in the report

158
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,959
unfortunately

159
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,720
i'm faced with a dilemma at this point

160
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,719
and that dilemma is this

161
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,759
i came here last night to listen to mr

162
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,759
moore

163
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,758
and i came here with the idea

164
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,680
of being open-minded as i possibly could

165
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,560
understanding that people are entitled

166
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:35,519
to their own opinion their own feeling

167
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,519
for whatever reason

168
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,519
but there's a part of me that objects

169
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
very strongly

170
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
to being lied to

171
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
and that's exactly what happened last

172
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,878
night

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
you were lied to

174
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,279
we sat up here in the audience and

175
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,960
listened to a man expound on stuff

176
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,959
that was absolute utter hogwash

177
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,360
now some of you are sitting out there

178
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,840
saying how can this be true

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,879
why is it hogwash he's a respected

180
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,119
investigator he's been in the business

181
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,439
for a long time he's published a book

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,079
he's published a couple of books

183
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,079
yes he has

184
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,598
his roswell incidents that new

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,400
presidents for investigation in the ufo

186
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,800
field

187
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,918
and he's to be commended for it i admire

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,598
him for it

189
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,278
it's an excellent book

190
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,080
he broke new ground for ufo

191
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,080
investigators

192
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,799
what happened after that i don't know

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,039
you heard mr moore stand up here and say

194
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,039
in 1980 or 1981

195
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,679
he was approached and given information

196
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,120
by

197
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,079
falcon or condor or whatever the

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
buzzard's name was

199
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,720
that was a lie

200
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,958
it was an absolute lie

201
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,519
and i know it was alive because in 1979

202
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,759
one month after mr moore arrived in the

203
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,080
state of arizona

204
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:27,838
thanks to mr alan benz formerly of apro

205
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,800
now for the foundation of ufo research

206
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
mr moore and i met

207
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,000
at which point i related my information

208
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,000
to mr moore

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
we met not once but twice

210
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,958
seven months later mr moore came to me

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,958
my place of business

212
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,679
a little place called trail dust town

213
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,360
off tanker verde road in tucson arizona

214
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,439
we went across the street to a little

215
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,200
place called the parfait palace

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
i had a bowl of chili he had a cup of

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
coffee

218
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,838
i had heartburn

219
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,838
and he had brain burn

220
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:15,359
mr moore sat there for two hours and we

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,559
conversed we discussed

222
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
what i had

223
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,078
related to him to begin with in the blue

224
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
book documents

225
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,439
and i think ostensibly what he was

226
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,039
trying to do was to see if he could

227
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
catch me at a lie

228
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,159
see if i would tell him the same thing i

229
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,399
told him before

230
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,958
which is fine any good investigator

231
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,679
would do that

232
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,719
but somewhere along the line mr moore

233
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,719
twisted it around

234
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,359
at that time i had been discussing with

235
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,078
mr jerry schultz

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
who had been passing through afro and

237
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,078
apparently had been passing through

238
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,320
april for several years at that point

239
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,319
with his bicycle and his little pup tent

240
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,639
some of the implications of what had

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
been going on

242
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,480
quite literally whenever i was in the

243
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,078
afro office mr schultz was in the opera

244
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
office and he grilled me extensively

245
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,879
mr moore asked my opinion of mr schultz

246
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,838
at that time being fairly conservative

247
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,838
and not as liberal as i am these days

248
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,040
i expressed the opinion that i thought

249
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,559
mr schultz was a bit different

250
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,958
mr moore brought up the question of

251
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,199
drugs

252
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,799
to which i responded i don't know it's

253
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
possible

254
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,278
anything's possible

255
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,360
i did not know the man well

256
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,439
i never did know the man well contrary

257
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
to what you might have heard

258
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,959
from mr schultz himself we were never

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,919
close

260
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,919
never have been close

261
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
very shortly after that due to

262
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
circumstances which

263
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,320
got a little bit out of control with

264
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,078
regard to my activity and investigation

265
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,079
and the fact that very suddenly there

266
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,078
were serious attempts against my life

267
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,759
it became appropriate for me to

268
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,759
disappear

269
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,320
at which point i went into hiding for

270
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
eight years

271
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,759
yesterday marked the first anniversary

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,959
of me resurfacing into the ufo

273
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,958
investigative community

274
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,639
today

275
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
marks the 13th anniversary

276
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,759
of my viewing of the grudge blue book

277
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,039
report number 13.

278
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,200
13 years ago today in 1976

279
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:53,639
i viewed that document

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,639
and my life went to hell in a handcart

281
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,519
as a result of viewing that document

282
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
as i digress a little bit

283
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:10,000
i lost a wife and two kids

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
i reported to work as i normally do

285
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,800
at security services command

286
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,559
at aria of chick sands

287
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,479
i was immediately told to report to the

288
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,559
base commander's office

289
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,200
on base

290
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,199
which i did

291
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,839
where i met colonel robert black

292
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,838
thin base commander at raf chick sands

293
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,600
colonel black called me into his office

294
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
and informed me that i was being

295
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,278
discharged from my job

296
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,799
and that i was being deported from the

297
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,159
country

298
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,159
as undesirable element

299
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,519
no explanation

300
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,519
no reason

301
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,079
that was it

302
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,759
it took me several months after my

303
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,479
return to the united states to finally

304
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,240
determine what had happened

305
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,159
i was not allowed to say goodbye to my

306
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
wife or children who remained in england

307
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,559
who remained at ra of chick's hands for

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,759
another five years where she taught

309
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,599
school

310
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,600
at the raf check sands dependent school

311
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,759
i have not seen my wife and sons in 12

312
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
years

313
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,759
i have not heard from them in two years

314
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,120
i have discovered ultimately that she

315
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,519
was transferred to another air force

316
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
base in england where she teaches school

317
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
still

318
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,639
i was not allowed to communicate with

319
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,319
her in any way shape or form i was not

320
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,720
allowed to tell her what was going on

321
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,480
why it was going on

322
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
i did discover later that she had been

323
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,440
told that i just walked in and quit and

324
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
left the country

325
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
and left her

326
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,399
it's not true

327
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,839
excuse me

328
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
it's not true

329
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,000
but that's what she was told

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,159
and any woman in her right mind who's

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
left high and dry with two kids to take

332
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,958
care of

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,159
is going to think the worst

334
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,159
and that's understandable

335
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,078
ultimately after about 10 years i

336
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,078
divorced my wife

337
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,078
feeling that there was no way i could

338
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,079
possibly salvage a marriage

339
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,078
and then after such a long separation

340
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,440
she had changed and i had changed

341
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,000
and i decided it was time to get on with

342
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
my life

343
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,480
ultimately two years ago i married a

344
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,439
very wonderful lady

345
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,440
with two kids of her own

346
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,838
i'm quite happy

347
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,679
and it looks like this marriage will

348
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,039
last a long time i hope it will

349
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,399
because she's about the only person i

350
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,078
know that can put up with my shenanigans

351
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,919
she deserves a lot of credit and i'd

352
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,679
like you to know

353
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,039
that she supports me and i wouldn't be

354
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,278
able to do what i'm doing today without

355
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,278
her support

356
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,360
during the last 12 years

357
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
there have been over 15 attempts on my

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,199
life

359
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,879
i have been shot at

360
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,838
i've been stabbed

361
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,838
i've been blown up

362
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,039
i've contracted food poisoning

363
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,240
all the little things that are geared to

364
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,240
look like nice little accidents

365
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
now some of you will say well if you

366
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,719
were in such a secure position while you

367
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
were hiding why did you come back out

368
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,160
i was employed at a radio station in

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,160
lynchburg virginia wlva stereo59

370
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
by this time john lear

371
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
had tried to contact my father

372
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
my father is william j english speaker

373
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
of the house of representatives for the

374
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,959
state of arizona

375
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,720
my father being somewhat aware of my

376
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,600
desire to maintain my anonymity

377
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,360
denied my existence to john

378
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:41,119
had his secretary deny my existence

379
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,119
and john bless's heart persisted

380
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,558
persisted to the point where my father

381
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
secretary

382
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,160
was so worked up and so upset my father

383
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,919
decided to forward john's phone number

384
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,919
and a terse little note saying that he

385
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
did not tell john where i was at or how

386
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,280
to get in contact with me and i demo

387
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,159
better take care of it because he was

388
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,160
getting tired of it

389
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,759
i learned a long time ago it's not wise

390
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,599
to cross my father

391
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,599
he has a nasty habit of getting what he

392
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,599
wants

393
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,038
but i didn't respond to it immediately

394
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,678
for two reasons

395
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,160
one i did not know john lear

396
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,160
and two

397
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,679
i really didn't feel

398
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:33,038
that it was necessary at that point for

399
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,038
me to come out of the closet

400
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,160
and announce that the rumors of my

401
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,320
demise

402
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,320
were exaggerated

403
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:44,720
[Music]

404
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
at this point

405
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,000
i would like to take the opportunity i

406
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,440
don't know if mr anders is here but i

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,759
would like to take the opportunity to

408
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,200
thank mr andrews

409
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,279
because mr andrews is directly

410
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,840
responsible for me contacting wendell

411
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,839
stevens

412
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,119
mr andrews made a statement

413
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,120
to abc news i believe it was

414
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,440
the statement was so out of character

415
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,439
for what i knew from walt anders

416
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,360
but i had to consider it very carefully

417
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,558
while working at the radio station i had

418
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,159
the opportunity to view the pre-feeds

419
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,759
that network sends down to radio

420
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,519
stations so that you'll have an idea of

421
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,200
what is going to come down the network

422
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,038
news

423
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,279
in that statement mr andrews said that

424
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,679
there are aliens on earth that we have

425
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,960
been invaded

426
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,559
and that they are here

427
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,000
i found this extremely out of character

428
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,000
for what i knew of mr anders

429
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,558
it was not the conservative person that

430
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,000
i had known

431
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,839
certainly wasn't the person that had

432
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,759
been described to me by coral lorenzen

433
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,798
which i might add at that time was not

434
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,798
complementary at all

435
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,120
but shortly thereafter i was on coral's

436
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
list also so it didn't matter much

437
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,919
and i knew that i had made it wherever

438
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:13,279
made it was because i was at the top of

439
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,038
her list of people to avoid and to hate

440
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,119
i might add at this point i have the

441
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:21,200
dubious honor of being the only person

442
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:23,678
that coral has tried to sue

443
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,080
when coral did that

444
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,280
i knew then and there

445
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,279
that i had reached the top

446
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,839
but i will say this if coral and jim

447
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,839
lorenzen they have my

448
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,480
honor

449
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,719
they have my admiration whatever my

450
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,599
personal feelings about jim and carl

451
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,240
lorenzon might be

452
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,079
they had the courage to do something

453
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,798
that nobody else did and they were the

454
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,798
very first

455
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,840
their work

456
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,559
made it possible

457
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,480
for all of you to be here today

458
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,480
and for that i am eternally grateful

459
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,880
[Applause]

460
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,679
to continue and i apologize for

461
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:21,038
digressing and going off into tangents

462
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,038
but that's the way i am

463
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,440
i read the statement that mr andrews had

464
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,319
made on the wire service

465
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,320
i said this can't be right

466
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,400
i don't believe this

467
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,200
after so many years

468
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,918
somebody

469
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,919
of repute

470
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,839
came forward and said yes it's true

471
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,200
and it was like a load was lifted off my

472
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
back

473
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,240
that very night i contacted wendell

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,200
stevens and said wendell

475
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,159
he said yes

476
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,159
who the hell are you

477
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,679
bill english

478
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,480


479
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,640
not really it's bill english wendell

480
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,159
where the hell are you

481
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
i'm in virginia

482
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,600
virginia

483
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,439
i heard you were dead we thought you

484
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,439
were dead where have you been

485
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,639
so i re-asked the scenario with wendell

486
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,919
wendell being

487
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,840
a little bit more aware of what the

488
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,038
circumstances were at the time and why i

489
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,599
disappeared

490
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:39,720
could understand it

491
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,719
he told me you know you're in a book

492
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
which i responded no

493
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,960
said yeah fella by the name of bill

494
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,000
steinman and i wrote a book

495
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
well i helped him

496
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,600
no kidding

497
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,158
how do i get a copy of the book

498
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,558
well i'll send you one

499
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,840
say can i tell anybody that you're uh

500
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,678
you're still there

501
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,319
hell no

502
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,759
i don't want anybody to know i'm here

503
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,439
send me the book and i'll talk to you

504
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,200
several days later i received the book

505
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,200
in the mail and i sat down and read it

506
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,918
and i was greatly disturbed at what i

507
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,919
read

508
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,599
not because what was in the book was a

509
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,639
lie it wasn't the information that was

510
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,918
in the book was extremely accurate

511
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,759
wendell had very faithfully seen to it

512
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,759
that all the information was there

513
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,480
i was disturbed because after so many

514
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
years i was forced to sit down

515
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,558
and remember

516
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,000
the circumstances

517
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,000
that brought me to that point in my life

518
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,918
i then sat down with my wife

519
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,919
and said valerie i want you to read this

520
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,919
this is who i am this is what i'm about

521
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,839
it's finally come out in the open

522
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,599
she read it

523
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
she said is it true

524
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,319
i said yes

525
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,038
then she said what are you going to do

526
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,200
about it what are we going to do about

527
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,200
it

528
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,320
i said well

529
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,319
what should we do about it i don't know

530
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,480
i said well boy you better get off your

531
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,079
ass and get out there and start talking

532
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,440
about it because it's obvious somebody

533
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,278
out there knows what's going on and

534
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,840
they'd better get the straight

535
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,839
information

536
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,839
when she said that i fell in love with

537
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
that lady all over again

538
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,000
she had more courage than i did

539
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,038
either that or she was extremely naive

540
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,119
but i like to think she was courageous

541
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,599
so after reading the book and going

542
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,400
through all that i finally contacted

543
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,558
john lear

544
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,679
first time i contacted him i posed as

545
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,678
bill english's lawyer

546
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,798
called him up and said i'm mr english's

547
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
lawyer legal attorney he told me to

548
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,359
contact you and find out what the hell

549
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,640
you want

550
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,240
john told

551
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,919
the lawyer

552
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,679
what he wanted

553
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,080
he was very honest very straightforward

554
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
about it

555
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,839
i thanked him hung up

556
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,760
and then i didn't call him back for

557
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,038
about two weeks

558
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,480
well i considered everything

559
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,319
finally at the end of two weeks i called

560
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,519
them back

561
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,519
we talked for a few minutes

562
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,959
he asked if he could meet me in virginia

563
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,959
and i said yes please do

564
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,519
had a great inconvenience to him and at

565
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,079
much expense

566
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:15,918
he flew to virginia to meet me

567
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,918
where i met him at the lynchburg airport

568
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,000
immediately upon his arrival for the

569
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,640
first time in

570
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,759
eight years

571
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,278
we were followed

572
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,278
the government knew where i was at

573
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,799
john came into the airport terminal i

574
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,559
was wearing a beard old levi's

575
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,720
the blue vest that many of you have seen

576
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,599
me walking around here in the last few

577
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
days

578
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,399
my lucky vest

579
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,919
he sat down he had no idea what i looked

580
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,559
like i sat down next to him waited for a

581
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,759
couple of minutes

582
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,399
turned around and looked at him and said

583
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,000
you can buy me a drink let's go

584
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,080
and john being the trooper and he is

585
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
didn't say a word

586
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,079
got up grabbed his bag walked out the

587
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,480
door

588
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,240
trails followed us out the door

589
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,519
we jumped in john's car and headed to a

590
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,720
local bar

591
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,720
where john bought me a drink

592
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,798
two gentlemen followed us into the bar

593
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,918
john and i scooted out of the bar

594
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,918
and headed for my home

595
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,239
the next few days

596
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,960
john

597
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,918
very graciously but very thoroughly

598
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,919
grilled me

599
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,038
reminded me of things that i had not

600
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,038
remembered for many years

601
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,599
my chief concern when i spoke to mr lear

602
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,879
was i did not know him and i did not

603
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,639
want to come off as an idiot

604
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,440
i did not want him to think that i was

605
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,440
another nut case

606
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,599
it wasn't until about a month later when

607
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,440
mr lear sent me a copy of his report on

608
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,000
meeting with me

609
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,840
that i finally had an idea of what he

610
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,919
thought of

611
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,798
me and i was deeply gratified to see

612
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,799
that he believed me

613
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,440
mr lear is officially retiring from

614
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,439
active ufo investigations

615
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,038
and i cry for it

616
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,199
objectively he has not been in the field

617
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,359
for very long but what he has done has

618
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,360
been phenomenal

619
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,678
mr lear

620
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,038
is perhaps

621
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,038
one of the finest men i know

622
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,720
whatever else you might think of him as

623
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,679
an investigator

624
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,640
as a controversial figure

625
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,640
as a human being

626
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,319
the man

627
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,398
has heart

628
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,929
and there's damn few of us anymore that

629
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:23,278
can say that about anybody

630
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:27,840
[Applause]

631
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,839
now that i've covered for the most part

632
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,960
what i've had to say with review regard

633
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:36,319
to reviewing some of the circumstances

634
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,319
which have brought me here tonight

635
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,240
it's now necessary for me to address the

636
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,240
question of mr moore

637
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,200
last night mr moore stood up here and

638
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,879
said we must stop the character

639
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,919
assassination

640
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,039
we must stop the infighting we must stop

641
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,038
the disinformation

642
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,639
and as he was saying that i was walking

643
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,798
around the back of this auditorium

644
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,559
about ready to pop a court because the

645
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,798
man was standing there

646
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,240
telling you a bald-faced lie

647
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,158
yeah

648
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,679
[Applause]

649
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,240
he has not stopped the character

650
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,840
assassination and he never did

651
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,519
nine months ago

652
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,398
when mr moore discovered that i had

653
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,398
resurfaced

654
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,640
he was asked by two engineers from

655
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,640
aerojet corporation

656
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,319
what he thought of me and my viewing of

657
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,200
the documents that i said i had viewed

658
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,519
to which he responded

659
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,840
bill english told me that he and jerry

660
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,839
schultz were doing lsd

661
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,839
when they wrote the blue book summation

662
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,919
this is a documented fact bill did in

663
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,000
fact say this and i have a letter from

664
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,240
him stating that he said it and i have

665
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,240
that letter here today

666
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,919
it's in the posses possession of mr john

667
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
lear because i gave it to him yesterday

668
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,240
morning

669
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,519
that statement is an out and out lie

670
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
i never made such a statement to mr

671
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,679
moore

672
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,519
in fact i do not do drugs

673
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,278
i have a hard time taking drugs even

674
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,278
those are prescribed by the doctor

675
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,440
i said nothing at that point because i

676
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,079
wanted to wait and see what else was

677
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,080
going to happen

678
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:44,720
then mr moore came out with that fukaka

679
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,398
ufo television show of his

680
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,000
which in my estimation was designed to

681
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:53,359
do nothing more than discredit

682
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,720
the science of ufology

683
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,719
and that's exactly what it did

684
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,839
it was poorly produced

685
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,840
poorly written

686
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:09,278
and it made ufo investigators look like

687
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,278
absolute utter idiots

688
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,840
and it was the cruelest blow that

689
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,079
anybody could have hit ufo investigators

690
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,079
with

691
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,720
dad insult to injury

692
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,200
mr moore

693
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,759
had his two buzzards

694
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,759
pronounce

695
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,798
the stuff

696
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:39,678
that he said i'd been lying about

697
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,679
for 13 years

698
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,640
word for word they parroted everything

699
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,639
that i had told him in 1979.

700
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,599
one hour after viewing this travesty i

701
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,359
got on the telephone to allen benz and

702
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,839
got mr morris phone number

703
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,079
alan is here tonight he will confirm

704
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,079
this

705
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,720
bill was in washington d.c

706
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,720
i spoke with mr chandra

707
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,639
i told mr chandra

708
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,240
that i wanted a piece of mr amore's ass

709
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,360
so bad i was ready to crawl through the

710
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,359
phone and bite him on the air

711
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,960
i told mr chandra that that show was

712
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,959


713
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,240
that a man who for 12 years had said

714
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,759
that bill english is a liar and a drug

715
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,519
addict

716
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,200
and a paranoid schizophrenic and every

717
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,759
kind of perverse son of a that you

718
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,759
can imagine

719
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,080
produced a television show

720
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,519
that parroted everything that i had been

721
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,558
saying

722
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,558
for 12 years

723
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,200
my question at that time was if i'm such

724
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,119
a liar

725
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,878
why would you produce a piece of crap

726
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,878
like this and have someone say that

727
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,719
my question now is

728
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,039
after producing that piece of

729
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,599
why would you stand in front of an

730
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,039
audience of qualified intelligent people

731
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,399
and tell them that it was a

732
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,398
disinformation ploy

733
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,320
another lie

734
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,358
quite frankly

735
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,759
if mr moore is not in this for the money

736
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,679
then what the hell is he in it for

737
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,200
he's not done any good for ufo

738
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,200
investigation that i can determine

739
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,159
except heard it

740
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,559
i would like to take this opportunity

741
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,759
right now to apologize to you and to

742
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,719
those of you

743
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,760
who support mr moore

744
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,759
but facts are facts

745
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,119
whatever you may think of me

746
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,640
tomorrow morning i will get up and wash

747
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,760
my face and go to the bathroom and put

748
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:27,480
my pants on just like most of you do

749
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,480
i will be here tomorrow

750
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,359
many of you came to this meeting today

751
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,800
saying

752
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,799
we are going to get some answers

753
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,000
and i apologize to you because i don't

754
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,599
have any answers for you

755
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,838
i don't even know what the questions are

756
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,838
anymore

757
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
i do know

758
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,039
that we as a body

759
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,320
must pull together

760
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,719
not only in muthons

761
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,640
but in kufos

762
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,639
center for international ufo studies

763
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,960
all

764
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,240
of the ufo organizations

765
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,160
that are in existence today

766
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,679
must put aside their political

767
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,440
aspirations

768
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,358
must put aside the politics of their

769
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,720
organization

770
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,719
must put aside their personal feelings

771
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,039
we must

772
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,920
it's imperative if we're going to

773
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,920
accomplish anything

774
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,119
it has long been my central repository

775
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,119
of records and information

776
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,719
do it in such a manner that all

777
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,079
organizations

778
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,078
can access the information

779
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,440
thanks to a gentleman by the name of mr

780

richard scheffler out of alamogordo new

mexico that dream has come true

782

783
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,679
established a computerized news and

787
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,480
the information that goes into this

788
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:23,119
board will be approved by a board

789

consisting of several investigators of

791
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,079
renown

792
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,000

agree with each other

many of the members of this board hate

each other's guts

800
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,599
we don't care

whatever your opinions and personal

802
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,240

of checking over whatever information is

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,720
submitted to the euphenet bulletin board

808

investigative technique

we do not editorialize

811
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,400
whatever is submitted will be put on the

computer

813
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,119
exactly as it was submitted

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,280
there will be no deletions

815
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,599
there will be no editorial comment added

nothing

00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,400
what you see

819
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,400
will be the original document

820
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,039
it is my hope

821
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,078
that we as an organization

822
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:50,719
of human beings

823
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,839
can gather together

824
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,838
and use this service

825
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,799
to find the disinformation

826
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,838
to make a determination as to what is

827
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
true or not true

828
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,599
employ scientific technique

829
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,799
in the investigation of ufos

830
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,079
and establish a firmer

831
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,079
more solid foundation

832
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,240
this science of ours

833
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,280
and that's exactly what this is

834
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,279
this is a science

835
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,440
we have no established criteria per se

836
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,039
for investigators

837
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,000
but we hope eventually that will take

838
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,079
place

839
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and that ufology will be recognized as a

840
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,200
genuine

841
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,199

marilyn monroe

861
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,039
a little joke there for liberty to be

862
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,039
perfectly honest with you the only thing

863
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,679
i know about the philadelphia experiment

864
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,400
is what i saw in the movie

865
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,318
i cannot give you a qualified opinion

866
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,680
about the book

867
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,519
and what was the rest of your question

868
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,519
well i was wondering in connection with

869
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,519
that about the mystery connected with

870
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,839
einstein's involvement with the

871
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,400
philadelphia

872
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:10,480
experiment and the rumors

873
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,318
about

874
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,400
marilyn monroe being not only beautiful

875
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:18,000
but intelligent and her connection with

876
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,318
the kennedys and why jackie kennedy

877
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,639
kept quiet about everything could was

878
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,559
she also perhaps in fear for her life

879
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,480
my dear lady you are asking me questions

880
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,759
that i have absolutely no knowledge at

881
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,838

882
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,200

886
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,399
circumstances where you uh reviewed this

887
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,039

you were in the service there or no a

890
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,280
little more detail i was a civilian

891
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,279
employee

892
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,720
i was employed by the department of

893
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,720
defense security services command

894
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,680
uh

895
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,520
the document came across my desk in a

896
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,679
diplomatic pouch for the disposition

897
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,199
form instructing me to analyze the

898
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,318
document

899
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:09,838
assign it a probability rate

900
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,838
as to whether or not it was true

901
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,078
whatever

902
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,679
all i did was my job

903
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,440
which was essentially analyzed the

904
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:22,399
document that was presented in my inbox

905
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,480
and write a summation of it

906
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
thank you

907
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,920
yes bill will you discourse at length

908
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,240
about some of the contents of this

909
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
document and just get into it for about

910
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,199
five minutes and tell us some of the

911
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,280
things that you saw

912
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,559
and above all some of your feelings

913
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,319
towards this material what were you

914
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,078
feeling how did it what was it like to

915
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,519
read this and tell us about this

916
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,680
material because

917
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,000
as a ufologist i'm more interested in

918
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,838
the flying saucers than i am about the

919
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,579
petty squabbles between the researchers

920
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:54,239
you know what i mean

921
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:56,000
[Applause]

922
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,838
at the time when i read the document it

923
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
was reported in the document that the

924
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,279
united states had in its possession

925
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,680
several ufos

926
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,359
technological reports showed

927
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,559
that on

928
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,239
a few of them they had been dismantled

929
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,639
there was a photograph of what was

930
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,959
labeled as an atomic generator or a

931
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,920
nuclear power unit which was no bigger

932
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
than a basketball

933
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,519
the inside of the craft

934
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,440
apparently

935
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,559
showed apparently what were control

936
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
boards

937
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,318
with strange writing on them i'm not a

938
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,959
linguist so i couldn't begin to tell you

939
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,960
what it said

940
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,519
uh

941
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,560
there was there was a great deal of

942
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,560
stuff

943
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,480
a lot of things that just

944
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,599
dealt most i was more interested to be

945
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,440
honest with you in the autopsy pictures

946
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:54,000
several of the autopsy pictures showed

947
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,119
alien cadavers on autopsy tables

948
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,960
that had been

949
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,880
vivisectioned

950
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,720
several photographs showed an alien head

951
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,640
which had been removed from the body cut

952
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,480
in half which showed brain casings

953
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,960
some of these photographs were in color

954
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,440
some of them were in black and white

955
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,599
one particular photograph

956
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,039
that i remember distinctly

957
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,960
was that of three aliens shoved up what

958
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,119
shoved up against what appeared to be a

959
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,599
white tile wall

960
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,160
in which

961
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,039
they look very confused and a photograph

962
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,039
of them was taken

963
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,880
i'm sorry

964
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,879
live aliens

965
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,640
does that answer your question yes sir

966
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,880
may uh

967
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:44,078
isn't it true bill that our government

968
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,480
believed for quite some time uh that

969
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,800
these greys boasted that they created

970
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,039
jesus christ

971
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,359
i know i know it's kind of heavy and i

972
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,199
figured i'd drop it on you it is rumored

973
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,598
that this is in fact what has taken

974
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,598
place

975
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,880
it's rumored that because of biogenetic

976
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,880
engineering jesus christ was engineered

977
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,280
by the aliens

978
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,358
quite honestly i have no knowledge of

979
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,560
this

980
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,559
i'm not a theologian

981
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,639
and to be perfectly honest with you that

982
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,639
is a topic that i am afraid to even

983
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,639
approach for the simple fact that it is

984
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,559
so hot i would give you i appreciate

985
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,838
that and thank you

986
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,279
yes sir

987
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,078
yes as a

988
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,760
civilian employee

989
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,680
and privileged to that kind of

990
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,800
information i wonder what it was that

991
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:38,159
led to them flopping that on your desk

992
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,960
and what your direct reaction

993
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,358
to

994
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,800
information about ufos

995
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,440
were did you have any previous

996
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,519
orientation toward ufos or

997
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,358
perfectly frank with you i had no

998
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,358
interest in ufos whatsoever

999
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,720
i had no knowledge of them

1000
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,679
we went into

1001
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,280
we found the aircraft

1002
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,118
we were supposed to bring out survivors

1003
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,200
if there were any

1004
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,079
there were none

1005
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:24,480
at that time i had no concept of ufos

1006
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:27,039
ufology mutilations whatsoever

1007
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,719
we found the entire crew

1008
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,440
still in their safety harnesses and

1009
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,519
their seat in the aircraft

1010
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,200
the aircraft had not crashed it was

1011
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,719
perfectly intact

1012
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,559
the only visible damage that we could

1013
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,318
see was the fact that the engine pods

1014
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,799
were damaged because the aircraft was

1015
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,800
sitting on them

1016
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,440
the crew

1017
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:49,440
had been mutilated

1018
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:56,199
in every classical sense of the word as

1019
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,200
described by linda howell in her book

1020
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,318
of cattle mutilations

1021
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,039
we photographed the bodies

1022
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,800
we grabbed dog tags

1023
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,039
we destroyed the aircraft for the bodies

1024
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,039
in it

1025
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,079
we returned to our assigned base

1026
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,000
the photographs were forwarded to mcphee

1027
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,960
headquarters in saigon

1028
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,199
this is the last i ever saw of them

1029
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,639
until 1976 when they appeared in the

1030
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,159
grudge blue book 13 report

1031
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,118
and i recognized them as being the

1032
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,118
photographs that i took

1033
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:38,399
so i had no doubt whatsoever the uh as

1034
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,318
to the authenticity of the document

1035
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,358
do you think that they knew that handing

1036
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,279
you the

1037
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,358
the file

1038
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,359
for your analysis it's entirely possible

1039
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,079
it's entirely possible

1040
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,880
i could have been set up i don't know

1041
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,039
and then uh beyond that after you did

1042
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,240
analyze it and write your report

1043
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,838
d uh

1044
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,318
i'm unfamiliar with that so i'm just

1045
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:07,039
wondering if if that was what led

1046
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,199
directly to

1047
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,400
your ousting in the service i believe it

1048
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,078
was

1049
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,119
i believe it was

1050
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,880
thank you

1051
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,318
next question please we're running short

1052
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,000
on time i hope you don't feel slighted

1053
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,838
if i cut you off but i'll try and get as

1054
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,440
many in as i can so please make it brief

1055
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:27,920
okay i understand you had uh one day to

1056
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,760
analyze the report

1057
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,519
that's the recollection i have from

1058
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,359
reading about the report

1059
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,679
and um

1060
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,000
uh and it was not until sometime later

1061
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:41,118
that you tried to reproduce the report

1062
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,838
from memory i'm sorry i say again it was

1063
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,280
some time later when you uh tried to

1064
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,279
kind of regenerate the report from

1065
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,400
memory from your

1066
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,720
one day or so

1067
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,318
can you characterize

1068
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,159
uh if you

1069
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,119
think that your recollection of the

1070
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,118
report was

1071
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,679
complete or or

1072
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,519
to to what extent do you think you were

1073
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,358
able to kind of regurgitate what you

1074
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:08,000
actually saw

1075
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,920
initially it was about 95

1076
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,079
after 13 years it's probably a little

1077
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,079
bit less

1078
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,200
that's actually a very high percentage

1079
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,680
is that just

1080
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,679
your talent i have an idyllic memory

1081
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:23,759
okay your wife

1082
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:26,719
you're what i have an idyllic memory

1083
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,440
i did it i did i did it all right yeah

1084
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,439
i got it but i can't say it

1085
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,318
yes sir we were shown a

1086
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,800
videotape narrated by rod serling of the

1087
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:40,400
landing at holloman air force base

1088
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,839
and the aliens faces were described with

1089
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,519
large noses

1090
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,519
and that contradicts most of the

1091
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,119
descriptions we've heard about

1092
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,719
the uh

1093
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,880
well the popularly published

1094
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,879
descriptions of the aliens

1095
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,200
the photos that you saw of the cadavers

1096
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,960
did they suggest faces like those that

1097
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,960
we saw in that tape and how do you

1098
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,480
explain that discrepancy uh some of the

1099
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,159
gentlemen walking around here with these

1100
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,880
strange white tags hanging off their

1101
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,558
collars it's a picture of an alien that

1102
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,160
pretty much characterized what they look

1103
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,000
like

1104
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,159
in the pictures that i saw it's entirely

1105
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,800
possible that those aliens which landed

1106
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:20,000
at holloman air force base

1107
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,240
uh were of a different species i do not

1108
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,239
know

1109
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:32,159
i have a question about uh a book that i

1110
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,880
discovered uh being mentioned in the

1111
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,960
flying saucer review

1112
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,680
in fact being debunked and ridiculed

1113
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,119
there and actually found bookstore in

1114
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:45,919
los angeles the book called rancher

1115
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,880
and when i opened it uh the thing that

1116
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,880
grabbed my attention was mentioning of

1117
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,599
university super university central

1118
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,519
universities loki universities and so on

1119
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,680
and having some

1120
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,599
background in physics in engineering and

1121
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,598
being interested in different dimensions

1122
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,880
i said well gee interesting

1123
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,000
got the book

1124
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,400
and

1125
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,960
i've been reading it carefully all these

1126
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,119
months it was

1127
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,800
written in

1128
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,640
3435 translated into english in the

1129
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,640
subsequent years

1130
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,078
probably distributed through

1131
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:21,679
your points are pleased we're running

1132
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:25,119
short on time my question is did you or

1133
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:27,440
find any mentioning of this book in the

1134
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,599
documents that you came in contact with

1135
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,679
because in the book there are many

1136
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,318
chapters that will describe alien

1137
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:36,318
anatomies of different dozens of cases

1138
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,400
well first of all i'm not familiar with

1139
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,318
the book what i saw in the document was

1140
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
technically oriented there was made

1141
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:45,519
mention of the possibility

1142
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,960
of uh interdimensional travel but at

1143
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,000
that point

1144
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,519
and now

1145
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,920
i have no knowledge of physics

1146
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,000
whatsoever so i could not answer you

1147
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,880
it's not a book about dimensions it's

1148
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,559
more a book about life in the universe

1149
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,318
and the different types of beings in the

1150
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,720
universe and they would have chapters

1151
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,440
and chapters of a listing of different

1152
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,679
biological types of entities a lot of

1153
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,679
knowledge in chemistry and physics

1154
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,598
astronomy and so on having not read the

1155
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:14,159
book i can't give you an honest and

1156
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,599
qualified answer last question

1157
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,318
yes sir bill

1158
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,680
we knew that the aliens are very good at

1159
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:23,039
telepathy

1160
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:26,558
now if in the early days the aliens were

1161
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,880
mistreated by uh humans don't you think

1162
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,240
that that was conveyed to the alien

1163
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,519
nation

1164
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:36,078
early on and as a result i mean don't

1165
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,800
you think they're waiting to get even or

1166
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,720
have gotten even

1167
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,880
well

1168
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,519
not being telepathic i can't answer that

1169
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,680
question unfortunately

1170
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:51,199
if they are telepathic i would imagine

1171
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,558
that if one knows they all know

1172
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,558
ladies and gentlemen i'd like to thank

1173
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,760
you very much for allowing me this time

1174
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,760

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,800
it seems appropriate to first take a few

1194
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,039
moments

1195
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,519
to personally thank mr walt anders of

1196
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:41,119
the mufon organization

1197
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,880
and the organizers and hosts of this

1198
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,798
symposium

1199
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,680
whose kind invitation made it possible

1200
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,679
for me to be here

1201
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,440
i'm also appreciative of this excellent

1202
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,119
time spot

1203
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,480
which must mean that those who arrange

1204
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,200
the schedule must think that i have

1205
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,199
something to say

1206
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,279
i'll try not to disappoint you

1207
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,760
i might also add that my talk here

1208
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,519
tonight is primarily directed at those

1209
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,000
of you who are members of the ufo

1210
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,000
community

1211
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,838
that's not to suggest that those of you

1212
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,480
who are here as third parties won't find

1213
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:16,480
it interesting

1214
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,720
it's just that you might not be able to

1215
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,639
follow some of the in-house comments i'm

1216
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:26,399
going to make

1217
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,400
and that's opposed to outhouse comments

1218
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,159
which i'll try to avoid even though some

1219
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,159
cases they may be appropriate

1220
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,400
having anticipated

1221
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,239
the faltering star

1222
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,000
allow me to introduce myself

1223
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,040
i'm aware that you already know my name

1224
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,880
and i'm equally certain that many of you

1225
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:51,679
are wondering

1226
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,720
just

1227
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:57,679
who is bill moore

1228
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,679
and what's he up to

1229
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,839
added to that i'm sure many other

1230
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,960
questions

1231
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:06,960
this man a government agent

1232
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,240
what about his rumored contacts within

1233
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,240
the intelligence community

1234
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,639
are the mj-12 documents real

1235
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:17,838
or are they counterfeit

1236
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:26,239
and if they're counterfeit

1237
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,240
did he forge them

1238
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,000
and

1239
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,559
isn't he really in it for the money

1240
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,559
after all

1241
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,318
the truth about bill moore i'm afraid is

1242
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,318
considerably less sensational

1243
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:44,519
those of you out there that know me well

1244
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,519
can vouch for it

1245
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,798
those who don't can verify it easily

1246
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,798
enough

1247
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,798
wilmore graduated from college in 1965.

1248
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:59,679
between that time in 1979 i spent 14

1249
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,838
years as a high school teacher

1250
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,358
and a concurrent 10 years as a part-time

1251
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:05,039
labor relations expert within the

1252
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,519
structure of the minnesota education

1253
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,279
association

1254
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,280
in both cases i had an excellent

1255
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,280
reputation

1256
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:17,440
in 1979

1257
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,519
after having successfully published the

1258
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,159
philadelphia experiment with co-author

1259
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,960
charles burlitz

1260
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:27,440
i resigned my teaching position

1261
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,119
and moved with my family to arizona

1262
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,200
in order to take up writing full time

1263
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,519
in 1980

1264
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,199
i co-authored a second bestseller the

1265
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,798
roswell incident

1266
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,039
which was the preliminary account of an

1267
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:45,000
investigation into an alleged ufo crash

1268
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,000
in new mexico in 1947

1269
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,359
at that time the book was skeptically

1270
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:53,358
received by the ufo community and

1271
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,358
mercilessly panned by the debunkers

1272
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:58,558
i stood my ground

1273
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,639
broke with berlitz

1274
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,599
weathered the storm of rocks and mud

1275
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:05,440
that was thrown in my direction

1276
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,960
and ultimately with continued high

1277
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:12,159
quality research and a careful skeptical

1278
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,159
journalistic approach

1279
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,079
managed to persuade many of the initial

1280
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,639
doubters that there was indeed something

1281
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,640
to the case

1282
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,798
and in so doing

1283
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,880
i earned the respect of many of you in

1284
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,798
the audience

1285
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,798
and i expect that my reputation and

1286
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:31,599
credibility with respect to the roswell

1287
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,280
case is at least partly responsible

1288
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,680
for my having been invited to speak here

1289
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:39,280
tonight

1290
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,279
i urge you to keep that in mind

1291
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,798
if you're one of those who respects my

1292
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,960
work on roswell then i ask you to

1293
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:45,838
consider that i'm trying to carry carry

1294
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,838
on

1295
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,679
the same sort of quality investigation

1296
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:53,279
with respect to my current project

1297
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:55,358
it's just that the circumstances are

1298
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,960
quite different

1299
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:58,960
and i've not been in a position until

1300
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,519
now to properly inform others about what

1301
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,519
i've been doing

1302
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,799
this unfortunately has given rise to

1303
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:08,639
considerable controversy

1304
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,199
with a number of falsehoods having been

1305
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,838
spread by others in the ufo community

1306
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:16,000
who saw fit to jump to hasty conclusions

1307
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:19,838
inappropriately formed

1308
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,838
without benefit of all the facts

1309
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:25,039
one of the most persistent rumors about

1310
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,719
me is that i'm a rich man

1311
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,480
or that i'm somehow funded by the

1312
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:32,719
government to spread disinformation and

1313
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:36,480
dissension within the ufo community

1314
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,480
neither could be further from the truth

1315
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,879
the real bill moore is as poor as a

1316
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,519
church mouse

1317
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,838
i came away from a divorce in 1983 with

1318
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,199
virtually

1319
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:49,679
nothing i went through bankruptcy

1320
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,639
shortly thereafter

1321
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:55,039
i began to rebuild my life

1322
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,039
the money i make from writing royalties

1323
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,798
and the sale of mostly ufo-oriented

1324
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,880
books and publications

1325
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,358
is all plowed back into living expenses

1326
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,440
and continuing research

1327
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:08,558
it's a constant scrape to get by but i

1328
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,559
believe in what i'm doing

1329
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:13,118
and in order to preserve the freedom

1330
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:15,679
necessary to continue

1331
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:18,160
i've had to make sacrifices

1332
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,159
i'm definitely not in this business for

1333
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:23,039
the money

1334
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:29,118
i live in a rented house

1335
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:31,599
i drive a 1977 car and a 1979 motorcycle

1336
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,960
i have no savings accounts

1337
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,640
no stops

1338
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,240
no bonds

1339
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,679
and i recently dropped my health

1340
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,439
insurance because i couldn't afford it

1341
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,639
any longer

1342
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,039
i'm not looking for a handout nor do i

1343
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,118
expect any sympathy

1344
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:49,679
i simply tell you this

1345
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,440
because i want it on the record

1346
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,118
those who are spreading rumors that i

1347
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,159
live in wealth and comfort are invited

1348
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:58,960
to come and verify the situation any

1349
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:02,000
time they wish

1350
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,358
my door is open

1351
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,679
those who allege that i have

1352
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:09,039
counterfeited documents

1353
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,879
and concocted a hoax on the mj-12 matter

1354
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:13,039
had better take the same facts into

1355
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,039
account

1356
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:18,159
rest assured

1357
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:21,599
i know myself well enough

1358
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:23,279
if i was trying to perpetrate a hoax

1359
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,079
i would have played it for all the cash

1360
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,040
i could get a long time ago

1361
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,640
and taken the money and run

1362
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:34,798
as some are doing

1363
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:36,318
even now in the ufo community

1364
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,400
and as far for my being on the

1365
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:41,599
government's payroll

1366
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,480
i can only say that i wish i was

1367
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:48,160
the government pays well

1368
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,159
and it provides excellent benefits

1369
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,440
so why should you believe anything bill

1370
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,200
moore has to say

1371
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,039
the fact is that i have information that

1372
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,199
will add to your knowledge of the ufo

1373
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,599
phenomenon

1374
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:03,199
i will report it to you in as a reliable

1375
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,838
fashion as i can

1376
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:09,358
and in as objective a manner as possible

1377
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:11,119
those of you who have numbered among my

1378
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,558
friends and supporters will perhaps find

1379
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,318
it comforting

1380
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,599
in light of some of the more outrageous

1381
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:19,440
rumors that have been circulating

1382
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,440
throughout the ufo community recently

1383
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,119
others of you who have

1384
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,200
who have chosen to cast aspersions and

1385
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,200
throw rocks in my directions out of fear

1386
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:30,000
that i might uncover something which

1387
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:32,159
will upstage your own efforts

1388
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,559
will undoubtedly take great great pains

1389
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:36,399
to dissect what i have to say here in an

1390
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,400
effort to find more reasons to question

1391
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,559
my integrity

1392
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,960
no matter

1393
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,880
in the final analysis i'm not asking you

1394
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,039
to believe

1395
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,119
only to listen

1396
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,599
what you do from that point is entirely

1397
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,599
up to you

1398
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,680
two years ago at the mufon symposium in

1399
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,440
washington dc

1400
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,679
i stood before a similar audience and

1401
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,760
presented preliminary information on the

1402
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:06,078
so-called mj12 papers

1403
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,400
i also alluded at that time

1404
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,079
to a series of ongoing contacts between

1405
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,599
myself and a number of well-placed

1406
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,798
individuals within the government and

1407
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,798
the intelligence community

1408
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,400
american ufology has been in a turmoil

1409
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:23,200
over the mj-12 matter ever since

1410
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,119
with charges and counter charges being

1411
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,719
thrown back and forth so fast that it's

1412
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:32,240
almost impossible to keep up with them

1413
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:35,759
worse the rumor mill

1414
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:37,919
fueled by speculation disinformation and

1415
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,200
increasingly gross exaggerations on the

1416
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,358
part of those who ought to know better

1417
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,239
has emerged as a major force which it

1418
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:48,239
sometimes seems from this vantage point

1419
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,199
has all but replaced common sense and

1420
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,719
sound judgment in some circles

1421
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:54,480
what ought to have been a sane and

1422
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,239
concerted effort to get it the truth is

1423
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,440
taken on virtually all the trappings of

1424
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:01,838
a three-ring circus

1425
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,519
and american ufology as i see it now

1426
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,838
stands at the edge of a severe crisis

1427
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,639
which has already shaken it

1428
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,639
to its very core

1429
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,879
i have every confidence that ufology

1430
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,558
will survive

1431
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,400
whether it will emerge from this present

1432
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,400
state of flux with its much as much

1433
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,559
credibility as it had going in i don't

1434
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,559
know

1435
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,720
i for one

1436
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,559
am somewhat ashamed

1437
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:28,798
and embarrassed

1438
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:31,920
by the mudslinging that i have witnessed

1439
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:34,559
much of it directed at me

1440
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,798
these past two years

1441
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,280
and by the incessant and increasing

1442
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:42,239
rumor mongering which has tantalized us

1443
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,000
all by its highly sensational nature

1444
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,598
and yet in the final analysis has

1445
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,239
offered us so very little in the way of

1446
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,160
tangible evidence

1447
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:51,838
i hope what i have to say here tonight

1448
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,399
will have the positive effect of laying

1449
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:56,639
some of it to rest

1450
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,160
but speaking in all candor

1451
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,159
i certainly won't count on it

1452
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,960
throughout our history mankind has

1453
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:07,358
witnessed many quests

1454
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,119
and in every case

1455
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,880
those who study history tell us that

1456
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,599
there was the inevitable clack of

1457
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,599
narrow-minded fools

1458
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,599
who believing that such quests waste

1459
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,039
time and energy better spent on useful

1460
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,039
endeavors

1461
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,400
did everything they could to discourage

1462
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,599
the process and discredit the

1463
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,599
individuals involved

1464
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:29,598
pardon my observations

1465
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,720
but so it is with our present quest for

1466
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,960
knowledge about ufos

1467
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,959
whether ufos are or are not

1468
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,880
extraterrestrial is really only a part

1469
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,798
of the picture

1470
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,798
in the final analysis

1471
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,519
the process of studying this phenomenon

1472
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,440
and the people involved with it

1473
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:50,159
of assessing the claims and the counter

1474
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,760
claims

1475
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,519
and of dealing with the question of how

1476
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,440
we as earthlings will react to the

1477
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,960
discovery of a race of extraterrestrial

1478
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,639
visitors and how they will react to us

1479
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,639
all of this and more when finally looked

1480
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:04,558
at in perspective

1481
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,358
leads us to the inescapable recognition

1482
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,200
that in studying the ufo phenomenon

1483
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:12,798
we are at the same time becoming more

1484
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:14,798
aware of ourselves as individuals

1485
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:18,599
and learning something about the society

1486
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,599
that we are a part of

1487
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,798
the recognition as noted by my friend

1488
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,640
stan friedman

1489
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:27,119
many years ago

1490
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,798
that any alien spending 10 minutes

1491
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,480
looking at planet earth

1492
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,960
must come away with the conclusion that

1493
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,798
we are in the eyes of that alien

1494
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,480
nothing more than a primitive society

1495
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:40,559
whose major activity is tribal warfare

1496
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,719
is it once both revealing

1497
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,039
and powerful

1498
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,959
it is through the mirror of ufos as

1499
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,119
alien visitors that we ultimately come

1500
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,519
to look at ourselves

1501
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,680
and to recognize what and who we really

1502
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,679
are

1503
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,280
such a process can only prove beneficial

1504
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,280
to mankind in the long term regardless

1505
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,519
of what the true nature of ufos turns

1506
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,000
out to be and those who would stand in

1507
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,480
its way by attempting to keep derision

1508
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,838
or ridicule upon the subject do us a

1509
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,838
grave disservice

1510
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,240
had mankind's greatest inventors

1511
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:21,679
scientists explorers builders painters

1512
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:23,439
musicians composers physicians surgeons

1513
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,719
the list goes on

1514
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,039
the point is

1515
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:28,959
had these people throughout our history

1516
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,960
heeded the mindless blusterings and

1517
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,358
ravings of the skeptics the scoffers and

1518
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,519
the debunkers who were present in each

1519
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,759
and every case

1520
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,838
there would have been no progress

1521
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:43,119
and mankind would still be in the stone

1522
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:44,960
age moreover

1523
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,680
in every case where a breakthrough was

1524
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,838
achieved and progress was made

1525
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:52,318
it is the achiever who is remembered and

1526
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,000
honored by history and not the debunker

1527
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,000
and the skeptic who said it could not be

1528
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
done

1529
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:08,239
the bottom line here is that the ufo

1530
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,719
phenomenon is

1531
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:13,118
a legitimate study

1532
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:16,078
by anyone in our free society who

1533
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,078
chooses to do so

1534
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,119
and those who have elected to

1535
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,798
participate in such a quest should not

1536
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,278
be held up to derision and ridicule

1537
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:26,560
because of it

1538
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:28,480
those debunkers and ufo bashers

1539
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,560
who have nothing positive to contribute

1540
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:34,119
are advised to go and massage their egos

1541
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,120
somewhere else

1542
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,759
in my opinion those people have no right

1543
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,920
whatsoever

1544
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,079
to dictate to others what is fit for

1545
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,480
study and what is not

1546
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:53,679
or what people should believe

1547
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:57,119
and what they shouldn't

1548
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,880
which brings me to my next point

1549
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,198
i've been accumulating information on

1550
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,520
the ufo phenomenon for more than 25

1551
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,519
years

1552
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,000
during that time i have watched ufology

1553
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,838
trying to grow up

1554
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,359
trying to achieve respectability with

1555
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:16,238
the public the news media and the

1556
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,480
scientific community

1557
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:20,959
in that process i am sorry to say it's

1558
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:23,678
been my observation that we have been

1559
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,520
our own worst enemy

1560
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,359
no skeptic

1561
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,359
no debunker

1562
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,359
could possibly do that we have done to

1563
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:35,520
ourselves not once

1564
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:38,400
but time and time again

1565
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,759
we say we want respectability

1566
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,759
yet we have made little effort to

1567
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,838
construct the foundations necessary to

1568
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,960
achieve it

1569
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,600
sadly

1570
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,520
we have no uniform standards

1571
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,798
no professional ethics

1572
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,239
no peers

1573
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:57,039
no qualifications no uniform goals and

1574
01:09:54,238 --> 01:10:00,158
few credible spokespersons

1575
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:02,880
nobody speaks for ufology

1576
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:05,599
or rather perhaps more correctly

1577
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,600
everybody speaks for ufology all at the

1578
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,600
same time and each with a different

1579
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,239
voice

1580
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,920
anybody can be a ufologist

1581
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,279
all they need to do is tack the title at

1582
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,119
the end of their name

1583
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,679
and publish

1584
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,198
yes even self-publish

1585
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,279
a book

1586
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,759
start a newsletter

1587
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,800
or get themselves on television

1588
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,800
and should their material be pure

1589
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,480
unsubstantiated clap trap or broken

1590
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,239
crockery

1591
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,759
that's cracked pottery for those of you

1592
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:37,279
that don't get that one

1593
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,039
no matter

1594
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,039
there's always some other self-styled

1595
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:42,840
ufologist who will come along

1596
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:45,198
see it as the ultimate wisdom of the

1597
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,719
universe and endorse it wholeheartedly

1598
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:48,719
thus adding further to the confusion

1599
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,640
is it any wonder

1600
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,159
we have degenerated into a host of

1601
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,840
political camps

1602
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:57,920
each one of which throws rocks at as

1603
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,920
many of the others as possible while at

1604
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,520
the same time loudly proclaiming to all

1605
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,158
who will listen that they are the only

1606
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,679
true religion

1607
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:08,399
meanwhile the debunkers who are

1608
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:10,239
essentially united under a single banner

1609
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:12,399
throw rocks at all of us

1610
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:14,559
and the public as hapless observer to

1611
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:17,039
the entire process emerges more confused

1612
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,039
than ever

1613
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,920
with that in mind

1614
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,279
i would like to take a moment and ask

1615
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:29,199
each and every member of this audience

1616
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:31,279
to reach down inside yourself

1617
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:34,719
and come up with a true answer to a very

1618
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:36,559
important and difficult question

1619
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,640
what you say publicly has no meaning in

1620
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,280
this process

1621
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,320
it's what you know inside of yourself to

1622
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,319
be truth that matters

1623
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,198
i want you to ask yourself

1624
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:50,479
why are you

1625
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:54,399
involved

1626
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:57,599
with the ufo phenomenon

1627
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:59,519
do you truly desire answers

1628
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,360
no matter what those answers may be and

1629
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,800
no matter how much those answers may be

1630
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,198
at variance with what you presently

1631
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,199
believe

1632
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,678
or are you one of those people who

1633
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:13,519
thrives on a continuing mystery

1634
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,679
whose very position in the field of

1635
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,280
ufology requires that the mystery of

1636
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:21,359
ufos be perpetuated rather than solved

1637
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:25,279
so that you can continue

1638
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,279
in your self-styled role of importance

1639
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:28,319
let's suppose you're the head of an

1640
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,079
organization devoted to the study of

1641
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,439
ufos

1642
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,920
and there are several such here

1643
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:35,678
including myself

1644
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,158
what happens to your organization and

1645
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:42,000
ultimately to you yourself

1646
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:45,679
if the ufo mystery is suddenly solved

1647
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,800
do you truly want to see that happen

1648
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,800
or is it more

1649
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,679
palatable and convenient to keep the pot

1650
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:54,320
simmering for as long as possible

1651
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:57,840
only you and you alone

1652
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:59,439
know what it is that motivates you

1653
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,520
if you're one who's sincerely interested

1654
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:05,439
in finding answers

1655
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,800
and if you can proceed with an open mind

1656
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,279
and maybe i can offer you some

1657
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:11,600
inspiration

1658
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:13,519
if on the other hand

1659
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,960
you are one who prefers to inflate your

1660
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,040
own image through the spreading of

1661
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,520
unsubstantiated often alarming and

1662
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:22,719
increasingly sensationalistic

1663
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,239
disinformation hearsay and rumor

1664
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,000
then i urge you to reassess your

1665
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:28,879
position and channel your energies along

1666
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,359
more acceptable lines

1667
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,440
if you haven't thought about that

1668
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,960
i urge you to do so

1669
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:38,879
it's important

1670
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:41,279
that we all know where we stand

1671
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,760
as for myself

1672
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,519
i made my decision a number of years ago

1673
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,640
as a result of suddenly having found

1674
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,320
myself

1675
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,159
face to face

1676
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:53,679
with an opportunity to learn more about

1677
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:55,679
what our government knows about ufos

1678
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,640
i believe then

1679
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,719
and i continue to believe now

1680
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,640
that it is possible to uncover answers

1681
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:06,000
by searching carefully and competently

1682
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,159
for them in the right places

1683
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,800
finding those answers and thus ending my

1684
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:13,359
so-called career as a ufologist poses no

1685
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,360
problems at all for me

1686
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,799
as a writer i'm interested in a variety

1687
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:20,319
of subjects

1688
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,239
many of them non-ufo related

1689
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,079
should i go as far as i feel i can with

1690
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,238
a ufo question i have plenty of other

1691
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,760
fish to fry

1692
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:30,959
many of which are just as interesting

1693
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,960
and every bit is challenging

1694
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:35,599
the truth

1695
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,840
fellow ufologists

1696
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,039
is that i have known precisely what i

1697
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,880
was doing all along

1698
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,039
it's just that very few other people

1699
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,800
knew what i was doing

1700
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,880
and it was this lack of information on

1701
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,640
the part of other researchers that has

1702
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,960
given rise to so much controversy

1703
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,640
consequently i harbor no grudge against

1704
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,480
others who have attacked me sometimes

1705
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,600
bitterly because they disagreed with my

1706
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:01,839
methods

1707
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,840
or because they mistook my refusal to

1708
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:07,760
answer their often legitimate questions

1709
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:10,719
as a display of arrogance and contempt

1710
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:13,440
i counseled patients then

1711
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,600
and i counsel it now

1712
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:17,839
a rush to judgment is a dangerous and a

1713
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,920
divisive thing

1714
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,760
those who engage in such practices may

1715
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,719
sound high-minded

1716
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,239
and well-informed at first blush

1717
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,760
but in the long run

1718
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:29,759
they do nothing to enhance their own

1719
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,679
stature or credibility

1720
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,800
and they certainly contribute nothing to

1721
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,800
our quest for answers

1722
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,239
consider the strange case of mr smith

1723
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:42,960
mr jones

1724
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:42,959
and the jury

1725
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:49,359
you the audience or the jury

1726
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:53,198
mr smith is dead

1727
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:55,198
mr jones is being tried for the murder

1728
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:58,238
the prosecutor stands before you and

1729
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,238
gives you these facts

1730
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,079
when the police arrived in response to a

1731
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:03,679
complaint that a fight was in progress

1732
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:05,600
he says

1733
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,158
mr smith was found lying dead on the

1734
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,039
floor of his apartment

1735
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:14,319
the cause of death was strangulation

1736
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:16,560
and the body was still warm

1737
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:18,479
mr jones was found bending over the body

1738
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,719
with his hands still around the victim's

1739
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,799
throat

1740
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,399
neighbors and others who knew both men

1741
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,320
have testified that there was

1742
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:28,319
considerable animosity between the two

1743
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:30,000
of them

1744
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,840
and that on more than one occasion mr

1745
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,800
jones was heard to threaten mr smith's

1746
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:37,119
safety and well-being

1747
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,880
obviously jones had gone to see smith

1748
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,760
and a violent argument ensued during

1749
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,159
which jones strangled smith

1750
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,000
unfortunately for jones the police

1751
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:49,119
arrived before he was able to affect and

1752
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,359
escape from the scene

1753
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:53,198
hear the jury

1754
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,920
is this sufficient evidence to condemn

1755
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,599
mr jones for murder

1756
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,279
i tried out this scenario during

1757
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,520
conversations with a number of people

1758
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:03,439
over the past few months

1759
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,159
and i was amazed at how many people

1760
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:07,919
agreed that it is

1761
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,599
one of whom was my good friend walt

1762
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,440
anders

1763
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,600
who recently saw fit to publish an

1764
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:15,279
outrageously lopsided piece of trash in

1765
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,440
his newsletter

1766
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:20,158
written by a man i've never met

1767
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,919
spoken to or corresponded with and who

1768
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:23,439
could have easily obtained answers to

1769
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,239
his questions simply by taking the

1770
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,238
trouble to ask

1771
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,239
a significant minority who listened to

1772
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:33,759
my smith and jones scenario however

1773
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:36,799
hesitated before passing judgment

1774
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,679
what is mr jones's defense

1775
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,679
they wanted to know

1776
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,640
and of course that's really what it's

1777
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,560
all about

1778
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,640
in the case of smith and jones the truth

1779
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,640
is that it was smith who invited jones

1780
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,199
to his apartment with the intention of

1781
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,280
quietly doing him in

1782
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,839
and disposing of the body before anyone

1783
01:17:55,279 --> 01:18:00,399
was the wiser

1784
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,159
however turned the tables on smith and

1785
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:05,039
accidentally killed him in the process

1786
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,879
of self-defense

1787
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,840
and so it is in the case of more the

1788
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,520
government and mj-12

1789
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,800
those who have already decided that i'm

1790
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,440
one of the bad guys in this

1791
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:19,039
controversial case have done so on the

1792
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,039
basis of only half a story

1793
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:23,519
they have rushed to judgment without

1794
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,279
hearing the defense

1795
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,800
indeed

1796
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:31,679
some of the most vocal of my critics

1797
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:35,039
have never once bothered to contact me

1798
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,679
and ask me if i had a defense

1799
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:40,000
tasty pudding as one recent track put it

1800
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:44,158
quite humorously

1801
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,158
attract which by the way i did not write

1802
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,399
but which i found to be most appropriate

1803
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,840
unfortunately i can't provide you with

1804
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:55,439
the entire case for the defense this

1805
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:57,039
evening the reason is the defense is

1806
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,960
still in process of completing its

1807
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,119
investigation

1808
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,039
but i can provide you with a significant

1809
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,119
part of it

1810
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:07,119
enough so that at least you can begin to

1811
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:10,238
understand what i've been doing

1812
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,238
and where it's all going

1813
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,520
for some of you

1814
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:18,079
it may not be what you want to hear

1815
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,280
but it's nonetheless true

1816
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:21,198
and it should provide you with a good

1817
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:23,359
sense of perspective concerning a lot of

1818
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:26,799
other things that have been going on in

1819
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:28,639
ufological circles recently

1820
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:32,320
it all began more than ten years ago

1821
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,320
with a man named paul benowitz

1822
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,880
let me preface my remarks by offering

1823
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:38,799
the sincere and candid statement that

1824
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,560
what i'm going to say

1825
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,480
is to the best of my knowledge entirely

1826
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,000
true

1827
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:45,919
it is offered without malice or

1828
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,279
prejudice in any way

1829
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,359
it is under no

1830
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,279
circumstances intended to be libelous or

1831
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:54,158
defamatory

1832
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:55,840
i genuinely like mr benowitz

1833
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,359
continue to regard him as a friend and

1834
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,000
have a great deal of sympathy for the

1835
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:01,920
difficulties he's been through

1836
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,600
it is not my intention to upset him with

1837
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,440
these revelations

1838
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,120
but rather to add a few facts to a

1839
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:09,599
record that's been out of balance for a

1840
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:12,479
lot of years

1841
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:16,000
i had moved from minnesota to arizona

1842
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:17,839
during the late summer of 1979

1843
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,760
and as a result had become somewhat

1844
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,199
closer to jim and carl lorenzon of the

1845
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,639
old aerial phenomena research

1846
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:24,559
organization

1847
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,800
or april

1848
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,480
in tucson

1849
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,239
ultimately they invited me to become a

1850
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:32,879
member of the april board of directors

1851
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,559
and i accepted

1852
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,079
it was in this capacity that i first

1853
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,080
became acquainted with the work being

1854
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,359
done by paul benowitz and dr leo

1855
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:41,519
sprinkle

1856
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:43,119
regarding an alleged ufo abduction

1857
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,560
involving a young woman and several

1858
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:46,960
others which had occurred sometime

1859
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,400
earlier

1860
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,039
the woman had been hypnotically

1861
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,719
regressed by dr sprinkle

1862
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,479
and had provided a strange account of

1863
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:55,760
having witnessed a cattle mutilation in

1864
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,759
process

1865
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,600
and if subsequently having been taken by

1866
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,199
her alien abductors into some sort of

1867
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,280
craft or facility

1868
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,439
where these aliens were actively engaged

1869
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:09,119
in processing fluids and sever severed

1870
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:10,559
body parts obtained from these cattle

1871
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,238
during the course of the hypnosis

1872
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,199
sessions which began as near as i can

1873
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:17,119
recall in august of 1979

1874
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,879
benowitz had become convinced that the

1875
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:22,079
aliens had implanted some sort of

1876
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,000
communication device in the woman's head

1877
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:26,238
and that they were using this device to

1878
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,158
control her actions

1879
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,000
his theory was that they could actually

1880
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:32,000
see what she saw

1881
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,880
and hear what she heard

1882
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,399
by means of this device

1883
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,079
in any case

1884
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,599
bennowitz being a physicist by

1885
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,519
profession and having a certain amount

1886
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,039
of electronics equipment at his disposal

1887
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,239
and the wherewithal to purchase more as

1888
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:46,000
needed

1889
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:47,839
set out to determine whether it might be

1890
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,760
possible to detect the electromagnetic

1891
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,639
signals he believed these aliens must be

1892
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,560
using

1893
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,560
to exercise their control over their

1894
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,320
alleged victims

1895
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,520
and to try to devise a way to shield the

1896
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:02,960
victim from the control of the signals

1897
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:06,639
he dubbed his effort project beta

1898
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,399
and communicated to apro in late 1979

1899
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,279
that he believed he had succeeded in

1900
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:13,359
detecting signals from ufos

1901
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:15,119
and had begun to make calculations about

1902
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:18,479
the sort of electronic and propulsion

1903
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:20,399
technology employed by these aliens

1904
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,079
it was also at about this time that paul

1905
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:23,679
began to take both moving and still

1906
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,519
pictures of strange lights maneuvering

1907
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:27,600
in the vicinity of the manzano nuclear

1908
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,199
weapons storage facility which is

1909
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,120
located on the east of kirtland air

1910
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,879
force base in albuquerque

1911
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:35,279
and of which benowitz had a perfect view

1912
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,039
from his residence

1913
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:39,039
benowitz was convinced that these lights

1914
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:40,399
were ufos

1915
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,399
and that for some reason they were

1916
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:45,198
actively interested in both the manzano

1917
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:47,198
complex and the coyote canyon test area

1918
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:49,919
located directly south of manzano on the

1919
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:51,839
other side of the hills

1920
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,679
during this time the only awareness i

1921
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,840
had of benowitz in his work was what i

1922
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:58,158
was obtaining through april

1923
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,079
i still had not met the man

1924
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,679
and in fact was only mildly interested

1925
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:03,600
in the case

1926
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,600
this based largely upon both jim and

1927
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,600
carl lorenzon's assessment of benowitz

1928
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,400
is a dedicated researcher

1929
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,280
but unfortunately one who was as jim put

1930
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,279
it

1931
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:16,719
prone to make great leaps of logic on

1932
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:18,880
the basis of incomplete data

1933
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,480
both jim and carl felt that benowitz had

1934
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,679
already decided what he was going to

1935
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:25,198
find before he went looking for it

1936
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,719
still

1937
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,559
although i didn't come to know about it

1938
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:30,319
until a few months later

1939
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,800
there apparently was something going on

1940
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:34,639
involving ufos near manzano particularly

1941
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,480
during august september and october of

1942
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,159
1980

1943
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,759
and several agencies of the u s

1944
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,399
government including the air force

1945
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,239
office of special investigations

1946
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:46,238
seem more than just casually interested

1947
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:49,678
in it

1948
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:51,439
in early september 1980

1949
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,279
i was approached by a well-placed

1950
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:54,879
individual within the intelligence

1951
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:56,559
community who claimed to be directly

1952
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,520
connected to a high-level government

1953
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,639
project

1954
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:03,360
dealing with ufos

1955
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:05,679
this individual who subsequently came to

1956
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:07,519
be known as the falcon

1957
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,960
told me that he spoke for a small group

1958
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,320
of similar individuals who were

1959
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,639
uncomfortable with the government's

1960
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:14,319
continuing cover-up of the truth

1961
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,079
and indicated that he and his group

1962
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,599
would like to help me with my research

1963
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:19,279
into the subject

1964
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,639
in the hope that i might be able to help

1965
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,479
them find a way to change their

1966
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:26,079
prevailing policy and get the facts out

1967
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:29,198
without breaking any laws in the process

1968
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:30,559
i knew i was being recruited

1969
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:34,079
but at that point

1970
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,080
i had no idea for what

1971
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,839
in any case i was told that if i was

1972
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:39,920
interested in cooperating with their

1973
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,840
group i would further be contacted by a

1974
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,520
liaison man

1975
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,199
and that future meetings between me and

1976
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,360
the falcon would be arranged by this

1977
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:49,759
person

1978
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,759
the liaison person who subsequently made

1979
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,199
contact with me

1980
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,880
was afosi agent richard doty

1981
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,439
a man who has since become quite

1982
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,119
controversial in his own right

1983
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:04,719
and who many people have mistakenly

1984
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:07,760
assumed is the falcon himself

1985
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,800
the story of my contacts with the falcon

1986
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,520
doty

1987
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,199
and subsequently a number of others

1988
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,600
is something i will have considerably

1989
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,359
more to say about at a later date

1990
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,719
i'm fully aware that such a course of

1991
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,479
action will undoubtedly prompt the

1992
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,158
gospel gossip mongers to begin

1993
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:24,319
circulating an entirely new array of

1994
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,479
outrageous and unsubstantiated rumors

1995
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:28,158
but so be it

1996
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:29,759
my purpose here is to deal only with

1997
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:32,638
that part of the story which is directly

1998
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,079
connected to the bennowitz affair

1999
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,800
to those of you who want to know more

2000
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:39,279
after hearing what i had to say tonight

2001
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,880
i counsel continued patience

2002
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:42,719
you have my assurance that the rest of

2003
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,159
the story will ultimately be told as

2004
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,000
well

2005
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:47,679
but before going back to the benowitz

2006
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,359
affair

2007
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,239
let me make several points which seem

2008
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:55,039
appropriate at this juncture

2009
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:57,039
first of all on the question of richard

2010
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:59,119
dodie and the falcon

2011
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:01,359
it's important to note that the name

2012
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:05,359
falcon was invented by my partner jamie

2013
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:07,198
chanderay and i in 1984.

2014
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:09,279
strictly as a way of facilitating our

2015
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:12,158
talking to each other about this person

2016
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:15,039
particularly on the telephone

2017
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:17,198
without having to use a name

2018
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:20,399
richard doty who continued to be liaison

2019
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:24,079
man was similarly referred to us

2020
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:25,839
or by us as the sparrow

2021
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:27,439
neither sparrow nor falcon were aware

2022
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,159
that we were using these terms in

2023
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:31,919
reference to them nor was anyone else

2024
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:35,719
to the best of my knowledge

2025
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,719
prior to about mid-1985

2026
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:41,599
it was in mid-1987

2027
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:43,198
just after we went public with the mj-12

2028
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,039
papers

2029
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,279
that at falcon's suggestion and with the

2030
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:49,039
concurrence of richard doty

2031
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:52,880
we began dropping subtle hints that

2032
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:54,639
falcon might in fact be doty

2033
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,400
falcon felt that such a ploy would be

2034
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,480
useful to him in continuing to protect

2035
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,079
his identity

2036
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,079
while dodi for his part said that if

2037
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:05,840
anybody asked he could simply deny it

2038
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:09,039
and that would be that we agreed

2039
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,639
and as many of you are painfully aware

2040
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:12,880
it turned out to be an excellent

2041
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,480
diversion

2042
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,639
particularly with respect to the

2043
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,718
affected head following the ufo cover-up

2044
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,920
live show which was podcast nationally

2045
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:24,800
in october 1988

2046
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,719
in all fairness to mr doty here

2047
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,239
i should also like to comment that in my

2048
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,079
assessment

2049
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,238
rick is much better at following orders

2050
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:33,920
and implementing the schemes of others

2051
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:36,000
than he is at coming up with ideas of

2052
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,840
his own

2053
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
those of you that have devoted time and

2054
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,000
energy to constantly badgering this man

2055
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,679
for more information

2056
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,719
should be aware that all you are doing

2057
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:48,880
is making nuisances of yourself

2058
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:50,639
rick is not the man you're after

2059
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,039
it's the person in the control position

2060
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,520
that's important here

2061
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:57,439
and as far as i'm aware

2062
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,120
no one outside of my project has any

2063
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,839
idea who that person might be or what

2064
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:01,840
his motives are

2065
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:05,679
in any case

2066
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,399
it was falcon who sought me out in

2067
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,399
september of 1980

2068
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:12,559
and it was richard doty

2069
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:13,519
then with afosi at kirtland air force

2070
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,120
base

2071
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,080
who soon came into play as the middle

2072
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:20,158
man in that process

2073
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:21,840
shortly thereafter

2074
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:24,960
it became apparent to me that my

2075
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,560
supplying information to the government

2076
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,760
through doty

2077
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,120
on the activities of paul benowitz

2078
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:33,119
april

2079
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:34,399
and to a lesser extent several other

2080
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:38,238
individuals

2081
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:40,238
was to be a part of this equation

2082
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:42,799
i also discovered that whatever it was

2083
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,559
that benowitz was involved with

2084
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,880
he was the subject of considerable

2085
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,600
interest on the part of not one but

2086
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,119
several government agencies

2087
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,079
and that they were actively trying to

2088
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,439
defuse him by pumping as much

2089
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:58,800
mis-disinformation through him

2090
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:00,799
as he could possibly absorb

2091
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,320
being a very small part of that process

2092
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,400
gave me i thought something of an

2093
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,238
advantage

2094
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:07,839
it became my intention to play that

2095
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,879
advantage for all the information i

2096
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,800
could get out of it

2097
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,319
benowitz for his part continued to make

2098
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,199
what in my opinion seemed to be

2099
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:18,960
increasingly irrational claims

2100
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,559
most of which gave every appearance of

2101
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,119
having been influenced by a heavy

2102
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,800
blanket of disinformation

2103
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,039
mixed with a small but significant

2104
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,880
amount of truth

2105
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:31,198
the problem was always one of keeping a

2106
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,840
level head and trying to carefully sort

2107
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:35,279
the from the candy

2108
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,600
something which paul didn't seem to be

2109
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,599
very good at

2110
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,760
but then paul was by that time very

2111
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,440
emotionally involved with the affair and

2112
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,960
rather skeptical of advice from any

2113
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:47,759
quarter unless it supported what he had

2114
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,920
already decided was the truth

2115
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,679
from my vantage point

2116
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,279
being detached from the mainstream but

2117
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,960
still close enough to appreciate what

2118
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:56,800
was happening

2119
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,198
it was somewhat easier to assess the

2120
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:03,119
process

2121
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:04,799
i first met paul in early 1981

2122
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:08,960
and continued contacts with him on a

2123
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:12,320
fairly regular basis through mid-1985

2124
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:14,239
contact since then has been sporadic

2125
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:16,479
my role in the affair was largely that

2126
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,839
of a freelancer providing information on

2127
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:21,439
paul's then current thinking and

2128
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,960
activities i had nothing whatsoever to

2129
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:25,119
do with the counter intelligence and the

2130
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,119
disinformation

2131
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:28,960
although i either knew

2132
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:30,399
or was aware of a number of people

2133
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,000
directly involved with that end of

2134
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,879
things

2135
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,319
richard doty was one of these people

2136
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,679
although i came to know dodie well

2137
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:39,920
enough to gain the impression that he

2138
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:43,520
was faithfully carrying out orders which

2139
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:45,039
he personally found distasteful

2140
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,280
perhaps it was for this reason that the

2141
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:49,920
falcon had chosen him as liaison person

2142
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,759
although i don't really know

2143
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,199
frankly i don't believe that dodie does

2144
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,679
either

2145
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,919
in my opinion he was simply a pawn

2146
01:30:55,679 --> 01:31:00,880
in a much larger game

2147
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,880
just as i was

2148
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:05,599
as for benefits

2149
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,599
by 1981 he was gathering data from a

2150
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,440
variety of sources and amalgamating it

2151
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,679
with information being fed to him by a

2152
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:13,039
number of government people in whom for

2153
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:15,840
some reason he seemed to have an

2154
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:17,920
implicit and abiding

2155
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,239
the story that emerged from this melange

2156
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:22,560
of fact fiction fantasy hearsay hard

2157
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:24,959
data and government disinformation was

2158
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:28,000
absolutely incredible

2159
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:30,239
yet somehow paul believed in it

2160
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,920
and set out on a one-man crusade to tell

2161
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:32,879
the world that malevolent aliens from

2162
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,399
space

2163
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,960
were in league with our government to

2164
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:39,679
take over the planet

2165
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,679
what had begun in 1979 is an effort to

2166
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:44,000
learn whether the behavior of a woman

2167
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:46,000
who claimed she had been abducted by ufo

2168
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,800
aliens and was being influenced by some

2169
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,639
sort of radio remote control

2170
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,400
had in the space of less than three

2171
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,400
years

2172
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:57,119
blossomed into a tale which rivaled the

2173
01:31:54,399 --> 01:32:00,158
wildest science fiction scenario anyone

2174
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,920
could possibly imagine

2175
01:32:00,158 --> 01:32:03,920
basically it seemed to me that paul was

2176
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,600
his own worst enemy

2177
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,600
instead of withholding judgment until

2178
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,440
all of the facts were in paul insisted

2179
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,920
on repeatedly going off half to

2180
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:13,599
virtually anyone who would listen

2181
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,560
members of the press

2182
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,800
other ufo researchers us congressmen and

2183
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,880
senators people in military command

2184
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:24,320
positions members of the scientific

2185
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,279
establishment even the president himself

2186
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:28,079
all

2187
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,759
were members or subjects of paul's

2188
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,359
efforts to reach out and tell the world

2189
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,960
what he sincerely believed to be

2190
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:34,880
happening

2191
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,639
he wrote letters and made phone calls by

2192
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,400
the hundreds

2193
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:40,159
and to those who had neither the time

2194
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,839
nor the inclination to look behind the

2195
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:43,279
words for a better understanding of the

2196
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,440
facts

2197
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:48,000
paul with his professional credentials

2198
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:50,319
and technical vocabulary came off as a

2199
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,920
rather credible individual

2200
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:53,359
which must have caused quite a rash of

2201
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,359
headaches among the people in high

2202
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,759
places who are desperately trying to

2203
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:57,759
defuse

2204
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:13,360
him the idea that ufos had something to

2205
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:13,359
do with the phenomenon

2206
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,679
number two

2207
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:19,760
an increasing number of ufo cases

2208
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,800
wherein the individual or individuals

2209
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,639
involved

2210
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,239
claimed to have been abducted by ufo

2211
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,319
aliens and taken aboard their craft

2212
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:28,319
against their will

2213
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:30,559
public exposure to this phenomenon got a

2214
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:32,319
big boost in 1981

2215
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,000
with the appearance of bud hopkins best

2216
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,079
seller missing time

2217
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,079
and paul was particularly interested in

2218
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:39,920
these cases

2219
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:41,119
his hypothesis that people were being

2220
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,719
abducted

2221
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:44,079
implanted with some kind of alien

2222
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:45,679
control device

2223
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,279
and then being let go again was

2224
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:49,119
completely consistent with the thinking

2225
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,800
of a number of other ufo researchers at

2226
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:52,880
the time

2227
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,800
paul's hypothesis however

2228
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:57,119
had a somewhat more sinister spin than

2229
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,119
most

2230
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,399
third

2231
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,080
his own experiments and research

2232
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:03,759
regarding the radio signals he was

2233
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,960
receiving in the photographs and film

2234
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:09,199
footage he was getting of unusual lights

2235
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,639
both of these phenomena seemed largely

2236
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:12,399
though not entirely connected with

2237
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:15,039
goings on within the kirtland air force

2238
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:17,198
base sandia national lab complex just

2239
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:18,639
south of albuquerque

2240
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:20,559
there is no question that paul was

2241
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:22,639
receiving some sort of electromagnetic

2242
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,000
signal on his equipment

2243
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:25,920
and it is equally certain that his

2244
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,198
photos and films do depict unusual

2245
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,880
lights

2246
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:31,039
most of which were filmed while hovering

2247
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,400
or maneuvering over the kirtland sandia

2248
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:34,560
complex

2249
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,319
the real question here however is

2250
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,080
whether paul's evidence is sufficient to

2251
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:41,039
conclude that either of these phenomena

2252
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:43,359
was directly related to ufo activity

2253
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:45,600
or whether in fact a prosaic explanation

2254
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:48,639
exists which is more directly related to

2255
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:51,440
some classified government project

2256
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:53,279
admittedly strong arguments can be made

2257
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:55,118
in both directions

2258
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:57,279
either one of which can be offered as an

2259
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:59,118
adequate explanation of the government's

2260
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:02,639
counter-intelligence activities in this

2261
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:04,559
case which was the fourth factor

2262
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,000
government surveillance of paul and his

2263
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,679
activities

2264
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,279
some of which paul was astute enough to

2265
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:13,719
detect and some of which i had learned

2266
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:13,719
about that paul seemed unaware of

2267
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:17,760
took the surveillance activities which

2268
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,320
included wiretaps and according to paul

2269
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,960
even break-ins as proof positive that he

2270
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:26,079
was onto something big

2271
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:28,480
unfortunately he seemed largely unaware

2272
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:31,118
that the same people who would go to

2273
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,959
such lengths to spy on him

2274
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:36,799
also had the capabilities to mount an

2275
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:40,000
effective disinformation campaign

2276
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,840
in any case by mid-1982

2277
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,840
paul's story contained virtually all of

2278
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,079
the elements found in the current crop

2279
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,239
of rumors being circulated around the

2280
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:50,319
ufo community

2281
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:53,759
there were two groups of aliens

2282
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:55,679
one malevolent one more friendly

2283
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,639
the malevolent ones which paul referred

2284
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:00,800
to as the greys were really in control

2285
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:02,639
and they were the ones responsible for

2286
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,400
the cattle mutilations

2287
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,079
for human abductions

2288
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:08,158
and the implanting of sinister control

2289
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:09,920
devices in humans

2290
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,719
for having first made and then broken

2291
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,480
the secret treaty with the us government

2292
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,560
for maintaining a secret underground

2293
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:18,718
base under archuleta peak near dulce and

2294
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,239
northwestern new mexico

2295
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,000
and for having supplied the us

2296
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:23,599
government with aliens based hardware

2297
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,399
and weapons which ultimately proved

2298
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,079
defective or which were caused to crash

2299
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:31,359
thus leaving human civilization

2300
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:33,519
virtually defenseless against invasion

2301
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:35,439
according to paul

2302
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,960
an atomic powered spaceship which they

2303
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:38,960
had given to the us

2304
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,719
had been caused to crash in archuleta

2305
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,158
peak near the entrance to an underground

2306
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,000
alien base

2307
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:46,479
and it sprayed the entire area with

2308
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,760
radioactivity and wreckage

2309
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:49,599
to prove it

2310
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,400
he provided drawings which he said he

2311
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:54,800
had made from photographs

2312
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,479
i and others would examine paul's

2313
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,639
photographs as well as independently

2314
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,678
explain obtained pictures of the same

2315
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:01,920
area

2316
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:03,440
were unable to see what paul claimed was

2317
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,760
there

2318
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:08,238
where he saw a crashed ship

2319
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,800
burned wreckage entrances to the alien

2320
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:13,359
base and weapons pointing skyward

2321
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,199
others could only see rocks trees and

2322
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:17,279
shadows

2323
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:19,599
i have no doubt that paul believed that

2324
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,559
he saw what he claimed

2325
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:25,600
and for this i offer no explanation

2326
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:29,039
i only know that what he claimed to see

2327
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,039
wasn't what others saw

2328
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:34,479
there is no question that some of

2329
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:36,719
benowitz's pictures are interesting

2330
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:38,238
but i must say that even though i viewed

2331
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,840
a large number of them

2332
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:41,839
i never saw one that i could get

2333
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,440
particularly excited about

2334
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,039
and i certainly never saw anything that

2335
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:47,198
i felt could be pointed to as proof

2336
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,639
positive or even compelling evidence

2337
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:50,638
that he was photographing alien

2338
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,079
spacecraft

2339
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,840
much of his film was super eight

2340
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:57,118
millimeter which is too small a format

2341
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,119
for good quality enlargement

2342
01:37:57,279 --> 01:38:01,118
there is also no question that paul was

2343
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:03,920
intercepting some kind of low frequency

2344
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:06,238
electromagnetic emission

2345
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,399
the question was and remains

2346
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,479
where was it coming from

2347
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:12,559
what was its purpose

2348
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,839
and indeed most importantly

2349
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:18,400
was it ufo related at

2350
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:20,319
all paul at least was totally convinced

2351
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:22,319
that he was receiving alien radio

2352
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:24,319
transmissions

2353
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,079
and had even gone so far as to develop a

2354
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:29,039
home computer program capable of

2355
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:30,800
translating them into english

2356
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:32,560
the problem as i saw it was that his

2357
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,000
program which he told me had been

2358
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,320
developed with the assistance of the

2359
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,719
aliens themselves

2360
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:40,319
assigned entire words

2361
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,719
sentence fragments

2362
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:45,439
and sometimes even entire sentences

2363
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,800
themselves to the various individual

2364
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:48,799
pulses of energy within these

2365
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,199
transmissions

2366
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,520
the technique involved was such that it

2367
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:56,000
could just as easily have been adapted

2368
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,679
to assign similar alien translations to

2369
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,399
the various energy pulses found in

2370
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:02,079
ordinary morse code

2371
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,679
i have a number of paul's computer

2372
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:05,840
printouts

2373
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:08,960
which contain translations of those

2374
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,639
allegedly alien messages

2375
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,560
if one breaks these apart into their

2376
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:13,840
component words sentence fragments and

2377
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,560
sentences

2378
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,639
and then shuffles the components

2379
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,400
the result is such that the new message

2380
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,000
says virtually the same thing as the old

2381
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:24,238
one

2382
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,079
the messages look fascinating

2383
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:28,319
until one examines the method by which

2384
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:30,399
they were derived

2385
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:32,158
after that they are not nearly so

2386
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:34,079
interesting

2387
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:36,079
unfortunately lots of people saw the

2388
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:38,158
messages

2389
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:39,920
very few had the opportunity to examine

2390
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:42,000
the computer program which generated

2391
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,000
them

2392
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:45,678
along these same lines at least some of

2393
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:47,599
the things paul was seeing and

2394
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:51,199
identifying his alien spacecraft were

2395
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,880
definitely not ufos at all

2396
01:39:51,198 --> 01:39:55,198
one evening while visiting him we went

2397
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,800
out in his sundeck just at twilight

2398
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:58,719
and he pointed out a series of lights

2399
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,239
slowly maneuvering far out over the west

2400
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:04,399
mesa perhaps 25 or 30 miles away

2401
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:07,839
these he said were alien craft involved

2402
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:09,759
in abducting people and implanting

2403
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,600
there certainly were lights maneuvering

2404
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,199
out there

2405
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:15,920
but even through good binoculars they

2406
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:19,279
were not readily identifiable

2407
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:20,719
paul insisted they were ufos

2408
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,479
and showed us how to conduct a little

2409
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:25,039
test with our binoculars which he said

2410
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:26,158
would prove it

2411
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:27,760
interested

2412
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:29,599
but unconvinced

2413
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,280
i drove directly to west mesa

2414
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,119
immediately after leaving paul's home

2415
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,479
and parked my car at a spot where i felt

2416
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,279
i would be able to get a good look at

2417
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:38,638
anything flying around that area

2418
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:40,800
sure enough

2419
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:43,279
helicopters carrying large searchlights

2420
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:46,800
began to maneuver slowly over my vantage

2421
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:48,800
point only moments after i arrived

2422
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,880
one went directly over me at an altitude

2423
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,960
of about 300 feet

2424
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,880
and there is no doubt that it was a

2425
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,359
helicopter

2426
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,880
the next day i called kirkland

2427
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:00,559
and they confirmed to me that there had

2428
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,440
indeed been a search and rescue training

2429
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,199
mission in that area the night before

2430
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:06,559
such operations they informed me were

2431
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:08,238
conducted over that area quite

2432
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,199
frequently

2433
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:13,919
that was in 1982

2434
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,839
two years later in 1984

2435
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:17,520
paul was still making the same claims

2436
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,239
about these maneuvering lights to other

2437
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:22,000
ufo researchers

2438
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:23,599
as far as i'm aware

2439
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
i was the only one who took the trouble

2440
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,000
to check

2441
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,319
paul is a convincing and compelling

2442
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,479
individual in person

2443
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:34,238
he talks an excellent story

2444
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:35,759
and it's easy to see why so many people

2445
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:37,599
have been so intrigued by it over the

2446
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,119
years

2447
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,480
unfortunately

2448
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:42,238
too many of the people who have

2449
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:44,879
interviewed paul have chosen to draw

2450
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:48,319
their conclusions about him based solely

2451
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,880
or largely upon what he says

2452
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:52,479
and not upon the entire body of evidence

2453
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,039
presented by the larger picture of the

2454
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:57,359
case itself

2455
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:59,519
i too have spent considerable time with

2456
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:01,118
paul over a period of years

2457
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,119
and came to know him quite well in that

2458
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:04,880
process

2459
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:06,880
as already stated

2460
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:08,880
i viewed a large number of paul's films

2461
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,800
and photographs

2462
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,400
i carefully examined satellite and

2463
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,800
aerial survey photographs of both

2464
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:16,799
archuleta peak and mesa as well as

2465
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,560
aerial photos of the area taken by paul

2466
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,639
himself

2467
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,639
i examined the computer program paul was

2468
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:24,880
using to decode the alleged alien radio

2469
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,400
transmissions and communications

2470
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,000
and i had a lengthy discussion about

2471
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:28,960
this matter with the late dr alan

2472
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,279
heineck

2473
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,600
who is also who had also independently

2474
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:35,519
examined paul's program

2475
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:38,480
i spent considerable time discussing the

2476
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,360
affair with both jim and carl lorenzon

2477
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:43,198
both of whom were quite skeptical of it

2478
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:44,880
and i have copies of many of the reports

2479
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:46,479
and letters paul submitted to afro

2480
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,440
beginning as far back as september of

2481
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:49,439
1979

2482
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,760
moreover

2483
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:56,319
as i have already stated

2484
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:58,079
i was personally aware of the

2485
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:01,439
intelligence community's concerted

2486
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:04,079
efforts to systematically confuse

2487
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,000
discourage and discredit paul

2488
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:08,639
by providing him with a large body of

2489
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,560
information on the subject of ufos

2490
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,679
the malevolent aliens who allegedly

2491
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,000
pilot them

2492
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,840
the technology they employ and the

2493
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,158
underground bases they supposedly

2494
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:20,079
possess and occupy

2495
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:22,079
the entire story

2496
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:24,960
of a secret treaty between the u.s

2497
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:28,238
government and the aliens of exchanges

2498
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:30,239
of technology between us and the aliens

2499
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:31,678
of battles between aliens and american

2500
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,759
armed forces

2501
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,760
and of aliens allegedly having implanted

2502
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,840
hundreds of thousands if not millions of

2503
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,360
human beings for that for the purpose of

2504
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,360
taking over the world

2505
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:42,880
and using us as cattle

2506
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:44,238
or slaves

2507
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,719
came about

2508
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:48,158
as a result of the disinformation

2509
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,920
process

2510
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:52,000
i know

2511
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,719
because i was in a position to observe

2512
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,880
much of this process as it unfolded

2513
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:59,439
and i was providing regular

2514
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,359
regular reports on its effectiveness to

2515
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:03,279
some of the very people who were doing

2516
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:06,799
it to paul

2517
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:08,238
and i can tell you that it was effective

2518
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,800
because i watched paul become

2519
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:13,279
systematically more paranoid

2520
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,880
and more emotionally unstable

2521
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:17,039
as he tried to assimilate what was

2522
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,880
happening to him

2523
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:21,679
he had guns and knives all over his

2524
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:23,039
house he had installed extra locks on

2525
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,880
his doors

2526
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:27,039
and he swore that they

2527
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,639
meaning the aliens were coming through

2528
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:30,399
his walls at night and injecting him

2529
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:33,520
with hideous chemicals which would knock

2530
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,920
him out for long periods of time

2531
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:38,000
he told me they had no id he had no idea

2532
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,760
what they were doing with him after he

2533
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,679
was knocked out

2534
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,360
he began to suffer increasing bouts of

2535
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,880
insomnia

2536
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:46,399
others took over the day-to-day

2537
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,159
operation of his business as he went

2538
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:50,879
through this

2539
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:53,679
one day i watched him eat not a bite of

2540
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:57,039
his lunch while he chain smoked 28

2541
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:59,279
cigarettes in 45 minutes

2542
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:02,000
i knew at that time that he was not far

2543
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:04,158
from an inevitable nervous collapse

2544
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,158
his health deteriorated

2545
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:08,638
he'd lost considerable weight

2546
01:45:06,158 --> 01:45:10,479
his hand shook as if from palsy and he

2547
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,159
looked terrible

2548
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:14,158
i tried to counsel him to drop the

2549
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:16,319
entire ufo thing before his health was

2550
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:17,920
completely destroyed

2551
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:20,639
he said he knew things were getting bad

2552
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,880
and he was trying to cope with it

2553
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,880
not long afterward i heard he had been

2554
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,800
hospitalized and was under psychiatric

2555
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,279
care

2556
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,119
whether ufos were actually ever involved

2557
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:33,840
with all of this and to what extent i

2558
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:33,839
never really knew

2559
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,439
perhaps paul had merely stumbled upon

2560
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,679
signals generated from some

2561
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:41,359
sophisticated high-level government

2562
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,158
project whose security people had hit

2563
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:47,118
upon ufo-related disinformation as their

2564
01:45:44,158 --> 01:45:49,759
ultimate ultimate cover

2565
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:51,519
or perhaps he had discovered a real

2566
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,679
although somewhat less sensational

2567
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,360
government ufo project

2568
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,359
if that's possible

2569
01:45:55,359 --> 01:46:00,079
which elected to disinform him to

2570
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:01,679
protect what they were really doing

2571
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,000
i do know

2572
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,600
from firsthand experience

2573
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,560
that there was a tremendous amount of

2574
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:10,320
government disinformation involved

2575
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,000
and that a large proportion of what we

2576
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:12,960
are hearing today about malevolent

2577
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,039
aliens

2578
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,560
underground bases secret treaties with

2579
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:18,238
the us government

2580
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,960
has its roots firmly planted in the

2581
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:23,519
benowitz affair

2582
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,439
stories of an alleged ufo crash at aztec

2583
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,719
new mexico are also a part of this

2584
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:28,638
picture

2585
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,880
but i'll say comment on that until later

2586
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:32,800
in this paper

2587
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,118
in any case

2588
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,360
from what i knew of all of this

2589
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,719
its purpose was strictly to discredit

2590
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:41,118
benowitz

2591
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:42,560
and nothing more

2592
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:45,039
what amazes me

2593
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,560
is that nearly a decade later these same

2594
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:50,880
stories continue to circulate

2595
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,800
recently one of the most prominent

2596
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,719
figures in the current disinformation

2597
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,000
wave which has been sweeping the ufo

2598
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:58,960
community

2599
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,118
was quoted as having stated that he

2600
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:04,399
found paul benowitz's information to be

2601
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:06,079
100 true

2602
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:08,000
this person spent a couple of days

2603
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:10,158
talking to benowitz back in septem in

2604
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,118
the summer of 1987

2605
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:15,279
and he has spent considerable time since

2606
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:18,238
spreading elaborate and increasingly

2607
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:20,158
sensationalistic stories based he claims

2608
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:22,799
on information gathered from a variety

2609
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:25,039
of unnamed sources

2610
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:27,039
strip away the fluff

2611
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:30,479
and what you have left is essentially

2612
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:32,719
the benewit story all over again

2613
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:34,718
there is no question in my mind that

2614
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,480
it's mostly disinformation pure and

2615
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:38,239
simple

2616
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:40,879
and since i know

2617
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:43,919
that connections exist

2618
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:46,800
between those who are spreading it now

2619
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,639
and those who are spreading it then

2620
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:51,679
both from the benewits angle and from

2621
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:53,840
within the intelligence community

2622
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,600
it seems reasonable to conclude

2623
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,639
that those responsible

2624
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,639
for it

2625
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:02,000
are not satisfied their task has been

2626
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:03,760
completed even after all this time

2627
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,760
knowing what is going on however is

2628
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:09,199
simply not enough

2629
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,199
the real question is why

2630
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:13,599
it was just that question i asked myself

2631
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,639
when i first ran into the disinformation

2632
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:18,960
operation that was being run on benowitz

2633
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:22,719
it seemed to me at that time

2634
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:24,399
that i was in a rather unique position

2635
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,319
there i was

2636
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:28,319
with my foot literally in the door of a

2637
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:30,158
secret counter intelligence game that

2638
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:32,479
gave every appearance of being somehow

2639
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:35,519
directly connected to a high-level

2640
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:37,039
government ufo project

2641
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,880
and judging by the positions of the

2642
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:40,158
people i knew to be directly involved

2643
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,840
with it

2644
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,479
definitely had something to do with

2645
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,960
national security

2646
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:49,599
there was no way i was going to allow

2647
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,198
the opportunity to pass me by

2648
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:54,320
without learning at least something

2649
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:54,319
about what was going on

2650
01:48:55,679 --> 01:49:00,800
many ufologists have run up against this

2651
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:02,719
information over the years

2652
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,880
virtually all of them viewed it as a

2653
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:07,279
negative process and backed away from it

2654
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,639
either in anger or disgust

2655
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:11,039
as soon as they discovered what they

2656
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,719
were dealing with

2657
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:15,118
even today

2658
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,960
the ufo community unanimously considers

2659
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:20,399
anyone known or suspected dealing in

2660
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:22,239
disinformation to be one of the bad guys

2661
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,879
someone to be shunned or avoided at all

2662
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:26,959
costs and certainly never ever to be

2663
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,719
believed

2664
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,960
i on the other hand determined to take

2665
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:34,158
quite a different tack

2666
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:36,239
i would play the disinformation game

2667
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:38,079
get my hands dirty just often enough to

2668
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,238
lead those directing the process into

2669
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:42,399
believing that i was doing exactly what

2670
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:44,479
they wanted me to do

2671
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:46,158
and all the while

2672
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:47,839
continue to burrow my way into the

2673
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:50,799
matrix so as to learn as much as

2674
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,800
possible about who was directing it and

2675
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,880
why

2676
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:57,119
it would be a classic case

2677
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,719
of turning the tables on the very ones

2678
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:02,158
who were most confident that they had

2679
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:04,239
the situation well in hand

2680
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:06,479
there was just one thing i needed to do

2681
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:08,000
this

2682
01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:10,399
secrecy

2683
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,960
i couldn't tell anyone

2684
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:14,319
about what i was doing

2685
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,760
or if i did

2686
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:19,679
and word got back to those in control

2687
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:23,440
i would be immediately cut off and cast

2688
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,440
adrift before i could learn anything

2689
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:28,239
it was a formidable problem

2690
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:30,000
some of the contacts i had made during

2691
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:31,919
the benowitz affair seemed friendly and

2692
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,679
professed a desire to end the ufo

2693
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,599
cover-up and assist in getting

2694
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:38,079
government information on ufos out to

2695
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:41,440
the public in a slow and methodical

2696
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:43,840
manner so as not to create panic

2697
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:46,000
others seem more interested in obtaining

2698
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,920
information from me

2699
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,599
often on what other members of the ufo

2700
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,359
community were doing

2701
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:53,920
and sometimes on other completely

2702
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:55,759
unrelated subjects

2703
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,000
whatever information i managed to get

2704
01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:00,000
from these individuals in return

2705
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,679
usually came as a result of asking just

2706
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,599
the right questions in just the right

2707
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,079
ways

2708
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,760
sometimes it took months or even years

2709
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:10,479
of establishing a relationship with

2710
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:13,520
someone before anyone useful came for

2711
01:51:10,479 --> 01:51:15,359
anything useful came from it

2712
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:17,520
the most difficult difficult part of it

2713
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:17,519
all

2714
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:23,199
was trying to determine what was real

2715
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:23,198
and what was

2716
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:27,679
one of the key factors in any successful

2717
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:30,400
disinformation scheme

2718
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:33,920
is that it must contain some elements of

2719
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:36,719
truth in order to make it credible

2720
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:40,158
knowing that however is one thing

2721
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:41,760
doing something with it is quite another

2722
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:44,479
when you're dealing with what you know

2723
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:46,159
to be a classified program

2724
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:47,839
and you're determined to get information

2725
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,079
without breaking any laws and running

2726
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:53,279
afoul of national security

2727
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:55,198
you're walking a very fine line

2728
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:57,920
and that's why it takes a long time to

2729
01:51:55,198 --> 01:51:57,919
get results

2730
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:02,479
in june of 1982

2731
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,119
i approached my friend jamie chanderay

2732
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:06,559
and brought him into the project

2733
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,960
at that time

2734
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,960
i also began briefing stanton as to what

2735
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,319
was going on

2736
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,079
both of them knew

2737
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:15,920
that i was in contact with a number of

2738
01:52:14,079 --> 01:52:18,399
people within the intelligence community

2739
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,480
on the subject of ufos

2740
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:22,319
and both were aware

2741
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:25,198
that at least some of the information

2742
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:27,118
coming through was disinformation

2743
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:29,039
but both only had minimal knowledge of

2744
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:32,319
the private goals and conclusions i had

2745
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:34,399
established some months earlier

2746
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:36,158
as the project progressed this actually

2747
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:37,920
turned out to be more of an asset than a

2748
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:39,839
drawback

2749
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,520
indeed the three of us were an excellent

2750
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,960
team in that we each approached the

2751
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:46,719
problem from a different angle

2752
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,719
from my point of view the process was

2753
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,599
one of slowly and methodically burrowing

2754
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:53,359
into a beehive from the outside with the

2755
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:56,800
goal of ultimately reaching the queen

2756
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:58,559
bee in the royal jelly at the center

2757
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,320
since i never knew whether the other

2758
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,320
bees i was certain to meet along the way

2759
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:04,158
would be friendly or not

2760
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:06,880
i had to proceed cautiously both in

2761
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:08,638
order to avoid getting stung

2762
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,279
and to learn as much as possible about

2763
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:14,400
what what might lie ahead

2764
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:16,319
the control factor as i saw it

2765
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,479
rested largely with me and the way i

2766
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:20,158
proceeded

2767
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:22,638
jamie on the other hand saw it as a

2768
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:24,399
somewhat different process

2769
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:26,079
he too felt we were burrowing into a

2770
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:28,000
beehive

2771
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:29,679
but in his view of things our burrowing

2772
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,079
was at the express invitation of the

2773
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:34,319
queen bee herself

2774
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:36,319
who clandestinely oversaw and encouraged

2775
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:38,319
the process from a distance

2776
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,238
as part of her private plan to get free

2777
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,519
of politics that surrounds and restrains

2778
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:43,598
her

2779
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,760
as long as we follow the signposts along

2780
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:48,000
the way jaime felt

2781
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:50,960
the learning process would continue

2782
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,800
and we could never get stung

2783
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,800
stanton as the scientist of the group

2784
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:56,239
was the one best qualified to conduct a

2785
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,560
careful and organized search for

2786
01:53:56,238 --> 01:54:00,319
corroborating witnesses and evidence in

2787
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,159
places outside of the loop jamie and i

2788
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:04,799
were part of

2789
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:06,559
and by the way

2790
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:09,840
just as a matter of personal privilege

2791
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:11,520
here i would like to react to a nasty

2792
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,360
comment about stanton which appeared in

2793
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:16,080
a recent issue of jim mosley's saucer

2794
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:17,759
smear newsletter

2795
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,760
in this comment

2796
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,800
the writer after first characterizing

2797
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,320
stanton as a gullible individual

2798
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,880
went on to wonder whether he could be

2799
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:28,319
trusted to expose the mj-12 documents as

2800
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,760
phony if his research turned up

2801
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:33,840
conclusive evidence to that effect

2802
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,440
it's a legitimate question

2803
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,560
and i'd like to answer it by stating

2804
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:40,479
that not only stanton but all of us

2805
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:43,119
are firmly committed to releasing a full

2806
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:44,479
and complete report on this matter

2807
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:47,439
if evidence should come to light

2808
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:51,118
suggesting that the documents are phony

2809
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:53,118
you have my firm assurance

2810
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:55,118
that it will most certainly be

2811
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:56,399
included in the report

2812
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:59,598
gullibility

2813
01:54:56,399 --> 01:55:03,359
is not an issue here

2814
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:05,599
the matter is far larger than that

2815
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:08,158
in any case stanton jamie and i are all

2816
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:10,319
working toward the same goal

2817
01:55:08,158 --> 01:55:12,000
that of trying to discover what is truth

2818
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:15,599
and what isn't

2819
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,439
with respect to the government and ufos

2820
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:19,199
my role in the benowitz affair had at

2821
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:20,960
least secured me a seat in the right

2822
01:55:19,198 --> 01:55:22,000
theater

2823
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:23,599
from there

2824
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,679
it was only a question of whether i

2825
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,199
could use my balcony ticket to discover

2826
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:30,639
who owned the place and was making the

2827
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:30,638
major operational decisions

2828
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:34,960
both jamie and i felt that in order to

2829
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:36,960
have any hope of success at all

2830
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:40,000
we absolutely had to play the game

2831
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:41,760
according to their rules

2832
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,118
that meant doing everything possible to

2833
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,520
give the appearance that we were

2834
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:47,439
essentially useful idiots

2835
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,119
who would cause no trouble while at the

2836
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:51,279
same time playing the double game of

2837
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:52,880
keeping our eyes and ears open in order

2838
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:54,960
to learn as much as we could about what

2839
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,719
was going on

2840
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,639
in so doing

2841
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:01,039
we were gradually able to expand our

2842
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:02,480
base of friendly contact people

2843
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:04,000
while working our way further and

2844
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:06,399
further into the truly bizarre

2845
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,118
intelligence labyrinth that surrounds

2846
01:56:06,399 --> 01:56:10,799
the subject of ufos

2847
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:13,679
i have no problem in telling you that

2848
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:16,239
it's been a tedious time and resource

2849
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:18,560
consuming task which has been made all

2850
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:21,039
the more difficult by the constant

2851
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,719
barrage of rocks hoots and bottles

2852
01:56:21,039 --> 01:56:25,039
thrown in our direction from a segment

2853
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:27,279
of the ufo community which out of

2854
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:29,599
ignorance chose up to take on chose to

2855
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:32,639
take up unfriendly and unsympathetic

2856
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:34,159
positions toward us

2857
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:36,000
were it not for the fact that we were

2858
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:38,158
constantly challenged by the twists and

2859
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,679
turns of our project and by the hope

2860
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:41,839
that we could ultimately come away from

2861
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:43,118
it with a smoking gun in hand i'm

2862
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,840
convinced we would have thrown in the

2863
01:56:43,118 --> 01:56:47,359
towel a long time ago

2864
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,039
indeed i must admit that there were

2865
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:50,559
several occasions when we tried to do

2866
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:52,399
just that

2867
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,639
only to be encouraged to continue by

2868
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:55,920
some of our friends from the inside who

2869
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:59,679
had come to believe in what we were

2870
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:01,760
doing and respected us for it

2871
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:05,118
the anonymous arrival of the so-called

2872
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:07,039
mj-12 documents in december of 1984 was

2873
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:10,319
another factor we had to contend with in

2874
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:12,399
this increasingly confusing web

2875
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:15,759
the problem of their origin

2876
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:17,519
and authenticity was and remains

2877
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:19,599
a major issue

2878
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,679
and on this point

2879
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:24,880
our position of neutrality has

2880
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:26,158
constantly been misinterpreted

2881
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:28,319
therefore

2882
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:30,960
for the record

2883
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,639
it is important to point out here once

2884
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:35,359
again

2885
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:37,920
that at no time have either i or any of

2886
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:41,279
my associates ever stated that these

2887
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:43,440
documents are authentic

2888
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:45,439
our position has consistently been that

2889
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:46,879
we do not know whether they are

2890
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:49,039
authentic

2891
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,159
but that we as investigators remain

2892
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:52,560
unaware

2893
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:55,439
of any convincing evidence which would

2894
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:57,199
suggest that they are not

2895
01:57:55,439 --> 01:57:59,118
that position remains essentially

2896
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:00,638
unchanged today

2897
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:02,880
and i'll have more to say about it when

2898
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:05,279
i get to the end of this paper

2899
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:07,679
the bottom line however

2900
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:11,118
is that authentic or not

2901
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:13,599
the story of the documents is a major

2902
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:13,598
story

2903
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:18,158
and one which as i've already assured

2904
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:20,960
you will ultimately be told

2905
01:58:18,158 --> 01:58:22,799
when the time is ready to tell it

2906
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,639
that process has already taken

2907
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,480
considerably longer than i had thought

2908
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:28,079
it would

2909
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:30,158
i cannot predict when it will be

2910
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:32,559
complete but i can say that progress has

2911
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:34,399
been made

2912
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,199
and i for one certainly hope it won't be

2913
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:37,198
too much longer

2914
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:42,239
for the many of you

2915
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:44,399
who have roundly criticized our

2916
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:46,479
methodology throughout the mj-12

2917
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:47,679
controversy it seems important to note

2918
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:49,759
here

2919
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:52,399
that what you were witnessing

2920
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:54,400
was the operation of a plan

2921
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:57,118
to put out just enough of this bizarre

2922
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:59,039
information to attract attention

2923
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:00,799
and then carefully monitor who showed up

2924
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:03,760
with questions to ask

2925
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:05,599
or information to offer

2926
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,360
once again

2927
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,199
i was careful to state that i remained

2928
01:59:07,359 --> 01:59:11,439
unconvinced of the authenticity of the

2929
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:13,279
information involved

2930
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:15,678
in the case of the falcon and condor

2931
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:17,679
interviews broadcast last october on ufo

2932
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:20,079
cover up live

2933
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:22,000
i'm convinced that at least some of that

2934
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:24,399
information falls under the category of

2935
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,800
disinformation

2936
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:29,039
i'm equally convinced that some of it is

2937
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,039
true

2938
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:34,158
the important point here is

2939
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:36,479
that regardless of whether it is

2940
01:59:34,158 --> 01:59:37,839
disinformation or truth

2941
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:40,638
it does

2942
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:43,279
have to do with ufos

2943
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:45,440
and the sources who provided it

2944
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:47,679
felt that doing so was important enough

2945
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:51,279
to risk going before national television

2946
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:55,199
in order to accomplish that purpose

2947
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:57,039
remember also that those sources knew

2948
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:59,919
that falcon and condor would be

2949
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:01,118
identified on the show as confidential

2950
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,960
government

2951
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,279
informants

2952
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:07,279
the risk was all theirs

2953
02:00:05,279 --> 02:00:10,000
not out

2954
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:11,679
and still they went ahead

2955
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
just as they are currently going ahead

2956
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:15,440
with the process of arranging a meeting

2957
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,198
which will enable them to tell their

2958
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:19,678
stories before one or more members of

2959
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:19,678
congress

2960
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,840
i submit to you

2961
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:28,319
that such a process is

2962
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:31,039
extraordinary regardless

2963
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:32,880
of the truth or deception involved

2964
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:34,639
and i think it's high time the ufo

2965
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:38,400
community stopped throwing rocks at it

2966
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:38,400
and began to consider the implications

2967
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:43,840
one thing i can assure you

2968
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:46,719
is that rocks are not

2969
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,560
our project will continue

2970
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:50,880
you can either become involved as others

2971
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:54,080
in the ufo community have done

2972
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:56,319
or you can sit back and wait for results

2973
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:57,760
whatever those results good bad positive

2974
02:00:56,319 --> 02:01:00,479
or negative

2975
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:02,400
you will hear about them

2976
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,238
our trolling of the bait by means of a

2977
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,079
progressive release of information and

2978
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,079
ultimately by arranging for falcon and

2979
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:09,198
condor to appear on the ufo cover-up

2980
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:10,880
live show

2981
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:13,359
produced a variety of interesting

2982
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,440
results

2983
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:17,439
shortly after the show

2984
02:01:15,439 --> 02:01:19,759
the fbi showed up and began asking

2985
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:21,598
questions about it

2986
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:23,119
they even arranged for a private showing

2987
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:24,880
in the office of producer michael

2988
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:26,799
seligman

2989
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,480
agents on both east and west coasts

2990
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:31,840
interviewed a number of ufologists and

2991
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:33,439
other people including jamie chanderay

2992
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:36,159
but although i let it be known that i'd

2993
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:38,479
be more than happy to talk to them they

2994
02:01:36,158 --> 02:01:40,000
avoided me

2995
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:41,598
this i found to be particularly

2996
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,399
interesting in light of the fbi's

2997
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:46,079
admission in response to a foyer request

2998
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:48,079
that they have nearly 60 pages of

2999
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:51,359
material on me that is all classified

3000
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:54,319
for reasons of national security

3001
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:56,238
that was in july of 1988

3002
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:58,559
i still have no idea what those pages

3003
02:01:56,238 --> 02:01:58,559
contain

3004
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:02,480
another thing that occurred as we had

3005
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:04,239
hoped it would

3006
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:05,678
was that a rather small number of people

3007
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:07,359
came out of the woodwork claiming to

3008
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:09,760
have inside knowledge of one type or

3009
02:02:07,359 --> 02:02:12,960
another about mj-12 or similar

3010
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:15,039
government ufo projects

3011
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,719
after weeding out the obvious cranks and

3012
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:19,439
several others whose claims did not

3013
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:21,840
check out or whose or whose stories

3014
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:23,439
changed every time they told them

3015
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,440
we were left with a few leads which

3016
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:27,359
seemed promising

3017
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:28,799
it's premature to offer you a report on

3018
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:30,839
these at this time

3019
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,119
because we're still

3020
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,199
checking also

3021
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:37,759
seemingly in direct relationship to our

3022
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:39,279
partial release of mj 12 material two

3023
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,079
years ago

3024
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:43,599
the flow of ufo-related disinformation

3025
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:46,399
has escalated

3026
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:50,400
from a point of near insignificance to

3027
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:52,238
what has become almost a flood tide

3028
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:53,839
indeed many of you in the audience came

3029
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:55,519
here tonight looking for answers to

3030
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:57,840
questions related directly to that

3031
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,840
problem

3032
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:05,199
as i have taken great pains to point out

3033
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:07,439
the current crop of disinformation is

3034
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:09,198
really nothing new

3035
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:12,559
it's just that a different crop of

3036
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:15,598
people are spreading it this time around

3037
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:17,520
i expect that those responsible

3038
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:19,840
not the rumor mongers themselves but the

3039
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:21,520
ones who are feeding them

3040
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,840
thought it would work just as well this

3041
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,920
time as it did last

3042
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,039
the one thing i'm sure they didn't count

3043
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,880
on

3044
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:31,599
is that i would tell my story and thus

3045
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,599
blow their cover

3046
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:36,359
and speaking of blowing cover

3047
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:45,920
[Music]

3048
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:45,920
and speaking of blowing cover

3049
02:03:48,939 --> 02:03:52,079
[Music]

3050
02:03:53,439 --> 02:03:58,399
and speaking of blowing cover i think

3051
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,239
it's high time that i tell you what i

3052
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:02,000
know about another situation that has

3053
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:05,439
found its way into the current crop of

3054
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,439
ufo disinformation

3055
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,000
i offer this not to embarrass the person

3056
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
involved

3057
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,319
but rather to shed light on an incident

3058
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,560
which by the accounts of it

3059
02:04:14,319 --> 02:04:18,399
have appeared recently in a variety of

3060
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:22,360
ufo newsletters

3061
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:22,359
and at least one new book

3062
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:31,039
aztec rumor

3063
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:34,639
rick indicated he do nothing about the

3064
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:36,158
matter

3065
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:38,239
and asked me to tell him everything i

3066
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:39,759
could

3067
02:04:38,238 --> 02:04:43,519
i did so

3068
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,520
and as i recall he took some notes

3069
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:47,199
we discussed a number of other things as

3070
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:48,960
well

3071
02:04:47,198 --> 02:04:51,279
some months later

3072
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:53,198
in early 1983

3073
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:55,118
i became aware that rick was involved

3074
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:56,879
with a team of several others

3075
02:04:55,118 --> 02:04:59,198
including one fellow from denver that i

3076
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:01,279
knew of and at least one who was working

3077
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:03,598
out of washington dc

3078
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:04,559
in playing an elaborate disinformation

3079
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:06,480
game

3080
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:09,039
against a prominent cattle mutilation

3081
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:10,638
researcher who at the time

3082
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:12,479
had close connections with a major

3083
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:16,000
television film company interested in

3084
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:17,759
doing a ufo documentary

3085
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,639
although i was not in a position to know

3086
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:23,520
everything about what was going on

3087
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:25,279
i had access to enough of it to conclude

3088
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:27,040
that the government seemed hell-bent on

3089
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:30,319
severing the ties that existed between

3090
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:32,560
the researcher in the film company

3091
02:05:30,319 --> 02:05:34,238
my understanding was

3092
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:36,400
that because the researcher was known to

3093
02:05:34,238 --> 02:05:38,078
have close ties to benowitz

3094
02:05:36,399 --> 02:05:39,598
and had exhibited a strong interest in

3095
02:05:38,078 --> 02:05:41,359
his work

3096
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:43,279
certain elements within the intelligence

3097
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:44,479
community were concerned that the story

3098
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:46,559
of his having intercepted

3099
02:05:44,479 --> 02:05:49,118
electromagnetic emissions

3100
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,880
from the kirtland sandia area would end

3101
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:53,039
up as part of the script of a feature

3102
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,719
film

3103
02:05:53,039 --> 02:05:55,760
since this in turn might influence

3104
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,679
others

3105
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:59,280
possibly even the soviets

3106
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:00,800
to obtain to attempt similar

3107
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:02,238
interceptions

3108
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,840
someone in a controlled position

3109
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:06,638
apparently felt it had to be stopped

3110
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,400
before it got out of hand

3111
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:10,159
in any case the prime objective of the

3112
02:06:08,399 --> 02:06:13,439
counter-intelligence people who swarmed

3113
02:06:10,158 --> 02:06:14,719
around venues between 1980 and 84

3114
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,799
seemed to be the maintenance of a

3115
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:20,000
high-level security net around the radio

3116
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:22,000
signals he was intercepting

3117
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,319
i was unable to determine why this was a

3118
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,599
priority at the time

3119
02:06:24,319 --> 02:06:29,279
and i still do not know today

3120
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:30,800
what i do know however

3121
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:32,399
is that since they couldn't physically

3122
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,920
stop paul from intercepting these

3123
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:35,759
signals

3124
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,319
and since they hadn't been successful in

3125
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:39,679
enlisting his voluntary silence

3126
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:41,359
they fell back on a wall of

3127
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:44,319
disinformation

3128
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:46,158
as the best way to confuse the issue and

3129
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:48,078
ultimately to call his credibility into

3130
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:50,559
question

3131
02:06:48,078 --> 02:06:52,238
when the filmmaker appeared on the scene

3132
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:54,239
and it looked as if paul's story might

3133
02:06:52,238 --> 02:06:56,000
become part of the script

3134
02:06:54,238 --> 02:06:58,000
the counterintelligence people simply

3135
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,158
extended their disinformation activities

3136
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
accordingly

3137
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:03,839
part of this game involved a meeting

3138
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,960
between the cattle mutilation researcher

3139
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,639
in question

3140
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,118
agent richard doty

3141
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:11,279
and others at the afosi office of

3142
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:12,880
kirkland air force base wherein the

3143
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:14,639
researchers subsequently claimed to have

3144
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,400
been allowed to view certain purportedly

3145
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:17,679
sensitive documents

3146
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:20,879
about the government's alleged

3147
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:22,480
involvement with ufos

3148
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,560
part of this material included

3149
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:27,439
information about an alleged ufo crash

3150
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:29,039
retrieval at aztec

3151
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,359
richard doty

3152
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:33,118
who's bound by a security oath cannot

3153
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:34,319
and i am told will not discuss this

3154
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:36,158
matter

3155
02:07:34,319 --> 02:07:39,039
except to say that he broke no laws and

3156
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:41,439
gave away no secrets that day

3157
02:07:39,039 --> 02:07:43,118
that in so far as i'm aware is entirely

3158
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:45,439
correct

3159
02:07:43,118 --> 02:07:47,598
i on the other hand was never required

3160
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:49,598
to sign a security oath

3161
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:51,599
and therefore breaking no laws when i

3162
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:53,520
tell you quite candidly

3163
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:55,440
that the information which changed hands

3164
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,760
on that day was directly descended from

3165
02:07:55,439 --> 02:08:00,238
the discussion doty and i had had only a

3166
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,000
few months earlier

3167
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,759
i can also tell you that it was a very

3168
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,198
effective deception

3169
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:07,599
because the researcher involved

3170
02:08:05,198 --> 02:08:09,118
continues to believe this information

3171
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:11,360
and actively continues to try to

3172
02:08:09,118 --> 02:08:14,639
convince others of its truth even now

3173
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:17,039
more than six years after the fact

3174
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:18,480
unfortunately there was no ufo crash at

3175
02:08:17,039 --> 02:08:20,078
aztec

3176
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:21,439
nor was there much truth to any of the

3177
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:23,279
other materials applied to this

3178
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:25,118
particular researcher

3179
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,800
either at that meeting or during later

3180
02:08:25,118 --> 02:08:28,799
encounters

3181
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:31,279
the much touted alien harvest is really

3182
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,440
a dismal crop failure

3183
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:35,198
to the best of my knowledge it was all

3184
02:08:33,439 --> 02:08:37,198
disinformation

3185
02:08:35,198 --> 02:08:39,198
and i was the unfortunate one who had

3186
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:41,519
unwittingly supplied the fuel to those

3187
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:43,678
who were spreading the fire

3188
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,920
i've held my silence on this matter for

3189
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:48,960
more than six years

3190
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:48,960
now you know the truth

3191
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:54,078
disinformation

3192
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:55,920
disinformation is a strange and bizarre

3193
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:57,759
game

3194
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,920
those who play it are completely aware

3195
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:02,719
that an operations success is dependent

02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:05,359
upon dropping information upon a target

3197
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:07,198
or mark in such a way that the person

3198
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:09,118
will accept it as truth

3199
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:12,319
and will repeat and even defend it to

3200
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:12,319
others as if it were true

3201
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:17,439
once this has been accomplished

3202
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:21,069
we certainly have a number of rude

3203
02:09:17,439 --> 02:09:23,759
people in this audience that's too bad

3204
02:09:21,069 --> 02:09:25,599
[Music]

3205
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:27,520
once this has been accomplished the work

3206
02:09:25,599 --> 02:09:29,119
of the counter-intelligence specialist

3207
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,639
is complete

3208
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:32,078
they can simply withdraw in the

3209
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:33,760
confidence that the dirty work of

3210
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:36,158
spreading their poisoned seeds will be

3211
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:37,679
done by others

3212
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:40,879
those who want proof of how well the

3213
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:43,118
process works need only look around you

3214
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:45,679
every time one of you

3215
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:47,839
repeats an unverified or unsubstantiated

3216
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:49,440
bit of information without qualifying it

3217
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:51,920
as such

3218
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:54,000
you are contributing to that process

3219
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:55,920
and every time you do it

3220
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,359
somebody in a need to know position sits

3221
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:59,440
back and has a horse laugh at your

3222
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:01,679
expense

3223
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:03,118
one final comment on the aztec hoax is

3224
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:05,599
that two other individuals who

3225
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:07,759
self-published a voluminous book

3226
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:10,719
ufo crash at aztec

3227
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:13,760
on the affair in 1987

3228
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:16,158
chose to completely omit any any mention

3229
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:17,599
of my extensive research on the case

3230
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:19,198
which had been published two years

3231
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:23,039
earlier

3232
02:10:19,198 --> 02:10:24,719
in which both researchers had copies of

3233
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:26,960
it's a classic case of the book's

3234
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,800
principal author having decided that his

3235
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,920
conclusion with what his conclusion

3236
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,679
would be

3237
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,359
before even beginning the process of

3238
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:34,639
investigating

3239
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:36,880
and then ignoring everything which

3240
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:38,719
didn't fit

3241
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:40,719
one of the problems the ufology movement

3242
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:42,239
has with its image

3243
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:44,000
is that there are a significant number

3244
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:45,519
of people involved with it

3245
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,960
who not only support this sort of

3246
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:52,880
journalism but encourage it

3247
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:52,880
the next section of this presentation

3248
02:10:53,279 --> 02:10:58,399
will deal with questions and answers but

3249
02:10:55,198 --> 02:10:59,759
the format will be a bit different

3250
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:01,920
in that i will

3251
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:04,320
not take questions from the audience but

3252
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:06,239
have elected to incorporate a number of

3253
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:10,158
questions and their answers

3254
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:13,118
directly into the body of this paper

3255
02:11:10,158 --> 02:11:15,598
question number one

3256
02:11:13,118 --> 02:11:17,759
am i currently involved with providing

3257
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:19,760
information to any government agency

3258
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:21,920
about ufos

3259
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:23,440
or about people involved with the ufo

3260
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,199
phenomena

3261
02:11:23,439 --> 02:11:26,238
the answer

3262
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:28,319
no

3263
02:11:26,238 --> 02:11:32,439
i have not had any such involvement

3264
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:32,439
since nineteen eighty four

3265
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:51,359
frankly i'm a little ashamed

3266
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,199
of some people in this audience

3267
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:56,759
regardless of what you believe what you

3268
02:11:53,198 --> 02:11:56,759
hear or not

3269
02:12:06,238 --> 02:12:11,439
this is not a debate

3270
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:14,800
it is a paper trying to be presented now

3271
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:14,799
please show a little courtesy

3272
02:12:15,039 --> 02:12:18,198
thank you

3273
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:27,279
i'll repeat that question

3274
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:31,599
am i currently involved with providing

3275
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:33,520
information to any government agency

3276
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:35,440
about ufos

3277
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:37,760
are about people involved with the ufo

3278
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:40,000
phenomenon

3279
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,199
answer

3280
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,039
no

3281
02:12:41,198 --> 02:12:45,598
i have not had any such involvement

3282
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:46,960
since 1984

3283
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:49,599
the extent

3284
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:51,279
and the scope of that involvement

3285
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:55,039
were essentially as i have already

3286
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:55,039
outlined to you and nothing more

3287
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,078
question two

3288
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:01,920
am i presently involved in knowingly

3289
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:04,960
spreading any sort of disinformation

3290
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,960
about ufos

3291
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:08,399
answer

3292
02:13:07,039 --> 02:13:10,560
no

3293
02:13:08,399 --> 02:13:12,238
the only conscious involvement i have

3294
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:14,960
ever had

3295
02:13:12,238 --> 02:13:16,879
with a disinformation operation

3296
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:20,480
was that which i have already outlined

3297
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:20,480
in connection with the bennowitz case

3298
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:26,319
question three

3299
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:29,118
am i presently or have i ever been on

3300
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:31,840
the payroll of any agency of the us

3301
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:31,839
government

3302
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,158
no

3303
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:39,440
question four

3304
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:43,960
what about my involvement

3305
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:43,960
with ufo researcher lee graham

3306
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:48,719
answer

3307
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:50,880
earlier in this paper

3308
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:53,039
i told you of how i was recruited to

3309
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,760
supply information on mr benowitz in

3310
02:13:53,039 --> 02:13:59,198
1980

3311
02:13:55,760 --> 02:14:01,920
the exact wording in my statement was

3312
02:13:59,198 --> 02:14:04,638
benowitz and to a lesser extent several

3313
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,560
other individuals

3314
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:08,639
one of those other individuals was lee

3315
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:12,800
graham

3316
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:14,400
this began in 1983 if memory serves

3317
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:16,719
it's important to note here that in

3318
02:14:14,399 --> 02:14:21,279
addition to being a ufo researcher lee

3319
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:21,279
is also an avid military aircraft buff

3320
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:26,000
as far as i'm aware

3321
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:28,000
the counterintelligence people were

3322
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,359
primarily interested in him because at

3323
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,679
the time

3324
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:33,039
lee was making a lot of inquiries

3325
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:34,399
and collecting a great deal of

3326
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:36,319
information

3327
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:39,439
on the then very highly classified

3328
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:41,198
stealth aircraft program

3329
02:14:39,439 --> 02:14:42,879
apparently there was some question as to

3330
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:46,078
why he was so interested in obtaining

3331
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:47,440
information on so sensitive the subject

3332
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:49,519
in other words

3333
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:52,000
was he using it solely to satisfy a

3334
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,760
personal curiosity

3335
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,279
or was he passing it on to others who

3336
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,880
perhaps had foreign intelligence

3337
02:14:55,279 --> 02:14:58,800
connections

3338
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:02,159
there seemed to be only minimal interest

3339
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:03,760
in his ufo activities

3340
02:15:02,158 --> 02:15:05,439
lee is a completely above board

3341
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:08,480
individual

3342
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:10,158
who is a loyal u.s citizen

3343
02:15:08,479 --> 02:15:12,559
in the process of keeping in touch with

3344
02:15:10,158 --> 02:15:14,238
him we became good friends

3345
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:15,760
his knowledge of the fact that i had

3346
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:17,519
friends in the intelligence community

3347
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:19,039
gradually evolved into the firm belief

3348
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:23,119
on his part

3349
02:15:19,039 --> 02:15:25,279
that i was much more than i really was

3350
02:15:23,118 --> 02:15:29,439
the id card story which has become the

3351
02:15:25,279 --> 02:15:29,439
subject of so much speculation lately

3352
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:34,960
stems from nothing more than a practical

3353
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:36,479
joke which has simply gotten out of hand

3354
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,319
since the story surrounding it is

3355
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:39,439
somewhat longer than the time here will

3356
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:42,000
allow

3357
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:43,839
i will commit to publishing it later in

3358
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,439
our newsletter so that it will be on

3359
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,360
record for anyone interested in the

3360
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:48,879
facts

3361
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:52,479
the fact is

3362
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:55,279
i do not hold the government id card

3363
02:15:52,479 --> 02:15:56,799
but think about it for just one moment

3364
02:15:55,279 --> 02:15:58,399
if i did

3365
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:00,880
does it make sense that i'd pull it out

3366
02:15:58,399 --> 02:16:05,238
of my wallet and show it to lee graham

3367
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:05,239
or anybody else for that matter

3368
02:16:06,078 --> 02:16:09,198
question five

3369
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:11,199
is it true

3370
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:12,799
that several hours of interviews with

3371
02:16:11,198 --> 02:16:14,319
the source code named falcon were

3372
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,400
videotaped

3373
02:16:14,319 --> 02:16:18,880
some in the presence of voter bonafide

3374
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:20,879
members of the news media

3375
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,800
and is it true

3376
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,800
as some have alleged

3377
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:27,599
that those tapes were confiscated by the

3378
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:27,599
u.s government

3379
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:31,279
answered

3380
02:16:29,118 --> 02:16:32,638
yes it is true that those tapes were

3381
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:34,879
made

3382
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:36,959
and no it is not true that they were

3383
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:39,839
confiscated they are still

3384
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:39,839
in our possession

3385
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:44,000
question six

3386
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:48,159
is it true that i've characterized the

3387
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,159
cattle mutilation phenomenon as a hoax

3388
02:16:48,318 --> 02:16:51,760
answer

3389
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:51,760
no

3390
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,599
question seven

3391
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:57,920
do i know anything about the so-called

3392
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:58,840
ellsworth air force base humanoid case

3393
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:01,679
of

3394
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:03,599
1977 and the documents associated with

3395
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:04,719
it

3396
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:06,318
answered

3397
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:08,239
yes

3398
02:17:06,318 --> 02:17:09,920
some people have characterized this case

3399
02:17:08,239 --> 02:17:11,519
as a hoax while others have attributed

3400
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,318
to attributed it to official

3401
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:16,398
disinformation

3402
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:19,679
it's my position that this was a special

3403
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:21,840
counter intelligence training exercise

3404
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:24,079
in the creation and dissemination of

3405
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:25,439
disinformation

3406
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:27,039
and yes

3407
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:28,719
richard doty who was stationed at

3408
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,880
ellsworth at the time

3409
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:32,718
was clearly a part of it

3410
02:17:30,879 --> 02:17:34,398
but not in any capacity where he would

3411
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:37,518
have been responsible for creating the

3412
02:17:34,398 --> 02:17:37,519
documents involved

3413
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:41,439
question 8

3414
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:44,239
do i know anything about the so-called

3415
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,239
white soul letter

3416
02:17:44,799 --> 02:17:48,159
answer yes

3417
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,160
the letter

3418
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:51,920
which is loosely based upon an actual

3419
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:54,398
ufo case

3420
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:58,000
was written anonymously to apro in july

3421
02:17:54,398 --> 02:17:59,760
of 1980 by richard cody

3422
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,599
is directly related to the benowitz

3423
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:04,159
affair

3424
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:06,719
essentially it was bait

3425
02:18:04,159 --> 02:18:09,599
afosi knew that benowitz had close ties

3426
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:10,959
with the apro organization at the time

3427
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:13,439
they were interested in recruiting

3428
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:14,879
someone within the organization would be

3429
02:18:13,439 --> 02:18:16,880
in a position to provide them with

3430
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:19,438
feedback on benowitz's activities and

3431
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:22,959
communications

3432
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:24,559
since i was an april board member

3433
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:26,239
the whites of letter was passed to me

3434
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:27,840
for action shortly after it had been

3435
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:29,599
received

3436
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:31,599
it was not long thereafter that i came

3437
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:32,960
to know richard doty

3438
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:36,880
and began to provide him with

3439
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:39,839
information about benowitz and his case

3440
02:18:36,879 --> 02:18:39,839
question nine

3441
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,679
what do i know about the so-called

3442
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:45,200
aquarius document which purports to be a

3443
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:47,679
facsimile

3444
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:50,880
the fossi message

3445
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:52,558
with a few spurious additions

3446
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:55,039
i neither typed

3447
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:57,840
nor retyped this document

3448
02:18:55,040 --> 02:19:00,639
it was created by afosi

3449
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:04,318
or at least i always assumed it was

3450
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:06,000
and it was handed to me in february 1981

3451
02:19:04,318 --> 02:19:08,000
with the intention that i would pass it

3452
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,000
to benowitz

3453
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,079
my understanding although i never knew

3454
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,920
for sure

3455
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:15,599
was that benowitz was expected to wave

3456
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:17,040
it to the press and others as proof of

3457
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:18,478
what he was saying about an alien

3458
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,319
invasion

3459
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:22,318
at which point the document would be not

3460
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:23,519
denounced as a counterfeit

3461
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:25,439
and benowitz would be further

3462
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:27,120
discredited

3463
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:27,920
unfortunately

3464
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:30,000
or

3465
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:31,679
perhaps fortunately depending upon one's

3466
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,558
point of view

3467
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:36,960
it didn't turn out that way

3468
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:38,799
a highlighted version of this document

3469
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:40,718
showing the real information and the

3470
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:42,478
added information appears in the current

3471
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:44,159
issue of our newsletter

3472
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:45,920
which will be available at our table off

3473
02:19:44,159 --> 02:19:48,239
in the lobby

3474
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,600
i might also add that the entire text of

3475
02:19:48,239 --> 02:19:51,840
this speech

3476
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,840
is also in there

3477
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,200
one additional bit of information about

3478
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,799
this document

3479
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:59,280
is the way that it came to be known to

3480
02:19:56,799 --> 02:20:01,679
the ufo community

3481
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:03,600
in september of 1982

3482
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,200
insofar as i was aware there were only

3483
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:06,960
three copies of this document in

3484
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:10,079
existence

3485
02:20:06,959 --> 02:20:12,239
one of these i had given to benowitz

3486
02:20:10,079 --> 02:20:14,318
the second was in safekeeping

3487
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:17,840
and a third was in my briefcase during a

3488
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:19,439
trip which i had made to san francisco

3489
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,120
while there

3490
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:22,800
i had a morning meeting with a man who

3491
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:25,359
turned out later to be an associate of

3492
02:20:22,799 --> 02:20:27,199
ufologist peter gersten

3493
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:29,200
that same afternoon

3494
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:31,520
my car was broken into

3495
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:33,439
and the briefcase was stolen

3496
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:35,439
there is a police report by the way on

3497
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:37,359
file in san francisco

3498
02:20:35,439 --> 02:20:39,439
four months later a copy of that same

3499
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:41,680
document complete with annotations i had

3500
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:44,398
penciled on it turned up in the hands of

3501
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:46,639
none other than gersten himself

3502
02:20:44,398 --> 02:20:48,478
to this day i have never received a

3503
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:51,039
satisfactory explanation of how he

3504
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:51,039
obtained it

3505
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:55,920
question 10

3506
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:58,159
what about the afosi documents which

3507
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:00,318
speak of a 1980

3508
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:02,398
ufo landing near a nuclear storage

3509
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:04,639
facility within the kirtland air force

3510
02:21:02,398 --> 02:21:07,199
base complex

3511
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:10,159
are these documents more disinformation

3512
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:12,479
or are they authentic

3513
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:15,439
answer to the best of my knowledge

3514
02:21:12,478 --> 02:21:15,438
they are authentic

3515
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:19,359
question 11

3516
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:20,800
what about other documents which i've

3517
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:22,640
either alluded to having or have

3518
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:25,959
published portions of without providing

3519
02:21:22,639 --> 02:21:25,959
further details

3520
02:21:26,398 --> 02:21:30,478
answer

3521
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:33,519
there are a number of these and they

3522
02:21:30,478 --> 02:21:35,119
came to us in several different ways

3523
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:36,960
none of them however seem to have any

3524
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,720
direct connection to the benowit's case

3525
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,398
nor as far as i can tell was richard

3526
02:21:38,719 --> 02:21:42,719
dodie directly involved

3527
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:44,159
in supplying them to us

3528
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:45,679
whether they are legitimate or

3529
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:47,840
disinformation

3530
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:50,559
the more likely a combination of both is

3531
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:52,159
still a matter of question

3532
02:21:50,559 --> 02:21:54,000
once we have completed our study of

3533
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:56,879
these materials

3534
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,040
we will make them available as well

3535
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:01,358
our publication of expregated copies of

3536
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:02,880
some of this material also served a

3537
02:22:01,359 --> 02:22:06,159
definite purpose

3538
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:06,159
but that's another story

3539
02:22:06,639 --> 02:22:12,398
question number 12.

3540
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:14,000
ufo basher phil class has been the topic

3541
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:15,439
of a number of rumors lately to the

3542
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,359
effect that he's an active government

3543
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:20,559
disinformation agent

3544
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:20,559
what do i think about that

3545
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:25,439
answer mr class is a very distinct

3546
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,359
individual

3547
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:29,520
who has long been a close follower of my

3548
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:31,760
activities

3549
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,079
indeed i believe he was the only one out

3550
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:36,000
of the entire ufo community

3551
02:22:34,079 --> 02:22:38,159
who managed to figure out what i and my

3552
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,879
associates were up to

3553
02:22:38,159 --> 02:22:42,318
and it horrified him

3554
02:22:40,879 --> 02:22:44,318
in my opinion

3555
02:22:42,318 --> 02:22:45,840
the very idea that someone might

3556
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:48,079
actually be capable of getting far

3557
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:50,559
enough into the ufo problem to unmask

3558
02:22:48,079 --> 02:22:52,159
his debunking claims constituted a

3559
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:53,920
personal threat to him that had to be

3560
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:55,359
dealt with

3561
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:57,040
he has been obsessed with doing

3562
02:22:55,359 --> 02:23:00,318
everything possible to try to either

3563
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:02,160
stop or discredit us ever since

3564
02:23:00,318 --> 02:23:03,439
the handout he passed around today to

3565
02:23:02,159 --> 02:23:06,639
many of you

3566
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:09,040
is just another example of it

3567
02:23:06,639 --> 02:23:11,358
as to his motives i think it's best left

3568
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:13,520
to mr class to explain why he behaves as

3569
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:15,840
he does

3570
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,439
perhaps phil bash's ufos and the people

3571
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:21,359
who see them for the same reason that

3572
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:21,359
other people tear the wings off of flies

3573
02:23:22,559 --> 02:23:26,719
or perhaps he gets well paid to do what

3574
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:28,879
he does

3575
02:23:26,719 --> 02:23:31,039
if there's nothing to ufos as he's

3576
02:23:28,879 --> 02:23:32,799
consistently claimed

3577
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:35,280
then i can't imagine why he gets so

3578
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:38,079
emotional about them

3579
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:38,079
unless of course

3580
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:46,000
unless of course it's all part of the

3581
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:48,239
script

3582
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,478
phil's been bashing ufos for over 20

3583
02:23:48,239 --> 02:23:52,398
years now

3584
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:54,639
in that process he's always been very

3585
02:23:52,398 --> 02:23:56,398
quick to ascribe ulterior motives to the

3586
02:23:54,639 --> 02:23:58,318
people who report them and investigate

3587
02:23:56,398 --> 02:23:59,439
them

3588
02:23:58,318 --> 02:24:00,959
there are a lot of people in this

3589
02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:04,559
audience would be very interested in

3590
02:24:00,959 --> 02:24:09,039
hearing what his ulterior motives are

3591
02:24:04,559 --> 02:24:10,799
why does mr clash class bash ufos

3592
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:12,319
i for one would welcome a rational

3593
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:14,318
explanation of just why a man would

3594
02:24:12,318 --> 02:24:16,159
devote 20 years of his life to an

3595
02:24:14,318 --> 02:24:20,079
essentially one-man crusade against

3596
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:20,079
something which he claims doesn't exist

3597
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:25,119
if he's not spreading disinformation

3598
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:26,880
if he's not on some government or

3599
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:29,200
private payroll

3600
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:33,119
then just what is he up to and precisely

3601
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:33,120
what does he hope to accomplish by it

3602
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:39,318
about it folks how many of you would

3603
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:39,318
like to hear what makes class tick

3604
02:24:41,139 --> 02:24:44,279
[Applause]

3605
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:50,000
i think he owes us all an explanation of

3606
02:24:48,159 --> 02:24:51,520
what in my opinion and i'm sure in that

3607
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,719
of many others here

3608
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:57,840
has been 20 long years

3609
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:57,840
of unprofessional attitude

3610
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:02,639
as a matter of fact i think he owes a

3611
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:06,120
lot of people an apology

3612
02:25:02,639 --> 02:25:06,119
myself included

3613
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:14,079
pages of my newsletter are open to you

3614
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,520
phil

3615
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:16,719
whenever you're ready to explain

3616
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:20,239
yourself

3617
02:25:16,719 --> 02:25:20,239
you'll be more than happy to print it

3618
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:25,839
now having gotten that out of the way

3619
02:25:24,079 --> 02:25:27,280
it seems to be an appropriate place to

3620
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:30,559
tell you the story of man's first

3621
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:30,560
contact with the martians

3622
02:25:30,639 --> 02:25:35,199
during a worldwide telecast of the

3623
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:38,639
martian ambassador's press conference

3624
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:40,159
the following dialogue transpired

3625
02:25:38,639 --> 02:25:42,478
reporter

3626
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:44,000
tell me mr martian

3627
02:25:42,478 --> 02:25:46,799
what sort of social structure do you

3628
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,799
have on mars

3629
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:50,479
martian

3630
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:52,318
well we're um we're all devout

3631
02:25:50,478 --> 02:25:54,000
communists

3632
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:55,840
there are no cares or worries in our

3633
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,520
society

3634
02:25:55,840 --> 02:26:01,920
and we are all extremely happy

3635
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:02,960
reporter

3636
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:04,398
well

3637
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:08,079
what's the one thing about living on

3638
02:26:04,398 --> 02:26:08,079
mars that makes your people the happiest

3639
02:26:08,398 --> 02:26:11,920
martian

3640
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:14,000
well that's a very easy question you see

3641
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:16,398
unlike the people on earth

3642
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,040
we on mars enjoy the distinct advantage

3643
02:26:16,398 --> 02:26:22,639
of living in a completely

3644
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,640
classless society

3645
02:26:30,239 --> 02:26:35,760
so moving from the humerus back to the

3646
02:26:32,079 --> 02:26:37,439
serious here's question 13.

3647
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:41,600
what do i think of whitley strieber and

3648
02:26:37,439 --> 02:26:41,600
his claims of being a ufo abductee

3649
02:26:42,079 --> 02:26:45,520
answer

3650
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:47,120
at first i was highly skeptical

3651
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:49,040
and admittedly somehow jealous of

3652
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,880
whitley

3653
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,479
as a result i undertook to get to know

3654
02:26:50,879 --> 02:26:54,639
the man in order to assess things for

3655
02:26:52,478 --> 02:26:57,279
myself

3656
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:58,959
in that process he's earned my respect

3657
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:01,439
my admiration

3658
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:03,279
and my friendship

3659
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:05,040
whitley has come very close to the truth

3660
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:08,000
in a number of ways and although still

3661
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:09,760
somewhat baffled by his own experiences

3662
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,799
he's found a very acceptable way of

3663
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:14,398
accommodating them into his life

3664
02:27:12,799 --> 02:27:17,199
if one makes a conscious effort to

3665
02:27:14,398 --> 02:27:18,559
remove whitley's emotional reactions

3666
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:21,280
and then takes a hard look at the

3667
02:27:18,559 --> 02:27:23,680
remaining core of information

3668
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,359
the result is an insightful look into

3669
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:27,439
what gives every appearance of being a

3670
02:27:25,359 --> 02:27:28,880
real situation

3671
02:27:27,439 --> 02:27:30,800
in any event

3672
02:27:28,879 --> 02:27:32,239
i certainly wouldn't dismiss this man

3673
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:33,920
too lightly

3674
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:36,559
we're going to hear a lot more from him

3675
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:39,439
before it's all over

3676
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:41,680
question 14.

3677
02:27:39,439 --> 02:27:43,439
jerome clark reported in fate magazine

3678
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:45,760
that i and jamie chanduray made a trip

3679
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:47,840
to washington dc

3680
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:50,159
in anticipation of meeting a live alien

3681
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:51,760
and were stood up in the process

3682
02:27:50,159 --> 02:27:53,840
doesn't this imply that we were highly

3683
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:55,359
gullible individuals

3684
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:56,719
the experience was probably just a

3685
02:27:55,359 --> 02:27:59,840
practical joke on the part of the

3686
02:27:56,719 --> 02:27:59,840
disinformation crowd

3687
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,520
answered

3688
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:05,680
not at all

3689
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:07,439
if you stop to think about it

3690
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:09,600
considering what you now know of our

3691
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:12,880
project and its goals

3692
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:14,399
we had a story no matter what happened

3693
02:28:12,879 --> 02:28:17,039
we made the trip because we simply

3694
02:28:14,398 --> 02:28:18,559
couldn't lose

3695
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:21,439
but then there's more to that experience

3696
02:28:18,559 --> 02:28:21,439
than you know about

3697
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:26,159
once again let me caution the hasty

3698
02:28:24,239 --> 02:28:29,359
pudding crowd not to jump to conclusions

3699
02:28:26,159 --> 02:28:29,359
until all the facts are in

3700
02:28:29,439 --> 02:28:35,760
question 15

3701
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:35,760
what are my plans for the future

3702
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:40,079
answer

3703
02:28:38,159 --> 02:28:41,760
i and my associates will continue our

3704
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:44,000
work and we'll continue to keep you

3705
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,359
informed of our results as circumstances

3706
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,280
warned

3707
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:50,800
what you've heard today is only part of

3708
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:50,800
a larger body of information

3709
02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:55,200
question 16.

3710
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:57,040
assuming they're interested what can

3711
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:59,840
fellow ufologists do to support our

3712
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:01,439
continuing efforts

3713
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:03,439
answer

3714
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:05,040
first of all what we're doing takes a

3715
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:07,520
lot of time

3716
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:09,439
and a lot of money

3717
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:11,840
we have the time

3718
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:14,000
money's not always available

3719
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:16,239
the easiest thing you can do is to make

3720
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,799
some contribution to the effort

3721
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:20,719
if not in cash which by no means do we

3722
02:29:18,799 --> 02:29:22,719
request

3723
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:24,398
you might want to offer time

3724
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:26,398
research services

3725
02:29:24,398 --> 02:29:27,760
you might have information which you

3726
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:29,439
feel we are interested we might be

3727
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:31,359
interested in

3728
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:34,479
in any case

3729
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:36,960
feel free to contact us at any time

3730
02:29:34,478 --> 02:29:40,079
two years ago in washington dc

3731
02:29:36,959 --> 02:29:42,079
i stated we were looking for help

3732
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:45,680
the response was damn few offers and a

3733
02:29:42,079 --> 02:29:47,920
lot of rocks thrown in our direction

3734
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:49,920
i can say to you now

3735
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,040
that at last inventory we had plenty of

3736
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:53,920
rocks

3737
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:55,520
we still need the help

3738
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:56,960
those of you that still have rocks to

3739
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,560
throw

3740
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:00,478
allow me to suggest that they might be

3741
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:02,398
put to better use by tossing them at the

3742
02:30:00,478 --> 02:30:06,239
rumor mongers

3743
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:08,879
or the disinformers or the incompetents

3744
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:10,159
that are presently running rampant

3745
02:30:08,879 --> 02:30:13,199
those people are the ones that are

3746
02:30:10,159 --> 02:30:15,359
giving us a bad image

3747
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:17,520
question 17

3748
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:19,760
what about the so-called blue book 13

3749
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:21,280
report

3750
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:23,359
answer

3751
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:25,359
i think it's best left up to those who

3752
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:28,399
are circulating this material to provide

3753
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:30,720
the proof of its authenticity

3754
02:30:28,398 --> 02:30:33,519
i remain unconvinced of it but

3755
02:30:30,719 --> 02:30:35,279
open-minded

3756
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:38,319
which brings me at last to the final

3757
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:39,920
section of this lengthy paper

3758
02:30:38,318 --> 02:30:41,680
it seems to me that it's high time i

3759
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:43,600
made my position clear about a few

3760
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:44,960
things

3761
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:46,479
a lot of people seem to be very

3762
02:30:44,959 --> 02:30:47,919
interested in knowing where bill moore

3763
02:30:46,478 --> 02:30:50,159
stands

3764
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:51,680
so here goes

3765
02:30:50,159 --> 02:30:53,680
let me begin by stating that the

3766
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:55,520
positions presented here are entirely my

3767
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:57,600
own

3768
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:59,680
all are based upon evidence obtained by

3769
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:02,399
me and by associates

3770
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:04,000
during the course of our project

3771
02:31:02,398 --> 02:31:05,519
some of that has been made available

3772
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,200
already

3773
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,640
some is provided for the first time in

3774
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:10,479
this paper

3775
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:13,680
and some remains to be released at a

3776
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:15,519
later more appropriate time

3777
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:18,479
as to the existence and depth of that

3778
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,159
which yet is yet to be released

3779
02:31:18,478 --> 02:31:22,559
you'll just have to take my word for the

3780
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:25,359
time being

3781
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:28,000
to best to the best of my knowledge

3782
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:29,200
everything here is true

3783
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,520
indeed

3784
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:33,439
although i confessed to having practiced

3785
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:35,040
an occasional deception now and again

3786
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:37,520
over the years in order to protect the

3787
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:40,160
integrity of what i was doing

3788
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:42,720
our goal from the very beginning

3789
02:31:40,159 --> 02:31:44,799
was to keep things as above board as

3790
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:48,318
possible

3791
02:31:44,799 --> 02:31:52,239
after all ours is a search for answers

3792
02:31:48,318 --> 02:31:52,239
not an effort to create more mysteries

3793
02:31:54,398 --> 02:31:58,879
position number one

3794
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:01,600
is that a highly advanced

3795
02:31:58,879 --> 02:32:04,159
extraterrestrial civilization

3796
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:06,000
is visiting planet earth

3797
02:32:04,159 --> 02:32:10,200
and is actively manipulating our

3798
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,200
awareness of their presence here

3799
02:32:10,478 --> 02:32:14,959
position number two

3800
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:16,799
elements of at least two of the us

3801
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:18,799
government's intelligence agencies are

3802
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:20,879
aware of this

3803
02:32:18,799 --> 02:32:22,398
and both are presently conducting highly

3804
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:25,839
classified

3805
02:32:22,398 --> 02:32:25,840
ongoing research projects

3806
02:32:26,719 --> 02:32:29,920
i can tell you without reservation that

3807
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:31,679
at least one of these efforts and

3808
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:34,318
possibly both

3809
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:36,239
has access to electromagnetic optical

3810
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:38,799
and infrared signature data which if

3811
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:41,520
released to the public would provide

3812
02:32:38,799 --> 02:32:43,039
proof positive that some ufos represent

3813
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:45,680
somebody else's highly advanced

3814
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:45,680
technology

3815
02:32:46,398 --> 02:32:51,199
unfortunately

3816
02:32:48,639 --> 02:32:53,840
i can't tell you more at this time

3817
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,760
i wish i could

3818
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:56,960
those of you who find me competent and

3819
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:59,439
credible

3820
02:32:56,959 --> 02:33:02,159
will take this as a revelation

3821
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:03,760
which is as it should be

3822
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:05,600
those who hold other opinions will

3823
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:07,760
continue to throw rocks while loudly

3824
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:09,760
demanding at the same time that i

3825
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:11,760
deliver proof positive into their hands

3826
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:13,520
on a silver platter so that they can

3827
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:15,120
call it their own and claim credit for

3828
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:18,159
it

3829
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:18,160
patience my friends

3830
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:24,079
position three

3831
02:33:22,159 --> 02:33:25,920
u.s government counter-intelligence

3832
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:27,840
people have conducted an on-again

3833
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:30,799
off-again campaign of deception and

3834
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:34,318
disinformation about the ufo phenomenon

3835
02:33:30,799 --> 02:33:36,239
for more than 40 years

3836
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:38,318
those who have been responsible for such

3837
02:33:36,239 --> 02:33:41,520
operations are highly placed individuals

3838
02:33:38,318 --> 02:33:42,959
within at least two separate agencies

3839
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:46,239
and there does seem to be a degree of

3840
02:33:42,959 --> 02:33:46,239
cooperation between them

3841
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:51,680
these operations involve a large number

3842
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:53,439
of people and are well organized

3843
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:54,880
they also include the use of phony

3844
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:56,639
documents

3845
02:33:54,879 --> 02:33:58,079
and the recruiting of informants who are

3846
02:33:56,639 --> 02:33:59,599
able to provide information on the

3847
02:33:58,079 --> 02:34:02,398
activities of people

3848
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:05,120
conducting ufo research or who have had

3849
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:07,760
ufo experiences

3850
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:09,920
why is this happening

3851
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:12,318
my experience suggests five different

3852
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:12,318
reasons

3853
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:16,799
a

3854
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:19,039
the disinformation

3855
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:21,920
provides security cover

3856
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:23,600
for a real ufo project which exists at a

3857
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:27,280
very high level

3858
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:27,280
and is known only to an elite few

3859
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:31,200
b

3860
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:33,280
it is also useful

3861
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:35,200
as part of a security process designed

3862
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:38,000
to divert attention away from the real

3863
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:41,280
but non-ufo related high-tech research

3864
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,280
and development projects

3865
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:45,040
c

3866
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:47,120
it is a manipulation by a group of

3867
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:49,280
highly placed and well-to-do individuals

3868
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:52,079
like the trilateralists

3869
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:54,159
who espouse a one-world philosophy

3870
02:34:52,079 --> 02:34:56,559
and who are using the ufo phenomena in

3871
02:34:54,159 --> 02:34:58,318
an effort to bring about world unity

3872
02:34:56,559 --> 02:35:00,719
in the face of an unknown threat from

3873
02:34:58,318 --> 02:35:00,719
space

3874
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:04,318
d

3875
02:35:02,159 --> 02:35:05,840
it provides a convenient way to train

3876
02:35:04,318 --> 02:35:07,119
counter intelligence agents in the

3877
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:09,920
techniques of deception and

3878
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:09,920
disinformation

3879
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,600
e

3880
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:15,280
it is a manipulation by ufo aliens

3881
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:17,280
themselves

3882
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:21,200
as part of their plan to gradually make

3883
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:25,640
human society aware of their presence

3884
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:25,640
my position is that the truth is

3885
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:37,439
whether those people are witting or

3886
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:40,439
unwitting tools of this process i do not

3887
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:40,439
know

3888
02:35:48,318 --> 02:35:52,639
the last

3889
02:35:50,639 --> 02:35:54,719
best thing the disinformation people

3890
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:56,398
expected however

3891
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:58,879
is that someone who knew of their

3892
02:35:56,398 --> 02:36:02,159
activities with the benefits affair

3893
02:35:58,879 --> 02:36:05,119
would pop up after so many years

3894
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:05,119
and burst their balloon

3895
02:36:06,239 --> 02:36:10,559
position four

3896
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:13,358
we have been able to confirm that there

3897
02:36:10,559 --> 02:36:15,119
is in fact a group known as mj12 which

3898
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:18,159
operates at the white house national

3899
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:19,920
security council level

3900
02:36:18,159 --> 02:36:21,119
it's the best of my knowledge this group

3901
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:23,840
still uses

3902
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:25,840
12 as the designator

3903
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:28,318
the level 6 level of security around

3904
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:31,120
this group is such that we have not yet

3905
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:33,840
succeeded in establishing whether or not

3906
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:36,160
its functions are ufo related

3907
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:38,559
or even precisely how long the group has

3908
02:36:36,159 --> 02:36:38,559
existed

3909
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:43,358
along these same lines

3910
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:45,680
none of our sources has indicated any

3911
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:49,359
knowledge whatsoever with terms such as

3912
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:51,600
magi majesty pi40 plato

3913
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:53,760
garnet or a number of other terms

3914
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:56,079
currently being spread by certain

3915
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:58,159
elements

3916
02:36:56,079 --> 02:37:02,559
position five

3917
02:36:58,159 --> 02:37:05,039
there is in fact a project aquarius

3918
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:06,478
possibly two of them

3919
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:08,560
they have succeeded in obtaining

3920
02:37:06,478 --> 02:37:12,478
considerable information about one such

3921
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:14,879
project in the 1971 73 time frame

3922
02:37:12,478 --> 02:37:16,559
and sketchy information about another

3923
02:37:14,879 --> 02:37:17,599
which may be a later extension of the

3924
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:21,519
first one

3925
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:23,600
in the 76 to 85 time frame

3926
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:25,359
this information includes contract and

3927
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:26,800
report numbers

3928
02:37:25,359 --> 02:37:30,318
as well as the names of several

3929
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:33,679
individuals who worked on the project

3930
02:37:30,318 --> 02:37:35,279
more details will be forthcoming later

3931
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:37,600
meanwhile

3932
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:39,680
it ill behooves ufo researchers to

3933
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:42,239
deluge the government with free freedom

3934
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:45,040
of information requests for details of

3935
02:37:42,239 --> 02:37:46,879
sensitive high-level projects

3936
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:48,800
this simply alerts the powers that be

3937
02:37:46,879 --> 02:37:51,199
that you are on to them

3938
02:37:48,799 --> 02:37:52,799
and thus makes it all the more difficult

3939
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:54,880
to obtain information through other

3940
02:37:52,799 --> 02:37:56,879
channels

3941
02:37:54,879 --> 02:37:58,239
in the rush for me first in the ufo

3942
02:37:56,879 --> 02:38:01,920
community

3943
02:37:58,239 --> 02:38:03,199
we are often our own worst enemies

3944
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:05,840
discretion

3945
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:08,159
is the better part of valor

3946
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:10,559
position six

3947
02:38:08,159 --> 02:38:12,239
with respect to the controversial mj-12

3948
02:38:10,559 --> 02:38:14,398
papers

3949
02:38:12,239 --> 02:38:17,439
these have now been examined by a number

3950
02:38:14,398 --> 02:38:19,840
of question documents experts

3951
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:21,200
and other research on them is continuing

3952
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:23,920
as well as you've just heard from my

3953
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:23,920
friend stanton

3954
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:28,799
in the case of the cutler twining memo

3955
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:31,120
found in the national archives

3956
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:34,239
i can state with reasonable certainty

3957
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:36,000
that it is an authentic document

3958
02:38:34,239 --> 02:38:38,239
and the best evidence indicates that

3959
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:40,398
someone planted it amidst the papers of

3960
02:38:38,239 --> 02:38:42,000
record group 341

3961
02:38:40,398 --> 02:38:44,879
knowing that there was a strong chance

3962
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,879
we would find it there

3963
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:49,200
with respect to the so-called eisenhower

3964
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:51,040
briefing document

3965
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:53,760
there is still no compelling reason to

3966
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:55,840
believe it is anything but authentic

3967
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:58,239
on the other hand its authenticity

3968
02:38:55,840 --> 02:39:00,000
remains far from proved

3969
02:38:58,239 --> 02:39:01,600
so in the final analysis the scale

3970
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,398
remains balanced by the weight of

3971
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:06,559
arguments on both sides

3972
02:39:04,398 --> 02:39:08,159
if it's the real thing

3973
02:39:06,559 --> 02:39:09,680
it's going to take extraordinary

3974
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:12,318
evidence to convince even some of the

3975
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:14,239
more liberal skeptics

3976
02:39:12,318 --> 02:39:16,799
if it's a hoax

3977
02:39:14,239 --> 02:39:18,000
it's extraordinarily well done

3978
02:39:16,799 --> 02:39:19,759
much better

3979
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,120
than the sort of disinformation i

3980
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:23,359
encountered in connection with the

3981
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:24,399
benowitz case

3982
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:27,600
of course

3983
02:39:24,398 --> 02:39:31,199
it still may be disinformation

3984
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:31,200
but again then again it may not

3985
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:36,079
either way

3986
02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:39,359
there's a major story here

3987
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:40,799
and the controversy is far from over

3988
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:43,520
if it's real

3989
02:39:40,799 --> 02:39:46,478
it speaks for itself

3990
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:50,159
if it's disinformation the equally

3991
02:39:46,478 --> 02:39:52,639
important story of why

3992
02:39:50,159 --> 02:39:54,719
needs to be told

3993
02:39:52,639 --> 02:39:57,639
as for the so-called truman executive

3994
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:59,358
order of september 24

3995
02:39:57,639 --> 02:40:01,119
1947

3996
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:02,800
which is actually the final page of the

3997
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:04,479
portion of the eisenhower document which

3998
02:40:02,799 --> 02:40:06,079
we have

3999
02:40:04,478 --> 02:40:08,159
the analysts have come up with mixed

4000
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:10,559
results

4001
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:14,398
though not yet disproved this document

4002
02:40:10,559 --> 02:40:14,398
presents the weakest case of the three

4003
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:19,279
we are working

4004
02:40:16,959 --> 02:40:21,199
on a final report on this matter which

4005
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:23,520
will include the results of typeface

4006
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:26,640
analysis and other processes it's going

4007
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:26,640
to be a lengthy affair

4008
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:30,239
before leaving it however i would like

4009
02:40:28,478 --> 02:40:32,000
to at least comment on what has emerged

4010
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:34,879
as the most controversial aspect of the

4011
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:37,680
mj-12 document affair

4012
02:40:34,879 --> 02:40:39,039
that is a date format

4013
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:41,600
there are a couple of points i would

4014
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:42,960
like to make

4015
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:45,520
one

4016
02:40:42,959 --> 02:40:47,839
if the similarities between stylistic

4017
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:50,560
characteristics of the documents

4018
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:53,279
and my own writings are important as

4019
02:40:50,559 --> 02:40:55,000
some have claimed

4020
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:58,960
then are not

4021
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:01,760
dissimilarities equally important

4022
02:40:58,959 --> 02:41:05,358
there are some you know

4023
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:05,359
even in the way the dates are written

4024
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,640
why do those who go to such pains to

4025
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:13,920
point out similarities

4026
02:41:10,639 --> 02:41:17,039
not go to equal pains to point out disc

4027
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:19,920
similarities especially when they claim

4028
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:22,960
to be using the scientific method

4029
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:24,960
who did i wonder be prejudiced

4030
02:41:22,959 --> 02:41:27,679
or does the word incompetence better

4031
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:27,679
describe it

4032
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:33,920
two we are by no means convinced that

4033
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:37,120
the date format is as critical an issue

4034
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:41,279
as others would make it out to be

4035
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:43,680
while the style is admittedly unusual

4036
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:45,439
it is not without precedent

4037
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:47,760
and that of course is the bottom line

4038
02:41:45,439 --> 02:41:47,760
isn't it

4039
02:41:48,079 --> 02:41:51,439
three

4040
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:53,680
to those of you who still harbor

4041
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:56,079
suspicions that i created the documents

4042
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:59,840
and i'm perpetrating a hoax

4043
02:41:56,079 --> 02:41:59,840
i say thank you for the compliment

4044
02:42:00,159 --> 02:42:03,520
to those of you who think it more likely

4045
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:05,600
that i am the innocent victim of an

4046
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:07,279
elaborate hoax

4047
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:08,960
i conceived that this remains a

4048
02:42:07,279 --> 02:42:12,159
possibility which has not yet been

4049
02:42:08,959 --> 02:42:14,879
entirely ruled out

4050
02:42:12,159 --> 02:42:18,559
position seven

4051
02:42:14,879 --> 02:42:21,519
the matter of alien abductions of humans

4052
02:42:18,559 --> 02:42:23,600
is apparently regarded as serious

4053
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:25,359
by those within the government

4054
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:28,239
who are aware of the extraterrestrial

4055
02:42:25,359 --> 02:42:30,000
nature of ufos

4056
02:42:28,239 --> 02:42:32,279
this is evidenced by the fact that the

4057
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:33,840
government has gone so far as to

4058
02:42:32,279 --> 02:42:36,720
disinform

4059
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:40,279
its own counter-intelligence people on

4060
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:40,278
that very subject

4061
02:42:44,559 --> 02:42:49,039
i don't know

4062
02:42:46,559 --> 02:42:51,600
position eight

4063
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:54,399
the secret behind the government ufo

4064
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:57,600
cover-up is essentially an awareness of

4065
02:42:54,398 --> 02:42:58,799
what ufos are by a few people in high

4066
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:00,640
places

4067
02:42:58,799 --> 02:43:04,318
who have connections with the national

4068
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:04,318
security council in the white house

4069
02:43:04,478 --> 02:43:09,119
widespread publicity about the abduction

4070
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:13,199
phenomenon is

4071
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:13,200
in what is already a difficult situation

4072
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:17,120
within group there are strong

4073
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:18,720
differences of opinion

4074
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:21,840
as to whether information should be

4075
02:43:18,719 --> 02:43:23,679
released to the public and how

4076
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,600
there seems to be some consternation

4077
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:28,239
about exactly who is in control of the

4078
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:28,239
situation

4079
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:34,640
position nine

4080
02:43:32,159 --> 02:43:37,600
ufology has been stumbling around for 30

4081
02:43:34,639 --> 02:43:39,760
years looking for answers

4082
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:42,399
unless something is done

4083
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:44,318
to reduce the petty bickering

4084
02:43:42,398 --> 02:43:46,159
the rumor mongering

4085
02:43:44,318 --> 02:43:48,159
the name calling

4086
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:50,639
the ego massaging

4087
02:43:48,159 --> 02:43:52,639
the power politics and the personal

4088
02:43:50,639 --> 02:43:53,599
vendettas which have been taking up our

4089
02:43:52,639 --> 02:43:55,840
time

4090
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:57,680
sapping our strength and disgracing our

4091
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:59,840
image lately

4092
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:01,680
i expect mainstream ufology will go

4093
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:03,600
right on stumbling for a long time to

4094
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:05,200
come

4095
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:06,800
what is needed

4096
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:09,359
i submit

4097
02:44:06,799 --> 02:44:11,199
is a society of professional ufologists

4098
02:44:09,359 --> 02:44:14,000
which adheres to established research

4099
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:16,479
procedures and techniques

4100
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:18,478
which maintains a rigorous set of ethics

4101
02:44:16,478 --> 02:44:21,358
and standards

4102
02:44:18,478 --> 02:44:23,199
and which limits its membership to a few

4103
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:25,040
whose competence has been appropriately

4104
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:27,760
demonstrated

4105
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:29,920
no matter what happens however

4106
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:32,719
i am committed to completing the process

4107
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:34,960
i have begun

4108
02:44:32,719 --> 02:44:37,920
i am presently working with a network of

4109
02:44:34,959 --> 02:44:40,000
more than a dozen individuals

4110
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:41,920
some of whom hold some very impressive

4111
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:44,159
credentials

4112
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:47,600
we have been actively exploring the

4113
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:50,398
labyrinth of government ufo involvement

4114
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:53,359
and we will continue to do so

4115
02:44:50,398 --> 02:44:56,879
until we feel the task is complete

4116
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:56,880
or that we can go no further

4117
02:44:56,959 --> 02:45:01,358
our group

4118
02:44:58,478 --> 02:45:03,039
is euphemistically called the aviary

4119
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:04,880
and each individual

4120
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:07,359
uses a code name of a bird as an

4121
02:45:04,879 --> 02:45:09,278
identifier

4122
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:12,800
we will continue

4123
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:15,359
to provide the ufo community with data

4124
02:45:12,799 --> 02:45:17,599
and we will continue to proceed

4125
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:19,520
in a way which we feel best suits our

4126
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:21,359
purposes

4127
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:24,000
a number of people have suggested to me

4128
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:26,000
recently that i should defend myself

4129
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:29,359
against various allegations and rumors

4130
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:30,959
which have been circulating lately

4131
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:33,279
well folks you've just heard the case

4132
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:35,119
for the defense

4133
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:38,159
now reach down inside of yourselves and

4134
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:40,319
wrench forth of judgment

4135
02:45:38,159 --> 02:45:42,639
i and my group of associates are going

4136
02:45:40,318 --> 02:45:43,920
to find some answers no matter what it

4137
02:45:42,639 --> 02:45:47,358
takes

4138
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:49,200
and no matter how long it takes

4139
02:45:47,359 --> 02:45:50,399
we are out there

4140
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:53,040
digging

4141
02:45:50,398 --> 02:45:54,799
and we are going to continue to dig

4142
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:58,720
either with the support of the ufo

4143
02:45:54,799 --> 02:46:01,358
community or without it

4144
02:45:58,719 --> 02:46:04,478
armchair researchers and hasty pudding

4145
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:06,239
pot shop plagiarist ufologists

4146
02:46:04,478 --> 02:46:08,079
whose only goal is to make themselves

4147
02:46:06,239 --> 02:46:10,159
look important at others expense take

4148
02:46:08,079 --> 02:46:11,600
note

4149
02:46:10,159 --> 02:46:13,200
those of you who think we're doing a

4150
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:14,640
good job and want to be part of that

4151
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:16,560
process

4152
02:46:14,639 --> 02:46:19,680
please know that we welcome any support

4153
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:21,359
you feel you can offer even if we've had

4154
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:23,520
personal differences between us in the

4155
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:26,399
past

4156
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:29,200
those who feel it's all a con game

4157
02:46:26,398 --> 02:46:31,199
or that it's all disinformation

4158
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:32,560
can continue to throw all the rocks you

4159
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:35,520
want

4160
02:46:32,559 --> 02:46:39,478
we're going to go right on without you

4161
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:39,479
just as we always have

4162
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:41,600
in closing

4163
02:46:40,329 --> 02:46:43,200
[Music]

4164
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:47,439
i wish to state that the text you've

and finally

4172
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:01,439
this paper marks a radical change of

4173
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:03,279
position for me

4174
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:05,279
in the past i've always been very

4175
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:07,439
careful to qualify my statements about

4176
02:47:05,279 --> 02:47:10,239
the possible extra extraterrestrial

4177
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:13,040
nature of ufos so as to leave room for

4178
02:47:10,239 --> 02:47:15,039
other explanations

4179
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:17,040
all the evidence that my associates and

4180
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:20,000
i have accumulated to date however boils

4181
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:21,359
down to two inescapable conclusions

4182
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,200
first

4183
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:25,040
there is an extraterrestrial presence

4184
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:26,319
here on planet earth

4185
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:28,399
and second

4186
02:47:26,318 --> 02:47:29,760
a small number of individuals within our

4187
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:31,760
government know it

4188
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:33,359
but remain undecided as to what to do

4189
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:35,359
about it

4190
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:36,880
these two things represent the bottom

4191
02:47:35,359 --> 02:47:38,318
line

4192
02:47:36,879 --> 02:47:40,719
from there

4193
02:47:38,318 --> 02:47:42,799
it's only a question when covering

4194
02:47:40,719 --> 02:47:44,639
just how much of the rest

4195
02:47:42,799 --> 02:47:46,398
of the ufo story

4196
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:49,039
is for real

4197
02:47:46,398 --> 02:47:52,559
and how much of it is

4198
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:55,600
that is precisely what we intend to do

4199
02:47:52,559 --> 02:47:58,079
so either climb aboard and hang on

4200
02:47:55,600 --> 02:48:02,000
or get off the tracks

4201
02:47:58,079 --> 02:48:03,760
i apologize for having taken so long

4202
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:05,439
if i've offended

4203
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:08,239
that's unfortunate

4204
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:10,239
but i have tried to be truthful with you

4205
02:48:08,239 --> 02:48:12,719
i had a lot to say

4206
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:13,680
and it needed to be said

4207
02:48:12,719 --> 02:48:16,409
thank you

4208
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:21,020
good night and farewell

4209
02:48:16,409 --> 02:48:21,020
[Music]

4210
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:30,559
a little rough from time to time so if i

4211
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:34,799
offend i do apologize

4212
02:48:30,559 --> 02:48:34,799
but unfortunately that's the way i am

4213
02:48:37,279 --> 02:48:41,359
first of all before i begin i would like

4214
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:42,960
to thank

4215
02:48:41,359 --> 02:48:45,279
very much

4216
02:48:42,959 --> 02:48:48,879
mr john lear for making it possible for

4217
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:48,880
me to be here at this conference

4218
02:48:48,959 --> 02:48:52,478
i did not know whether or not i would be

4219
02:48:50,559 --> 02:48:55,439
able to make it and john made that

4220
02:48:52,478 --> 02:48:56,879
possible and he has my deepest gratitude

4221
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:59,279
because i've been looking forward for an

4222
02:48:56,879 --> 02:49:01,839
opportunity like this for almost 10

4223
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:01,840
years now

4224
02:49:02,559 --> 02:49:06,318
and also i'd like to thank the other

4225
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:10,920
speakers who very graciously donated

4226
02:49:06,318 --> 02:49:10,920
some of their time to allow me to speak

4227
02:49:12,079 --> 02:49:18,159
i have 45 minutes and in 45 minutes i

4228
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:20,000
have to condense 12 years

4229
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:21,840
of information

4230
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:24,879
and happenings

4231
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:24,880
what i would like to do

4232
02:49:25,279 --> 02:49:31,439
is speak for 30 minutes and then for 15

4233
02:49:28,239 --> 02:49:33,199
minutes except questions from the floor

4234
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:35,760
and i'd like to make a promise to you at

4235
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:35,760
this point

4236
02:49:36,478 --> 02:49:40,840
that unlike certain people

4237
02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:44,639
i will not try to treat you like

4238
02:49:42,719 --> 02:49:47,599
mushrooms by keeping you in the dark and

4239
02:49:44,639 --> 02:49:47,599
feeding you

4240
02:49:48,559 --> 02:49:52,879
and that

4241
02:49:50,959 --> 02:49:56,478
and that during the question and answer

4242
02:49:52,879 --> 02:49:59,519
period i will not ask myself questions

4243
02:49:56,478 --> 02:49:59,519
and answer them for you

4244
02:50:02,318 --> 02:50:06,799
give you a little background about

4245
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:09,520
myself in 1976 while working for the

4246
02:50:06,799 --> 02:50:12,318
united states government

4247
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:15,760
at raf chick sands u.s air force base

4248
02:50:12,318 --> 02:50:20,000
security services command

4249
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:21,840
in bedford england as a data analyst

4250
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:24,159
i had the occasion to view a document

4251
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:26,239
entitled grudge blue book report number

4252
02:50:24,159 --> 02:50:27,600
13.

4253
02:50:26,239 --> 02:50:29,520
those of you who are aware of the

4254
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:31,600
history of blue book

4255
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:33,600
know the grudge blue book or blue book

4256
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:35,120
report number 13

4257
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:37,439
is a document

4258
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:40,000
that the government has sworn for years

4259
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:41,359
does not exist

4260
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:43,279
well i'm here to tell you ladies and

4261
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:46,000
gentlemen that's crap

4262
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:47,439
it does exist

4263
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,840
well employed by the government

4264
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:52,479
fulfilling my

4265
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:55,920
duties i analyze that document

4266
02:50:52,478 --> 02:50:55,920
i read it very carefully

4267
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:02,239
over 600 pages

4268
02:50:58,398 --> 02:51:02,239
over half of that was photographs

4269
02:51:02,639 --> 02:51:06,159
the content of that document consisted

4270
02:51:04,719 --> 02:51:09,119
largely

4271
02:51:06,159 --> 02:51:11,680
of technical reports

4272
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:13,680
autopsy reports

4273
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:16,318
and photographs

4274
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:19,720
of alien beings

4275
02:51:16,318 --> 02:51:19,719
alien technology

4276
02:51:20,079 --> 02:51:24,398
and on sundry other things

4277
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:26,159
which i will get into

4278
02:51:24,398 --> 02:51:28,959
and at this point i would like to make

4279
02:51:26,159 --> 02:51:31,600
mention that i find myself in a very

4280
02:51:28,959 --> 02:51:33,919
very poor position

4281
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:35,600
which i am not entirely happy with

4282
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:39,279
because i'm being forced to do something

4283
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:39,279
i swore up and down i would never do

4284
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:44,639
and that is respond to last night's

4285
02:51:42,398 --> 02:51:46,318
speaker mr bill moore

4286
02:51:44,639 --> 02:51:51,119
and i will do that after i give you a

4287
02:51:46,318 --> 02:51:51,119
brief rundown of the blue book 13 report

4288
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:57,520
the version of the document that i saw

4289
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:59,279
was an annotated version

4290
02:51:57,520 --> 02:52:02,159
mr cooper saw his version of the

4291
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:04,960
document in the early 70s

4292
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:07,200
i saw my version of the same document

4293
02:52:04,959 --> 02:52:08,959
in the mid 70s

4294
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:12,600
my version of the document had been

4295
02:52:08,959 --> 02:52:12,599
expanded considerably

4296
02:52:14,478 --> 02:52:20,079
a large portion of the document

4297
02:52:16,159 --> 02:52:20,079
consisted largely of photographs

4298
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:25,359
photographs which

4299
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:29,559
showed alien beings

4300
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:29,559
alive and dead

4301
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:33,200
micro photography photographs of tissue

4302
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:36,880
samples

4303
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:39,760
lab reports of fluid samples

4304
02:52:36,879 --> 02:52:41,519
analytical data from the findings of

4305
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:44,639
tests

4306
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:46,880
technical data concerning craft

4307
02:52:44,639 --> 02:52:49,599
power units

4308
02:52:46,879 --> 02:52:52,239
and possibly weapons

4309
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:54,840
the general tone of the document itself

4310
02:52:52,239 --> 02:52:57,600
was geared basically toward

4311
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:59,600
defense how would we defend against

4312
02:52:57,600 --> 02:53:01,040
something like this

4313
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:02,960
how would we defend against the

4314
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:04,399
technology

4315
02:53:02,959 --> 02:53:06,318
that was obvious

4316
02:53:04,398 --> 02:53:08,879
and that was shown and reported upon in

4317
02:53:06,318 --> 02:53:08,879
the document

4318
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,840
now

4319
02:53:12,318 --> 02:53:18,398
for the past 12 years

4320
02:53:14,719 --> 02:53:18,398
eight of which i was in hiding

4321
02:53:20,559 --> 02:53:26,478
i have been called a liar

4322
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:27,840
i have been called a drug addict

4323
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:30,559
a pervert

4324
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:32,318
a psychotic you name it and i've been

4325
02:53:30,559 --> 02:53:34,159
called it

4326
02:53:32,318 --> 02:53:35,760
according to some i am probably the most

4327
02:53:34,159 --> 02:53:39,478
perverted son of the you will meet

4328
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:39,478
in the entire world

4329
02:53:39,760 --> 02:53:44,079
and that's fine

4330
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:46,000
after 12 years i've become a little bit

4331
02:53:44,079 --> 02:53:49,279
hard shelled about the whole thing

4332
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,279
and i don't particularly care

4333
02:53:50,079 --> 02:53:52,398
but there's something we have to

4334
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:55,120
understand

4335
02:53:52,398 --> 02:53:57,199
as a group of investigators as a group

4336
02:53:55,120 --> 02:54:01,439
of interested people

4337
02:53:57,200 --> 02:54:04,159
we have to cut through the crap

4338
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:06,398
we have to pull together

4339
02:54:04,159 --> 02:54:08,000
as a unified force and forget

4340
02:54:06,398 --> 02:54:11,199
personalities

4341
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:14,559
forget character assassination

4342
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:17,040
forget all of the politics that exist

4343
02:54:14,559 --> 02:54:18,478
within organizations

4344
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:22,000
and unite

4345
02:54:18,478 --> 02:54:24,398
in order to find the answers that we

4346
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:27,040
need to find

4347
02:54:24,398 --> 02:54:29,680
we have to do this

4348
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:31,359
it's imperative

4349
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:35,120
part of our problem right now is we

4350
02:54:31,359 --> 02:54:39,439
don't even know what the questions are

4351
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:39,439
we have to cooperate with one another

4352
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:46,960
many of you have read john lear's

4353
02:54:44,639 --> 02:54:49,278
interview with me in virginia of last

4354
02:54:46,959 --> 02:54:51,119
year

4355
02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:54,880
in which he outlined much of what i've

4356
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:56,560
been saying for the past 12 years

4357
02:54:54,879 --> 02:55:00,159
i would suggest that you get a copy of

4358
02:54:56,559 --> 02:55:00,159
this if you do not have it and read it

4359
02:55:00,398 --> 02:55:04,000
simple fact of the matter is is i can't

4360
02:55:02,398 --> 02:55:06,639
tell you any more that has already been

4361
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:08,959
published in things like ufo crash at

4362
02:55:06,639 --> 02:55:11,519
aztec by bill steinman and wendell

4363
02:55:08,959 --> 02:55:11,519
stevens

4364
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:15,520
or what has been published by john lear

4365
02:55:14,079 --> 02:55:17,439
it's all there

4366
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:19,040
and most of you i'm sure have touched

4367
02:55:17,439 --> 02:55:22,079
upon the report or read the report on

4368
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:22,080
what was in the report

4369
02:55:24,478 --> 02:55:27,358
unfortunately

4370
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:33,120
i'm faced with a dilemma at this point

4371
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:33,120
and that dilemma is this

4372
02:55:34,079 --> 02:55:38,478
i came here last night to listen to mr

4373
02:55:36,159 --> 02:55:38,478
moore

4374
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:48,159
and i came here with the idea of being

4375
02:55:44,559 --> 02:55:50,079
open-minded as i possibly could

4376
02:55:48,159 --> 02:55:52,318
understanding that people are entitled

4377
02:55:50,079 --> 02:55:54,959
to their own opinion

4378
02:55:52,318 --> 02:55:58,519
their own feeling

4379
02:55:54,959 --> 02:55:58,519
for whatever reason

4380
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:03,920
but there's a part of me that objects

4381
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:03,920
very strongly

4382
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:08,080
to being lied to

4383
02:56:09,279 --> 02:56:12,399
and that's exactly what happened last

4384
02:56:10,879 --> 02:56:15,278
night

4385
02:56:12,398 --> 02:56:15,278
you were lied to

4386
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:21,680
we sat up here in the audience and

4387
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:25,800
listened to a man expound on stuff

4388
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:25,800
that was absolute utter hogwash

4389
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,760
some of you are sitting out there saying

4390
02:56:27,439 --> 02:56:31,680
how can this be true

4391
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:34,318
why is it hogwash he's a respected

4392
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:35,920
investigator

4393
02:56:34,318 --> 02:56:37,680
he's been in the business for a long

4394
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:39,760
time he's published a book he's

4395
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:42,479
published a couple of books

4396
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:42,478
yes he has

4397
02:56:44,079 --> 02:56:48,879
his roswell incident set new precedence

4398
02:56:46,239 --> 02:56:51,199
for investigation in the ufo field and

4399
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:52,398
needs to be commended for it i admire

4400
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:54,720
him for it

4401
02:56:52,398 --> 02:56:58,478
it's an excellent book he broke new

4402
02:56:54,719 --> 02:56:58,478
ground for ufo investigators

4403
02:57:00,959 --> 02:57:07,199
what happened after that i don't know

4404
02:57:04,639 --> 02:57:11,439
you heard mr moore stand up here and say

4405
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:11,439
in 1980 or 1981

4406
02:57:12,318 --> 02:57:18,079
he was approached and given information

4407
02:57:16,239 --> 02:57:19,520
by

4408
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:23,239
falcon or condor or whatever the

4409
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:23,239
buzzard's name was

4410
02:57:24,639 --> 02:57:27,439
that was a lie

4411
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:37,359
it was an absolute lie

4412
02:57:34,239 --> 02:57:39,920
and i know it was alive because in 1979

4413
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:42,159
one month after mr moore arrived in the

4414
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:44,719
state of arizona

4415
02:57:42,159 --> 02:57:46,478
thanks to mr allen benz

4416
02:57:44,719 --> 02:57:50,239
formerly of apro

4417
02:57:46,478 --> 02:57:53,199
now for the foundation of ufo research

4418
02:57:50,239 --> 02:57:53,199
mr moore and i met

4419
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:58,639
at which point i related my information

4420
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,639
to mr moore

4421
02:58:00,879 --> 02:58:05,000
we met not once but twice

4422
02:58:05,359 --> 02:58:11,359
seven months later mr moore came to me

4423
02:58:08,398 --> 02:58:11,358
my place of business

4424
02:58:12,079 --> 02:58:18,159
a little place called trail dust town

4425
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:19,760
off tanker verde road in tucson arizona

4426
02:58:18,159 --> 02:58:21,840
we went across the street to a little

4427
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:23,600
place called the parfait palace

4428
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:25,680
i had a bowl of chili he had a cup of

4429
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:27,200
coffee

4430
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:31,000
i had heartburn

4431
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:31,000
and he had brain burn

4432
02:58:32,079 --> 02:58:37,760
mr moore sat there for two hours and we

4433
02:58:34,398 --> 02:58:38,959
conversed we discussed

4434
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:40,880
what i had

4435
02:58:38,959 --> 02:58:42,478
related to him to begin with in the blue

4436
02:58:40,879 --> 02:58:44,478
book documents

4437
02:58:42,478 --> 02:58:45,840
and i think ostensibly what he was

4438
02:58:44,478 --> 02:58:47,438
trying to do was to see if he could

4439
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:49,040
catch me at a lie

4440
02:58:47,439 --> 02:58:50,559
see if i would tell him the same thing i

4441
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:52,800
told him before

4442
02:58:50,559 --> 02:58:55,359
which is fine any good investigator

4443
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:58,079
would do that

4444
02:58:55,359 --> 02:59:01,359
but somewhere along the line mr moore

4445
02:58:58,079 --> 02:59:03,359
twisted it around

4446
02:59:01,359 --> 02:59:05,760
at that time i had been discussing with

4447
02:59:03,359 --> 02:59:08,318
mr jerry schultz

4448
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:09,760
who had been passing through apro

4449
02:59:08,318 --> 02:59:12,478
and apparently had been passing through

4450
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:16,719
april for several years at that point

4451
02:59:12,478 --> 02:59:16,719
with his bicycle and his little pup tent

4452
02:59:16,879 --> 02:59:21,039
some of the implications of what had

4453
02:59:18,398 --> 02:59:22,799
been going on

4454
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:24,880
quite literally whenever i was in the

4455
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:28,759
afro office mr schultz was in the opera

4456
02:59:24,879 --> 02:59:28,759
office and he grilled me extensively

4457
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:35,680
mr moore asked my opinion of mr schultz

4458
02:59:38,159 --> 02:59:44,239
at that time being fairly conservative

4459
02:59:40,318 --> 02:59:44,239
and not as liberal as i am these days

4460
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:51,439
i expressed the opinion that i thought

4461
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:52,960
mr schultz was a bit different

4462
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:55,439
mr moore brought up the question of

4463
02:59:52,959 --> 02:59:57,599
drugs

4464
02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:59,200
to which i responded i don't know it's

4465
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:01,120
possible

4466
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:03,680
anything's possible

4467
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:05,680
i did not know the man well

4468
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:07,840
i never did know the man well contrary

4469
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:10,398
to what you might have heard

4470
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:11,359
from mr schultz himself we were never

4471
03:00:10,398 --> 03:00:14,318
close

4472
03:00:11,359 --> 03:00:14,318
never had been close

4473
03:00:16,799 --> 03:00:20,639
very shortly after that due to

4474
03:00:18,879 --> 03:00:22,318
circumstances which

4475
03:00:20,639 --> 03:00:26,719
got a little bit out of control with

4476
03:00:22,318 --> 03:00:28,478
regard to my activity and investigation

4477
03:00:26,719 --> 03:00:32,719
and the fact that very suddenly there

4478
03:00:28,478 --> 03:00:32,719
were serious attempts against my life

4479
03:00:34,159 --> 03:00:38,239
it became appropriate for me to

4480
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:40,239
disappear

4481
03:00:38,239 --> 03:00:42,719
at which point i went into hiding for

4482
03:00:40,239 --> 03:00:42,719
eight years

4483
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:48,159
yesterday marked the first anniversary

4484
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:51,799
of me resurfacing into the ufo

4485
03:00:48,159 --> 03:00:51,799
investigative community

4486
03:00:56,318 --> 03:01:01,840
today

4487
03:00:58,639 --> 03:01:03,519
marks the 13th anniversary of my viewing

4488
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:06,159
of the grudge blue book report number

4489
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:09,439
13.

4490
03:01:06,159 --> 03:01:11,600
13 years ago today in 1976

4491
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:15,600
i viewed that document

4492
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:15,600
and my life went to hell in a handcart

4493
03:01:16,079 --> 03:01:20,439
as a result of viewing that document

4494
03:01:20,639 --> 03:01:24,000
as i digress a little bit

4495
03:01:24,239 --> 03:01:27,760
i lost a wife and two kids

4496
03:01:28,398 --> 03:01:32,398
i reported to work as i normally do

4497
03:01:32,719 --> 03:01:37,358
at security services command

4498
03:01:34,799 --> 03:01:38,959
at aria of chick sands

4499
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:40,880
was immediately told to report to the

4500
03:01:38,959 --> 03:01:42,959
base commander's office

4501
03:01:40,879 --> 03:01:45,599
on base

4502
03:01:42,959 --> 03:01:45,599
which i did

4503
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:52,239
where i met colonel robert black thin

4504
03:01:48,398 --> 03:01:52,239
base commander at raf chick sands

4505
03:01:54,559 --> 03:01:58,000
colonel black called me into his office

4506
03:01:56,879 --> 03:02:00,079
and informed me that i was being

4507
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,680
discharged from my job

4508
03:02:00,079 --> 03:02:03,200
and that i was being deported from the

4509
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:06,559
country

4510
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:06,560
as undesirable element

4511
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:13,920
no explanation

4512
03:02:11,279 --> 03:02:13,920
no reason

4513
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:18,478
that was

4514
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:20,159
it it took me several months after my

4515
03:02:18,478 --> 03:02:22,879
return to the united states to finally

4516
03:02:20,159 --> 03:02:24,639
determine what had happened

4517
03:02:22,879 --> 03:02:26,559
i was not allowed to say goodbye to my

4518
03:02:24,639 --> 03:02:28,398
wife or children who remained in england

4519
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:30,959
who remained at ra of chick's ants for

4520
03:02:28,398 --> 03:02:32,159
another five years where she taught

4521
03:02:30,959 --> 03:02:36,000
school

4522
03:02:32,159 --> 03:02:36,000
at the raf check sands dependent school

4523
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:42,159
i have not seen my wife and sons in 12

4524
03:02:39,840 --> 03:02:42,159
years

4525
03:02:42,318 --> 03:02:46,159
i have not heard from them in two years

4526
03:02:46,239 --> 03:02:49,520
i have discovered ultimately that she

4527
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:51,920
was transferred to another air force

4528
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:54,239
base in england where she teaches school

4529
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:54,239
still

4530
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:59,040
i was not allowed to communicate with

4531
03:02:56,959 --> 03:03:00,719
her in any way shape or form i was not

4532
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:03,120
allowed to tell her what was going on

4533
03:03:00,719 --> 03:03:04,879
why it was going on

4534
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:07,120
i did discover later that she had been

4535
03:03:04,879 --> 03:03:09,839
told that i just walked in and quit and

4536
03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:09,840
left the country

4537
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:13,478
and left her

4538
03:03:14,079 --> 03:03:16,879
it's not true

4539
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:22,600
excuse me

4540
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:32,398
it's not true

4541
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:34,399
but that's what she was told

4542
03:03:32,398 --> 03:03:36,559
and any woman in her right mind who's

4543
03:03:34,398 --> 03:03:38,398
left high and dry with two kids to take

4544
03:03:36,559 --> 03:03:41,359
care of

4545
03:03:38,398 --> 03:03:44,559
is going to think the worst

4546
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:44,559
and that's understandable

4547
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:52,479
ultimately after about 10 years i

4548
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:52,479
divorced my wife

4549
03:03:52,559 --> 03:03:56,478
feeling that there was no way i could

4550
03:03:54,239 --> 03:04:00,478
possibly salvage a marriage

4551
03:03:56,478 --> 03:04:00,478
and then after such a long separation

4552
03:04:00,719 --> 03:04:05,840
she had changed and i had changed

4553
03:04:04,159 --> 03:04:09,079
and i decided it was time to get on with

4554
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:09,079
my life

4555
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:12,880
ultimately two years ago i married a

4556
03:04:11,359 --> 03:04:16,079
very wonderful lady

4557
03:04:12,879 --> 03:04:16,079
with two kids of her own

4558
03:04:17,359 --> 03:04:20,239
i'm quite happy

4559
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:26,079
and it looks like this marriage will

4560
03:04:23,439 --> 03:04:27,439
last a long time i hope it will

4561
03:04:26,079 --> 03:04:30,799
because she's about the only person i

4562
03:04:27,439 --> 03:04:32,479
know that can put up with my shenanigans

4563
03:04:30,799 --> 03:04:34,318
she deserves a lot of credit and i'd

4564
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:36,079
like you to know

4565
03:04:34,318 --> 03:04:37,439
that she supports me and i wouldn't be

4566
03:04:36,079 --> 03:04:40,079
able to do what i'm doing today without

4567
03:04:37,439 --> 03:04:40,079
her support

4568
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:51,359
during the last 12

4569
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:53,439
years there have been over 15 attempts

4570
03:04:51,359 --> 03:04:55,600
on my life

4571
03:04:53,439 --> 03:04:57,279
i have been shot at

4572
03:04:55,600 --> 03:05:00,239
i've been stabbed

4573
03:04:57,279 --> 03:05:00,239
i've been blown up

4574
03:05:01,680 --> 03:05:05,840
i've contracted food poisoning

4575
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:11,120
all the little things that are geared to

4576
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:11,120
look like nice little accidents

4577
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:17,120
now some of you will say well if you

4578
03:05:15,359 --> 03:05:21,120
were in such a secure position while you

4579
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:21,120
were hiding why did you come back out

4580
03:05:22,879 --> 03:05:29,559
i was employed at a radio station in

4581
03:05:24,639 --> 03:05:29,559
lynchburg virginia wlva stereo59

4582
03:05:30,318 --> 03:05:33,840
by this time john lear

4583
03:05:34,318 --> 03:05:38,000
had tried to contact my father

4584
03:05:38,318 --> 03:05:42,239
my father is william j english

4585
03:05:40,719 --> 03:05:45,799
speaker of the house of representatives

4586
03:05:42,239 --> 03:05:45,799
for the state of arizona

4587
03:05:47,279 --> 03:05:53,120
my father being somewhat aware of my

4588
03:05:49,279 --> 03:05:56,000
desire to maintain my anonymity

4589
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:59,760
denied my existence to john

4590
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:03,520
had his secretary deny my existence

4591
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:03,520
and john bless's heart persisted

4592
03:06:04,959 --> 03:06:08,959
persisted to the point where my father

4593
03:06:06,799 --> 03:06:11,119
secretary

4594
03:06:08,959 --> 03:06:14,559
was so worked up and so upset my father

4595
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:16,319
decided to forward john's phone number

4596
03:06:14,559 --> 03:06:18,318
and a terse little note saying that he

4597
03:06:16,318 --> 03:06:20,239
did not tell john where i was at or how

4598
03:06:18,318 --> 03:06:21,680
to get in contact with me and i demo

4599
03:06:20,239 --> 03:06:24,559
better take care of it because he was

4600
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:24,559
getting tired of it

4601
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:30,159
i learned a long time ago it's not wise

4602
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:32,000
to cross my father

4603
03:06:30,159 --> 03:06:34,318
he has a nasty habit of getting what he

4604
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,318
wants

4605
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:41,439
but i didn't respond to it immediately

4606
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:44,079
for two reasons

4607
03:06:41,439 --> 03:06:46,559
one i did not know john lear

4608
03:06:44,079 --> 03:06:46,559
and two

4609
03:06:47,200 --> 03:06:52,079
i really didn't feel

4610
03:06:49,760 --> 03:06:55,439
that it was necessary at that point for

4611
03:06:52,079 --> 03:06:55,439
me to come out of the closet

4612
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:58,560
and announced that the rumors of my

4613
03:06:57,279 --> 03:07:01,520
demise

4614
03:06:58,559 --> 03:07:01,519
were exaggerated

4615
03:07:02,739 --> 03:07:07,119
[Music]

4616
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:08,800
at this point

4617
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:10,399
i would like to take the opportunity i

4618
03:07:08,799 --> 03:07:11,840
don't know if mr anders is here but i

4619
03:07:10,398 --> 03:07:14,159
would like to take the opportunity to

4620
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:15,600
thank mr andres

4621
03:07:14,159 --> 03:07:17,680
because mr andrews is directly

4622
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:20,239
responsible for me contacting wendell

4623
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,239
stevens

4624
03:07:22,159 --> 03:07:29,520
mr andrews made a statement

4625
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:29,520
to abc news i believe it was

4626
03:07:30,639 --> 03:07:35,840
the statement was so out of character

4627
03:07:32,239 --> 03:07:35,840
for what i knew from walt anders

4628
03:07:36,318 --> 03:07:41,760
but i had to consider it very carefully

4629
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:44,959
while working at the radio station i had

4630
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:46,559
the opportunity to view the pre-feeds

4631
03:07:44,959 --> 03:07:48,159
that network sends down to radio

4632
03:07:46,559 --> 03:07:49,920
stations so that you'll have an idea of

4633
03:07:48,159 --> 03:07:51,600
what is going to come down the network

4634
03:07:49,920 --> 03:07:53,439
news

4635
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:55,680
in that statement mr andrews said that

4636
03:07:53,439 --> 03:07:58,079
there are aliens on earth that we have

4637
03:07:55,680 --> 03:08:01,040
been invaded

4638
03:07:58,079 --> 03:08:01,039
and that they are here

4639
03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:06,920
i found this extremely out of character

4640
03:08:02,959 --> 03:08:06,919
for what i knew of mr anders

4641
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:10,960
it was not the conservative person that

4642
03:08:09,359 --> 03:08:12,399
i had known

4643
03:08:10,959 --> 03:08:16,239
certainly wasn't the person that had

4644
03:08:12,398 --> 03:08:18,159
been described to me by coral lorenzen

4645
03:08:16,239 --> 03:08:21,359
which i might add at that time was not

4646
03:08:18,159 --> 03:08:23,600
complementary at all

4647
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:27,520
but shortly thereafter i was on coral's

4648
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:27,520
list also so it didn't matter much

4649
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:32,318
and i knew that i had made it wherever

4650
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:35,680
made it was because i was at the top of

4651
03:08:32,318 --> 03:08:37,439
her list of people to avoid and to hate

4652
03:08:35,680 --> 03:08:39,520
i might add at this point i have the

4653
03:08:37,439 --> 03:08:43,200
dubious honor of being the only person

4654
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:43,200
that coral has tried to sue

4655
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:48,479
when coral did that

4656
03:08:46,079 --> 03:08:51,680
i knew then and there

4657
03:08:48,478 --> 03:08:51,679
that i had reached the top

4658
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:58,399
but i will say this if corll and jim

4659
03:08:54,879 --> 03:08:58,398
lorenzen they have my

4660
03:08:58,478 --> 03:09:00,879
honor

4661
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:05,120
they have my admiration whatever my

4662
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:08,000
personal feelings about jim and cora

4663
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:10,640
lorenzen might be

4664
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:12,478
they had the courage to do something

4665
03:09:10,639 --> 03:09:15,799
that nobody else did and they were the

4666
03:09:12,478 --> 03:09:15,799
very first

4667
03:09:16,318 --> 03:09:20,238
their work

4668
03:09:18,559 --> 03:09:22,959
made it possible

4669
03:09:20,238 --> 03:09:27,478
for all of you to be here today

4670
03:09:22,959 --> 03:09:27,478
and for that i am eternally grateful

4671
03:09:28,659 --> 03:09:34,280
[Applause]

4672
03:09:34,318 --> 03:09:40,079
to continue and i apologize for

4673
03:09:36,959 --> 03:09:44,119
digressing and going off into tangents

4674
03:09:40,079 --> 03:09:44,120
but that's the way i am

4675
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:49,840
i read the statement that mr andrews had

4676
03:09:47,359 --> 03:09:52,960
made on the wire service

4677
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:52,960
i said this can't be right

4678
03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:56,799
i don't believe this

4679
03:09:57,200 --> 03:10:01,600
after so many years

4680
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:04,318
somebody

4681
03:10:01,600 --> 03:10:04,318
of repute

4682
03:10:04,398 --> 03:10:08,238
came forward and said yes it's true

4683
03:10:09,279 --> 03:10:13,840
it was like a load was lifted off my

4684
03:10:11,279 --> 03:10:13,840
back

4685
03:10:14,559 --> 03:10:18,639
that very night i contacted wendell

4686
03:10:16,398 --> 03:10:21,519
stevens and said wendell

4687
03:10:18,639 --> 03:10:21,519
he said yes

4688
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:24,559
who the hell are you

4689
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:30,079
bill english

4690
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:32,880


4691
03:10:30,079 --> 03:10:35,039
not really it's bill english wendell

4692
03:10:32,879 --> 03:10:36,559
where the hell are you

4693
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:38,239
i'm in virginia

4694
03:10:36,559 --> 03:10:40,000
virginia

4695
03:10:38,238 --> 03:10:43,840
i heard you were dead we thought you

4696
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:43,840
were dead where have you been

4697
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:51,040
so i rehashed the scenario with wendell

4698
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:52,318
wendell being

4699
03:10:51,040 --> 03:10:54,239
a little bit more aware of what the

4700
03:10:52,318 --> 03:10:55,439
circumstances were at the time and why i

4701
03:10:54,238 --> 03:10:58,000
disappeared

4702
03:10:55,439 --> 03:11:01,359
could understand it

4703
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:01,359
he told me you know you're in a book

4704
03:11:02,879 --> 03:11:06,398
which i responded no

4705
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:11,359
said yeah fella by the name of bill

4706
03:11:08,959 --> 03:11:14,318
steinman and i wrote a book

4707
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:14,318
well i helped him

4708
03:11:14,559 --> 03:11:18,000
no kidding

4709
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:20,559
how do i get a copy of the book

4710
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:22,959
well i'll send you one

4711
03:11:20,559 --> 03:11:24,238
say can i tell anybody that you're uh

4712
03:11:22,959 --> 03:11:26,079
you're still there

4713
03:11:24,238 --> 03:11:28,719
hell no

4714
03:11:26,079 --> 03:11:32,159
i don't want anybody to know i'm here

4715
03:11:28,719 --> 03:11:33,920
send me the book and i'll talk to you

4716
03:11:32,159 --> 03:11:37,840
several days later i received the book

4717
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:37,840
in the mail and i sat down and read it

4718
03:11:38,478 --> 03:11:42,318
and i was greatly disturbed at what i

4719
03:11:40,079 --> 03:11:42,318
read

4720
03:11:42,879 --> 03:11:46,959
not because

4721
03:11:44,559 --> 03:11:48,719
what was in the book was a lie it wasn't

4722
03:11:46,959 --> 03:11:51,039
the information that was in the book was

4723
03:11:48,719 --> 03:11:54,318
extremely accurate

4724
03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:58,399
wendell had very faithfully seen to it

4725
03:11:54,318 --> 03:11:58,398
that all the information was there

4726
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:04,960
i was disturbed because after so many

4727
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:07,040
years i was forced to sit down

4728
03:12:04,959 --> 03:12:08,959
and remember

4729
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:12,640
the circumstances

4730
03:12:08,959 --> 03:12:12,639
that brought me to that point in my life

4731
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:20,318
i then sat down with my wife

4732
03:12:17,279 --> 03:12:24,319
he said valerie i want you to read this

4733
03:12:20,318 --> 03:12:24,318
this is who i am this is what i'm about

4734
03:12:24,398 --> 03:12:27,840
it's finally come out in the open

4735
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:34,000
she read

4736
03:12:31,840 --> 03:12:36,719
she said is it true

4737
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,719
i said yes

4738
03:12:38,079 --> 03:12:41,439
then she said what are you going to do

4739
03:12:39,279 --> 03:12:43,600
about it what are we going to do about

4740
03:12:41,439 --> 03:12:43,600
it

4741
03:12:45,040 --> 03:12:50,720
i said well

4742
03:12:46,959 --> 03:12:50,719
what should we do about it i don't know

4743
03:12:51,680 --> 03:12:54,880
i said well boy you better get off your

4744
03:12:53,359 --> 03:12:56,479
ass and get out there and start talking

4745
03:12:54,879 --> 03:12:58,079
about it because it's obvious somebody

4746
03:12:56,478 --> 03:13:02,238
out there knows what's going on and they

4747
03:12:58,079 --> 03:13:02,238
had better get the straight information

4748
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:10,238
when she said that i fell in love with

4749
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:10,239
that lady all over again

4750
03:13:12,879 --> 03:13:16,398
she had more courage than i did

4751
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:22,000
either that or she was extremely naive

4752
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:27,960
but i like to think she was courageous

4753
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:34,000
so after reading the book and going

4754
03:13:32,079 --> 03:13:36,719
through all that i finally contacted

4755
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,719
john lear

4756
03:13:36,799 --> 03:13:42,759
first time i contacted him i posed as

4757
03:13:38,959 --> 03:13:42,759
bill english's lawyer

4758
03:13:43,600 --> 03:13:47,200
called him up and said i'm mr english's

4759
03:13:45,600 --> 03:13:48,640
lawyer legal attorney he told me to

4760
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:51,040
contact you and find out what the hell

4761
03:13:48,639 --> 03:13:51,039
you want

4762
03:13:51,760 --> 03:13:54,639
john told

4763
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:56,399
the lawyer

4764
03:13:54,639 --> 03:13:58,079
what he wanted

4765
03:13:56,398 --> 03:14:00,478
he was very honest very straightforward

4766
03:13:58,079 --> 03:14:00,478
about it

4767
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:05,920
i thanked him hung up

4768
03:14:08,559 --> 03:14:12,159
and then i didn't call him back for

4769
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:15,439
about two weeks

4770
03:14:12,159 --> 03:14:16,959
well i considered everything

4771
03:14:15,439 --> 03:14:18,720
finally at the end of two weeks i called

4772
03:14:16,959 --> 03:14:21,919
him back

4773
03:14:18,719 --> 03:14:21,920
we talked for a few minutes

4774
03:14:22,238 --> 03:14:27,359
he asked if he could meet me in virginia

4775
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:27,359
and i said yes please do

4776
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:31,920
and a great inconvenience to him and at

4777
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:34,398
much expense

4778
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:38,639
he flew to virginia to meet me

4779
03:14:34,398 --> 03:14:40,639
where i met him at the lynchburg airport

4780
03:14:38,639 --> 03:14:42,398
immediately upon his arrival for the

4781
03:14:40,639 --> 03:14:45,039
first time in

4782
03:14:42,398 --> 03:14:47,840
eight years

4783
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:47,840
we were followed

4784
03:14:48,159 --> 03:14:52,439
the government knew where i was at

4785
03:14:56,318 --> 03:15:01,199
john came into the airport terminal i

4786
03:14:58,318 --> 03:15:02,959
was wearing a beard grubby old levi's

4787
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:05,120
the blue vest that many of you have seen

4788
03:15:02,959 --> 03:15:08,799
me walking around here in the last few

4789
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:08,800
days my lucky vest

4790
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:14,318
he sat down he had no idea what i looked

4791
03:15:12,079 --> 03:15:16,959
like i sat down next to him waited for a

4792
03:15:14,318 --> 03:15:18,159
couple of minutes

4793
03:15:16,959 --> 03:15:20,799
turned around and looked at him and said

4794
03:15:18,159 --> 03:15:22,398
you can buy me a drink let's go

4795
03:15:20,799 --> 03:15:24,478
and john being the trooper and he is

4796
03:15:22,398 --> 03:15:26,318
didn't say a word

4797
03:15:24,478 --> 03:15:28,238
got up grabbed his bag walked out the

4798
03:15:26,318 --> 03:15:30,879
door

4799
03:15:28,238 --> 03:15:32,639
our trails followed us out the door

4800
03:15:30,879 --> 03:15:37,119
we jumped in john's car and headed to a

4801
03:15:32,639 --> 03:15:37,119
local bar where john bought me a drink

4802
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:43,200
two gentlemen followed us into the bar

4803
03:15:40,959 --> 03:15:46,318
john and i scooted out of the bar

4804
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:46,319
and headed for my home

4805
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:50,640
the next few days

4806
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:53,359
john

4807
03:15:54,719 --> 03:16:01,079
very graciously but very thoroughly

4808
03:15:57,680 --> 03:16:01,079
grilled me

4809
03:16:02,398 --> 03:16:07,439
reminded me of things that i had not

4810
03:16:04,159 --> 03:16:07,439
remembered for many years

4811
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:14,000
my chief concern when i spoke to mr lear

4812
03:16:12,238 --> 03:16:17,279
was i did not know him and i did not

4813
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:19,040
want to come off as an idiot

4814
03:16:17,279 --> 03:16:22,159
i did not want him to think that i was

4815
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:22,160
another nut case

4816
03:16:26,478 --> 03:16:32,000
it wasn't until about a month later when

4817
03:16:28,639 --> 03:16:33,840
mr lear sent me a copy of his report on

4818
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:36,398
meeting with me

4819
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:38,478
that i finally had an idea of what he

4820
03:16:36,398 --> 03:16:40,478
thought of me

4821
03:16:38,478 --> 03:16:44,039
and i was deeply gratified to see that

4822
03:16:40,478 --> 03:16:44,039
he believed me

4823
03:16:46,639 --> 03:16:52,719
mr lear is officially retiring from

4824
03:16:48,719 --> 03:16:52,719
active ufo investigations

4825
03:16:54,398 --> 03:16:58,278
and i cry for it

4826
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:03,600
objectively has not been in the field

4827
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:06,398
for very long but what he has done has

4828
03:17:03,600 --> 03:17:06,399
been phenomenal

4829
03:17:08,238 --> 03:17:12,079
mr lear

4830
03:17:10,398 --> 03:17:15,439
is perhaps

4831
03:17:12,079 --> 03:17:15,439
one of the finest men i know

4832
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:23,120
whatever else you might think of him as

4833
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:24,840
an investigator

4834
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:28,960
as a controversial

4835
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:28,960
figure as a human being

4836
03:17:29,359 --> 03:17:32,720
the man

4837
03:17:30,398 --> 03:17:34,799
has heart

4838
03:17:32,719 --> 03:17:37,329
and there's damn few of us anymore that

4839
03:17:34,799 --> 03:17:45,679
can say that about anybody

4840
03:17:37,329 --> 03:17:49,920
[Applause]

4841
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:49,920
now that i've covered for the most part

4842
03:17:50,559 --> 03:17:54,478
what i've had to say with review

4843
03:17:52,799 --> 03:17:56,318
regard to reviewing some of the

4844
03:17:54,478 --> 03:17:58,719
circumstances which have brought me here

4845
03:17:56,318 --> 03:17:58,719
tonight

4846
03:17:59,359 --> 03:18:04,640
it's now necessary for me to address the

4847
03:18:01,600 --> 03:18:04,640
question of mr moore

4848
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:11,600
last night mr moore stood up here and

4849
03:18:09,439 --> 03:18:13,279
said we must stop the character

4850
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:16,318
assassination

4851
03:18:13,279 --> 03:18:19,479
we must stop the infighting we must stop

4852
03:18:16,318 --> 03:18:19,478
the disinformation

4853
03:18:22,159 --> 03:18:27,039
and as he was saying that i was walking

4854
03:18:24,159 --> 03:18:29,200
around the back of this auditorium

4855
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:30,960
about ready to pop a cork because the

4856
03:18:29,200 --> 03:18:33,200
man was standing there

4857
03:18:30,959 --> 03:18:34,629
telling you a bald-faced lie

4858
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:38,560
yeah

4859
03:18:34,629 --> 03:18:40,079
[Applause]

4860
03:18:38,559 --> 03:18:42,639
he has not stopped the character

4861
03:18:40,079 --> 03:18:45,600
assassination and he never did

4862
03:18:42,639 --> 03:18:45,599
nine months ago

4863
03:18:46,238 --> 03:18:50,920
when mr moore discovered that i had

4864
03:18:47,920 --> 03:18:50,920
resurfaced

4865
03:18:52,079 --> 03:18:57,039
he was asked by two engineers from

4866
03:18:53,840 --> 03:18:57,040
aerojet corporation

4867
03:18:57,120 --> 03:19:02,720
what he thought of me and my viewing of

4868
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:05,600
the documents that i said i had viewed

4869
03:19:02,719 --> 03:19:07,920
to which he responded

4870
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:10,238
bill english told me that he and jerry

4871
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:14,000
schultz were doing lsd

4872
03:19:10,238 --> 03:19:14,000
when they wrote the blue book summation

4873
03:19:14,639 --> 03:19:18,318
this is a documented fact bill did in

4874
03:19:16,559 --> 03:19:20,398
fact say this and i have a letter from

4875
03:19:18,318 --> 03:19:22,639
him stating that he said it and i have

4876
03:19:20,398 --> 03:19:24,639
that letter here today

4877
03:19:22,639 --> 03:19:26,318
it's in the posses possession of mr john

4878
03:19:24,639 --> 03:19:28,639
lear because i gave it to him yesterday

4879
03:19:26,318 --> 03:19:28,639
morning

4880
03:19:30,879 --> 03:19:35,920
that statement is an out and out lie

4881
03:19:34,079 --> 03:19:38,000
i never made such a statement to mr

4882
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:41,760
moore

4883
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:41,760
in fact i do not do drugs

4884
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:47,840
i have a hard time taking drugs even

4885
03:19:43,920 --> 03:19:47,840
those are prescribed by the doctor

4886
03:19:52,639 --> 03:19:55,840
i said nothing at that point because i

4887
03:19:54,398 --> 03:19:59,159
wanted to wait and see what else was

4888
03:19:55,840 --> 03:19:59,159
going to happen

4889
03:20:00,959 --> 03:20:07,119
then mr moore came out with that fukaka

4890
03:20:03,439 --> 03:20:08,800
ufo television show of his

4891
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:12,399
which in my estimation was designed to

4892
03:20:08,799 --> 03:20:15,759
do nothing more than discredit

4893
03:20:12,398 --> 03:20:19,119
the science of ufology

4894
03:20:15,760 --> 03:20:19,120
and that's exactly what it did

4895
03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:24,079
it was poorly produced

4896
03:20:21,279 --> 03:20:24,079
poorly written

4897
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:31,680
and it made ufo investigators look like

4898
03:20:28,318 --> 03:20:31,680
absolute utter idiots

4899
03:20:32,559 --> 03:20:36,238
and it was the cruelest blow that

4900
03:20:34,238 --> 03:20:41,238
anybody

4901
03:20:36,238 --> 03:20:41,238
could have hit ufo investigators with

4902
03:20:42,238 --> 03:20:47,119
dad insult to injury

4903
03:20:45,279 --> 03:20:49,600
mr moore

4904
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:52,160
had his two buzzards

4905
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:52,159
pronounce

4906
03:20:54,719 --> 03:20:59,199
the stuff

4907
03:20:56,799 --> 03:21:02,079
that he said i'd been lying about

4908
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:02,079
for 13 years

4909
03:21:02,398 --> 03:21:10,039
word for word they parroted everything

4910
03:21:05,439 --> 03:21:10,040
that i had told him in 1979.

4911
03:21:11,760 --> 03:21:16,000
one hour after viewing this travesty i

4912
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:19,439
got on the telephone to alan benz and

4913
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:19,439
got mr morris phone number

4914
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:25,238
allen is here tonight he will confirm

4915
03:21:22,238 --> 03:21:25,238
this

4916
03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:35,120
bill was in washington dc

4917
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:35,120
i spoke with mr chandra

4918
03:21:36,799 --> 03:21:41,039
i told mr chandra

4919
03:21:38,959 --> 03:21:42,639
that i wanted a piece of mr amore's ass

4920
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:46,000
so bad i was ready to crawl through the

4921
03:21:42,639 --> 03:21:46,000
phone and bite him on the air

4922
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:55,359
i told mr chandra that that show was

4923
03:21:52,799 --> 03:21:55,358


4924
03:21:56,238 --> 03:22:00,639
that a man who for 12 years had said

4925
03:21:58,398 --> 03:22:02,159
that bill english is a liar and a drug

4926
03:22:00,639 --> 03:22:03,920
addict

4927
03:22:02,159 --> 03:22:05,600
and a paranoid schizophrenic and every

4928
03:22:03,920 --> 03:22:08,159
kind of perverse son of a that you

4929
03:22:05,600 --> 03:22:08,159
can imagine

4930
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:12,479
produced a television show

4931
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:17,920
that parroted everything that i had been

4932
03:22:15,920 --> 03:22:21,559
saying

4933
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:21,559
for 12 years

4934
03:22:23,120 --> 03:22:27,600
my question at that time was if i'm such

4935
03:22:25,520 --> 03:22:29,520
a liar

4936
03:22:27,600 --> 03:22:34,040
why would you produce a piece of crap

4937
03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:34,040
like this and have someone say that

4938
03:22:37,840 --> 03:22:41,120
my question now is

4939
03:22:41,359 --> 03:22:45,439
after producing that piece of

4940
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:48,000
why would you stand in front of an

4941
03:22:45,439 --> 03:22:49,439
audience of qualified intelligent people

4942
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:52,799
and tell them that it was a

4943
03:22:49,439 --> 03:22:52,800
disinformation ploy

4944
03:22:54,238 --> 03:22:57,719
another lie

4945
03:23:02,639 --> 03:23:05,760
quite frankly

4946
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:08,159
if mr moore is not in this for the money

4947
03:23:05,760 --> 03:23:10,079
then what the hell is he in it for

4948
03:23:08,159 --> 03:23:13,600
he's not done any good for ufo

4949
03:23:10,079 --> 03:23:13,600
investigation that i can determine

4950
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:17,478
except heard it

4951
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:24,960
i would like to take this opportunity

4952
03:23:22,559 --> 03:23:26,159
right now to apologize to you and to

4953
03:23:24,959 --> 03:23:29,119

who support mr moore

4955
03:23:29,120 --> 03:23:32,160
but facts are facts

4956
03:23:34,398 --> 03:23:37,680

4957

4958
03:23:41,520 --> 03:23:46,159

4963

4966
03:24:04,398 --> 03:24:08,559

4967
03:24:06,079 --> 03:24:08,559
anymore

4968
03:24:10,159 --> 03:24:13,559
i do know

4969
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:17,439
that we as a body

4970
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:20,720
must pull together

4971
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:23,120
not only in muthons

4972
03:24:20,719 --> 03:24:27,559
but in kufos

4973

center for international ufo studies

4974
03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:31,359
all

4975
03:24:31,520 --> 03:24:36,640
of the ufo organizations

4976
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:38,840
that are in existence today

4977
03:24:36,639 --> 03:24:41,519
must put aside their political

4978
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:43,760
aspirations must put aside the politics

4979
03:24:41,520 --> 03:24:47,520
of their organization

4980
03:24:43,760 --> 03:24:47,520
must put aside their personal feelings

4981
03:24:48,799 --> 03:24:51,438
we must

4982
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:55,000
it's imperative if we're going to

4983
03:24:51,439 --> 03:24:55,000
accomplish anything

4984
03:24:55,920 --> 03:25:02,159

4988
03:25:07,120 --> 03:25:10,560

can gather together

true or not true

5041
03:27:33,200 --> 03:27:38,479
more solid foundation

5042
03:27:36,238 --> 03:27:40,639
for this science of ours

5043
03:27:38,478 --> 03:27:43,840
and that's exactly what this is

5044
03:27:40,639 --> 03:27:47,278
this is a science

5045
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:49,840
we have no established criteria per se

5046
03:27:47,279 --> 03:27:51,439
for investigators

5047
03:27:49,840 --> 03:27:52,398
but we hope eventually that will take

5048
03:27:51,439 --> 03:27:54,479
place

5049
03:27:52,398 --> 03:27:56,398
and that ufology will be recognized as a

5050
03:27:54,478 --> 03:27:59,599
genuine

5051
03:27:56,398 --> 03:27:59,599

5074
03:29:07,279 --> 03:29:12,079
thing i know about the philadelphia

5075
03:29:08,719 --> 03:29:14,799
experiment is what i saw in the movie

5076
03:29:12,079 --> 03:29:16,719
i cannot give you a qualified opinion

5077
03:29:14,799 --> 03:29:18,079
about the book

5078
03:29:16,719 --> 03:29:19,920
and what was the rest of your question

5079
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:23,600
well i was wondering in connection with

5080
03:29:19,920 --> 03:29:25,920
that about the mystery connected with

5081
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:28,318
um einstein's involvement with the

5082
03:29:25,920 --> 03:29:30,799
philadelphia experiment

5083
03:29:28,318 --> 03:29:32,879
and the rumors

5084
03:29:30,799 --> 03:29:34,719
about

5085
03:29:32,879 --> 03:29:36,799
marilyn monroe being not only beautiful

5086
03:29:34,719 --> 03:29:40,398
but intelligent and her connection with

5087
03:29:36,799 --> 03:29:42,559
the kennedys and why jackie kennedy

5088
03:29:40,398 --> 03:29:44,318
kept quiet about everything

5089
03:29:42,559 --> 03:29:45,039
was she also perhaps in fear for her

5090
03:29:44,318 --> 03:29:46,959
life

5091
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:48,880

03:29:48,879 --> 03:29:52,238

employee

5103
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:15,719

03:30:11,359 --> 03:30:15,720
defense security services command

5105
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:20,079
a

5106
03:30:18,318 --> 03:30:21,920
document came across my desk in a

5107
03:30:20,079 --> 03:30:24,079
diplomatic pouch for the disposition

5108
03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:25,600
form instructing me to analyze the

5109
03:30:24,079 --> 03:30:28,719
document

5110
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:32,238
assign it a probability rate

5111
03:30:28,719 --> 03:30:32,238
as to whether or not it was true

5112
03:30:32,559 --> 03:30:36,478
whatever

5113
03:30:34,559 --> 03:30:38,079
all i did was my job

5114
03:30:36,478 --> 03:30:41,840
which was essentially analyze the

5115
03:30:38,079 --> 03:30:44,799
document that was presented in my inbox

5116
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:46,880
and write a summation of it

5117
03:30:44,799 --> 03:30:48,799
thank you

5118
03:30:46,879 --> 03:30:50,318
yes bill will you discourse at length

5119
03:30:48,799 --> 03:30:52,639
about some of the contents of this

5120
03:30:50,318 --> 03:30:54,159
document and just get into it for about

5121
03:30:52,639 --> 03:30:55,599
five minutes and tell us some of the

5122
03:30:54,159 --> 03:30:57,680
things that you saw

5123
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:58,960
and above all some of your feelings

5124
03:30:57,680 --> 03:31:00,720
towards this material what were you

5125
03:30:58,959 --> 03:31:02,478
feeling how did it what was it like to

5126
03:31:00,719 --> 03:31:03,920
read this and tell us about this

5127
03:31:02,478 --> 03:31:06,079
material because

5128
03:31:03,920 --> 03:31:08,398
as a ufologist i'm more interested in

5129
03:31:06,079 --> 03:31:10,238
the flying saucers than i am about the

5130
03:31:08,398 --> 03:31:11,979
petty squabbles between the researchers

5131
03:31:10,238 --> 03:31:16,639
you know what i mean

5132
03:31:11,979 --> 03:31:18,398
[Applause]

5133
03:31:16,639 --> 03:31:20,238
at the time when i read the document it

5134
03:31:18,398 --> 03:31:22,318
was reported in the document that the

5135
03:31:20,238 --> 03:31:25,680
united states had in its possession

5136
03:31:22,318 --> 03:31:28,079
several ufos

5137
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:29,760
technological reports showed

5138
03:31:28,079 --> 03:31:32,959
that on

5139
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:34,639
a few of them they had been dismantled

5140
03:31:32,959 --> 03:31:37,039
there was a photograph of what was

5141
03:31:34,639 --> 03:31:39,358
labeled as an atomic generator or a

5142
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:42,319
nuclear power unit which was no bigger

5143
03:31:39,359 --> 03:31:42,318
than a basketball

5144
03:31:42,559 --> 03:31:45,920
the inside of the craft

5145
03:31:46,398 --> 03:31:49,840
apparently

5146
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:50,960
showed apparently what were control

5147
03:31:49,840 --> 03:31:53,120
boards

5148
03:31:50,959 --> 03:31:54,719
with strange writing on them i'm not a

5149
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:57,359
linguist so i couldn't begin to tell you

5150
03:31:54,719 --> 03:31:57,358
what it said

5151
03:31:57,680 --> 03:32:00,000
uh

5152
03:32:00,159 --> 03:32:02,959
there was there was a great deal of

5153
03:32:01,680 --> 03:32:04,960
stuff

5154
03:32:02,959 --> 03:32:06,879
a lot of things that just

5155
03:32:04,959 --> 03:32:10,000
dealt most i was more interested to be

5156
03:32:06,879 --> 03:32:11,839
honest with you in the autopsy pictures

5157
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:16,159
several of the autopsy pictures showed

5158
03:32:11,840 --> 03:32:16,159
alien cadavers on autopsy tables

5159
03:32:16,398 --> 03:32:19,358
that have been

5160
03:32:17,520 --> 03:32:21,279
vivisectioned

5161
03:32:19,359 --> 03:32:23,120
several photographs showed an alien head

5162
03:32:21,279 --> 03:32:27,040
which had been removed from the body cut

5163
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:28,880
in half which showed brain casings

5164
03:32:27,040 --> 03:32:31,359
some of these photographs were in color

5165
03:32:28,879 --> 03:32:33,839
some of them were in black and white

5166
03:32:31,359 --> 03:32:36,880
one particular photograph

5167
03:32:33,840 --> 03:32:39,439
that i remember distinctly was that of

5168
03:32:36,879 --> 03:32:41,358
three aliens shoved up what

5169
03:32:39,439 --> 03:32:43,520
shoved up against what appeared to be a

5170
03:32:41,359 --> 03:32:46,000
white tile wall

5171
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:48,000
in which

5172
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:51,840
they looked very confused and a

5173
03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:51,840
photograph of them was taken

5174
03:32:52,719 --> 03:32:57,278
i'm sorry

5175
03:32:54,559 --> 03:32:57,278
live aliens

5176
03:32:57,520 --> 03:33:01,040
does that answer your question yes sir

5177
03:32:59,359 --> 03:33:03,279
may

5178
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:06,479
isn't it true bill that our government

5179
03:33:03,279 --> 03:33:08,880
believed for quite some time uh that

5180
03:33:06,478 --> 03:33:11,199
these greys boasted that they created

5181
03:33:08,879 --> 03:33:12,079
jesus christ

5182
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:13,680
i know

5183
03:33:12,079 --> 03:33:16,000
i know it's kind of heavy and i figured

5184
03:33:13,680 --> 03:33:19,840
i'd drop it on you it is rumored that

5185
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:19,840
this is in fact what has taken place

5186
03:33:20,159 --> 03:33:25,279
it's rumored that because of biogenetic

5187
03:33:22,799 --> 03:33:27,278
engineering jesus christ was engineered

5188
03:33:25,279 --> 03:33:29,680
by the aliens

5189
03:33:27,279 --> 03:33:31,760
quite honestly i have no knowledge of

5190
03:33:29,680 --> 03:33:34,960
this

5191
03:33:31,760 --> 03:33:34,960
i'm not a theologian

5192
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:39,040
and to be perfectly honest with you that

5193
03:33:37,040 --> 03:33:41,040
is a topic that i am afraid to even

5194
03:33:39,040 --> 03:33:43,040
approach for the simple fact that it is

5195
03:33:41,040 --> 03:33:44,960
so hot i would give you i appreciate

5196
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:47,680
that and thank you

5197
03:33:44,959 --> 03:33:50,398
yes sir yes as a

5198
03:33:47,680 --> 03:33:52,159
civilian employee

5199
03:33:50,398 --> 03:33:54,159
and privileged to that kind of

5200
03:33:52,159 --> 03:33:57,119
information i wonder what it was that

5201
03:33:54,159 --> 03:34:00,559
led to them flopping that on your desk

5202
03:33:57,120 --> 03:34:01,359
and what your direct reaction

5203
03:34:00,559 --> 03:34:03,760
to

5204
03:34:01,359 --> 03:34:05,200
information about ufos

5205
03:34:03,760 --> 03:34:07,840
were did you have any previous

5206
03:34:05,200 --> 03:34:09,920
orientation toward ufos or

5207
03:34:07,840 --> 03:34:13,960
perfectly frank with you i had no

5208
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:13,960
interest in ufos whatsoever

5209
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:18,120
i had no knowledge of them

5210
03:34:30,719 --> 03:34:34,079
we went into

5211
03:34:31,840 --> 03:34:35,680
we found the aircraft

5212
03:34:34,079 --> 03:34:37,520
we were supposed to bring out survivors

5213
03:34:35,680 --> 03:34:39,600
if there were any

5214
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:42,479
there were none

5215
03:34:39,600 --> 03:34:46,880
at that time i had no concept of ufos

5216
03:34:42,478 --> 03:34:49,438
ufology mutilations whatsoever

5217
03:34:46,879 --> 03:34:51,278
we found the entire crew

5218
03:34:49,439 --> 03:34:53,840
still in their safety harnesses in their

5219
03:34:51,279 --> 03:34:55,920
seat in the aircraft

5220
03:34:53,840 --> 03:34:57,600
the aircraft had not crashed it was

5221
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:59,120
perfectly intact

5222
03:34:57,600 --> 03:35:00,960
the only visible damage that we could

5223
03:34:59,120 --> 03:35:02,720
see was the fact that the engine pods

5224
03:35:00,959 --> 03:35:05,438
were damaged because the aircraft was

5225
03:35:02,719 --> 03:35:05,438
sitting on them

5226
03:35:07,279 --> 03:35:11,840
the crew

5227
03:35:08,959 --> 03:35:11,839
had been mutilated

5228
03:35:12,238 --> 03:35:17,840
in every classical sense of the word as

5229
03:35:14,159 --> 03:35:17,840
described by linda howell in her book

5230
03:35:21,439 --> 03:35:25,079
of cattle mutilations

5231
03:35:26,639 --> 03:35:31,439
we photographed the bodies

5232
03:35:29,200 --> 03:35:33,200
we grabbed dog tags

5233
03:35:31,439 --> 03:35:35,520
we destroyed the aircraft for the bodies

5234
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:35,520
in it

5235
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:40,478
we returned to our assigned base

5236
03:35:38,398 --> 03:35:42,398
the photographs were forwarded to mcphee

5237
03:35:40,478 --> 03:35:45,358
headquarters in saigon

5238
03:35:42,398 --> 03:35:47,599
this is the last i ever saw of them

5239
03:35:45,359 --> 03:35:51,040
until 1976 when they appeared in the

5240
03:35:47,600 --> 03:35:52,559
grudge blue book 13 report

5241
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:55,520
and i recognize them as being the

5242
03:35:52,559 --> 03:35:55,519
photographs that i took

5243
03:35:55,600 --> 03:36:00,800
so i had no doubt whatsoever the uh as

5244
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:02,719
to the authenticity of the document

5245
03:36:00,799 --> 03:36:05,679
do you think that they knew that handing

5246
03:36:02,719 --> 03:36:09,760
you the uh the file

5247
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:09,760
for your analysis it's entirely possible

5248
03:36:10,159 --> 03:36:16,478
it's entirely possible

5249
03:36:13,279 --> 03:36:19,279
i could have been set up i don't know

5250
03:36:16,478 --> 03:36:21,519
and then beyond that after you did

5251
03:36:19,279 --> 03:36:22,640
analyze it and write your report

5252
03:36:21,520 --> 03:36:24,238
d uh

5253
03:36:22,639 --> 03:36:26,719
i'm unfamiliar with that so i'm just

5254
03:36:24,238 --> 03:36:28,079
wondering if if that was what led

5255
03:36:26,719 --> 03:36:29,438
directly to

5256
03:36:28,079 --> 03:36:31,600
uh

5257
03:36:29,439 --> 03:36:32,800
your ousting in the service i believe it

5258
03:36:31,600 --> 03:36:34,479
was

5259
03:36:32,799 --> 03:36:35,519
i believe it was

5260
03:36:34,478 --> 03:36:37,278
thank you

5261
03:36:35,520 --> 03:36:40,720
next question please we're running short

5262
03:36:37,279 --> 03:36:42,399
on time i hope you don't feel slighted

5263
03:36:40,719 --> 03:36:44,238
if i cut you off but i'll try and get as

5264
03:36:42,398 --> 03:36:47,840
many in as i can so please make it brief

5265
03:36:44,238 --> 03:36:50,318
okay i understand you had uh one day to

5266
03:36:47,840 --> 03:36:52,159
analyze the report

5267
03:36:50,318 --> 03:36:53,920
that's the recollection i have from

5268
03:36:52,159 --> 03:36:55,760
reading about the report

5269
03:36:53,920 --> 03:36:58,079
and um

5270
03:36:55,760 --> 03:37:00,398
uh and it was not until sometime later

5271
03:36:58,079 --> 03:37:02,959
that you tried to reproduce the report

5272
03:37:00,398 --> 03:37:06,238
from memory i'm sorry i say you know it

5273
03:37:02,959 --> 03:37:07,679
was some time later when you uh tried to

5274
03:37:06,238 --> 03:37:09,359
kind of regenerate the report from

5275
03:37:07,680 --> 03:37:13,120
memory from your

5276
03:37:09,359 --> 03:37:14,720
uh one day or so can you characterize

5277
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:16,560
uh if you

5278
03:37:14,719 --> 03:37:19,519
think that your recollection of the

5279
03:37:16,559 --> 03:37:19,519
report was

5280
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:24,079
complete or or

5281
03:37:22,478 --> 03:37:25,920
to to what extent do you think you were

5282
03:37:24,079 --> 03:37:27,760
able to kind of regurgitate what you

5283
03:37:25,920 --> 03:37:30,398
actually saw

5284
03:37:27,760 --> 03:37:32,318
initially it was about 95

5285
03:37:30,398 --> 03:37:34,478
after 13 years it's probably a little

5286
03:37:32,318 --> 03:37:36,478
bit less

5287
03:37:34,478 --> 03:37:37,599
that's actually a very high percentage

5288
03:37:36,478 --> 03:37:40,079
is that just

5289
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:42,079
your talent i have an idyllic memory

5290
03:37:40,079 --> 03:37:46,159
okay your wife

5291
03:37:42,079 --> 03:37:49,120
you're what i have an idyllic memory

5292
03:37:46,159 --> 03:37:51,920
i did it i did i did it all right yeah

5293
03:37:49,120 --> 03:37:53,840
i got it but i can't say it

5294
03:37:51,920 --> 03:37:56,719
yes sir we were shown a

5295
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:59,200
videotape narrated by rod serling of the

5296
03:37:56,719 --> 03:38:02,799
landing at holloman air force base

5297
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:04,880
and the aliens faces were described with

5298
03:38:02,799 --> 03:38:06,398
large noses

5299
03:38:04,879 --> 03:38:07,920
and

5300
03:38:06,398 --> 03:38:09,920
that contradicts most of the

5301
03:38:07,920 --> 03:38:11,520
descriptions we've heard about

5302
03:38:09,920 --> 03:38:13,120
the

5303
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:15,279
well the popularly published

5304
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:17,279
descriptions of the aliens

5305
03:38:15,279 --> 03:38:19,600
the photos that you saw of the cadavers

5306
03:38:17,279 --> 03:38:21,359
did they suggest faces like those that

5307
03:38:19,600 --> 03:38:23,359
we saw in that tape and how do you

5308
03:38:21,359 --> 03:38:24,880
explain that discrepancy uh some of the

5309
03:38:23,359 --> 03:38:26,559
gentlemen walking around here with these

5310
03:38:24,879 --> 03:38:29,278
strange white tags hanging off their

5311
03:38:26,559 --> 03:38:30,959
collars it's a picture of an alien that

5312
03:38:29,279 --> 03:38:32,560
pretty much characterized what they look

5313
03:38:30,959 --> 03:38:34,398
like

5314
03:38:32,559 --> 03:38:36,559
in the pictures that i saw it's entirely

5315
03:38:34,398 --> 03:38:39,840
possible that those aliens which landed

5316
03:38:36,559 --> 03:38:42,398
at holloman air force base

5317
03:38:39,840 --> 03:38:44,639
we're of a different species i do not

5318
03:38:42,398 --> 03:38:44,639
know

5319
03:38:47,920 --> 03:38:53,279
i have a question about

5320
03:38:50,559 --> 03:38:55,359
a book that i discovered

5321
03:38:53,279 --> 03:38:57,279
being mentioned in the flying saucer

5322
03:38:55,359 --> 03:38:59,359
review

5323
03:38:57,279 --> 03:39:02,079
in fact being debunked and ridiculed

5324
03:38:59,359 --> 03:39:05,600
there and actually found a bookstore in

5325
03:39:02,079 --> 03:39:08,318
los angeles the book called rancher

5326
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:11,279
and when i opened it uh the thing that

5327
03:39:08,318 --> 03:39:13,278
grabbed my attention was mentioning of

5328
03:39:11,279 --> 03:39:15,120
university super university central

5329
03:39:13,279 --> 03:39:16,000
universities local universities and so

5330
03:39:15,120 --> 03:39:17,920
on

5331
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:20,079
and having some

5332
03:39:17,920 --> 03:39:22,000
background in physics in engineering and

5333
03:39:20,079 --> 03:39:24,000
being interested in different dimensions

5334
03:39:22,000 --> 03:39:25,279
i said well gee interesting

5335
03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:26,398
got the book

5336
03:39:25,279 --> 03:39:28,800
and

5337
03:39:26,398 --> 03:39:31,358
i've been reading it carefully all these

5338
03:39:28,799 --> 03:39:32,519
months it was

5339
03:39:31,359 --> 03:39:35,199
written in

5340
03:39:32,520 --> 03:39:36,960
3435 translated into english in the

5341
03:39:35,199 --> 03:39:39,040
subsequent years

5342
03:39:36,959 --> 03:39:40,478
probably distributed through

5343
03:39:39,040 --> 03:39:44,160
your points are pleased we're running

5344
03:39:40,478 --> 03:39:47,519
short on time my question is did you

5345
03:39:44,159 --> 03:39:49,840
find any mentioning of this book in the

5346
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:52,000
documents that you came in contact with

5347
03:39:49,840 --> 03:39:54,079
because in the book there are many

5348
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:56,719
chapters that will describe alien

5349
03:39:54,079 --> 03:39:58,719
anatomies of different dozens of cases

5350
03:39:56,719 --> 03:40:00,799
well first of all i'm not familiar with

5351
03:39:58,719 --> 03:40:02,719
the book what i saw in the document was

5352
03:40:00,799 --> 03:40:05,358
technically oriented there was made

5353
03:40:02,719 --> 03:40:07,920
mention of the possibility

5354
03:40:05,359 --> 03:40:09,359
of uh interdimensional travel but at

5355
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:10,398
that point

5356
03:40:09,359 --> 03:40:11,920
and now

5357
03:40:10,398 --> 03:40:14,318
i have no knowledge of physics

5358
03:40:11,920 --> 03:40:16,398
whatsoever so i could not answer you

5359
03:40:14,318 --> 03:40:19,278
it's not a book about dimensions it's

5360
03:40:16,398 --> 03:40:20,959
more a book about life in the universe

5361
03:40:19,279 --> 03:40:22,720
and the different types of beings in the

5362
03:40:20,959 --> 03:40:25,119
universe and they would have chapters

5363
03:40:22,719 --> 03:40:27,840
and chapters of a listing of different

5364
03:40:25,120 --> 03:40:30,079
biological types of entities a lot of

5365
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:32,079
knowledge in chemistry and physics

5366
03:40:30,079 --> 03:40:34,000
astronomy and so on having not read the

5367
03:40:32,079 --> 03:40:36,559
book i can't give you an honest and

5368
03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:39,920
qualified answer last question

5369
03:40:36,559 --> 03:40:42,079
yes sir bill uh we knew that the aliens

5370
03:40:39,920 --> 03:40:45,359
are very good at telepathy

5371
03:40:42,079 --> 03:40:48,959
now if in the early days the aliens were

5372
03:40:45,359 --> 03:40:51,279
mistreated by uh humans don't you think

5373
03:40:48,959 --> 03:40:52,639
that that was conveyed to the alien

nation

5375
03:40:52,639 --> 03:40:58,559
early on and as a result i mean don't

5376
03:40:55,920 --> 03:41:01,199
you think they're waiting to get even or

5377
03:40:58,559 --> 03:41:03,119
have gotten even

5378
03:41:01,199 --> 03:41:05,279
well

5379
03:41:03,120 --> 03:41:07,920
not being telepathic i can't answer that

5380
03:41:05,279 --> 03:41:10,079
question unfortunately

5381
03:41:07,920 --> 03:41:13,600
if they are telepathic i would imagine

5382
03:41:10,079 --> 03:41:14,959
that if one knows they all know

5383
03:41:13,600 --> 03:41:16,960
ladies and gentlemen i'd like to thank

5384
03:41:14,959 --> 03:41:21,159
you very much for allowing me this time

5385
03:41:16,959 --> 03:41:21,159
and thank you for listening to me

that's absolutely the worst introduction

03:42:03,520 --> 03:42:06,319
i have ever had

03:42:08,559 --> 03:42:12,318
you can't trust the males these days

i had really wanted to come here tonight

03:42:36,959 --> 03:42:40,879
and kick ass

but fortunately for us all wiser heads

5401
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:45,920
have prevailed

5402
03:42:46,159 --> 03:42:50,439
and we're going to keep this thing

professional

5404
03:42:52,159 --> 03:42:55,840
before i begin

5405
03:42:53,840 --> 03:42:57,199
it seems appropriate to first take a few

5406
03:42:55,840 --> 03:42:59,439
moments

5407
03:42:57,199 --> 03:43:01,920
to personally thank mr walt anders of

5408
03:42:59,439 --> 03:43:03,520
the mufon organization

5409
03:43:01,920 --> 03:43:05,279
and the organizers and hosts of this

5410
03:43:03,520 --> 03:43:07,199
symposium

5411
03:43:05,279 --> 03:43:10,079
whose kind invitation made it possible

5412
03:43:07,199 --> 03:43:10,079
for me to be here

5413
03:43:10,238 --> 03:43:13,840
i'm also appreciative of this excellent

5414
03:43:12,318 --> 03:43:15,519
time spot

5415
03:43:13,840 --> 03:43:16,880
which must mean that those who arrange

5416
03:43:15,520 --> 03:43:20,238
the schedule must think that i have

5417
03:43:16,879 --> 03:43:23,679
something to say

5418
03:43:20,238 --> 03:43:23,680
i'll try not to disappoint you

5419
03:43:24,398 --> 03:43:28,159
i might also add that my talk here

5420
03:43:26,318 --> 03:43:29,920
tonight is primarily directed at those

5421
03:43:28,159 --> 03:43:32,398
of you who are members of the ufo

5422
03:43:29,920 --> 03:43:32,398
community

5423
03:43:32,559 --> 03:43:36,238
that's not to suggest that those of you

5424
03:43:34,478 --> 03:43:38,879
who are here as third parties won't find

5425
03:43:36,238 --> 03:43:38,879
it interesting

5426
03:43:39,359 --> 03:43:43,120
it's just that you might not be able to

5427
03:43:41,120 --> 03:43:45,040
follow some of the in-house comments i'm

5428
03:43:43,120 --> 03:43:49,359
going to make

5429
03:43:45,040 --> 03:43:51,199
and that's opposed to outhouse comments

5430
03:43:49,359 --> 03:43:54,559
which i'll try to avoid even though some

5431
03:43:51,199 --> 03:43:54,560
cases they may be appropriate

5432
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:58,800
having anticipated

5433
03:43:59,439 --> 03:44:06,398
the faltering star

5434
03:44:02,799 --> 03:44:06,398
allow me to introduce myself

5435
03:44:06,959 --> 03:44:11,438
i'm aware that you already know my name

5436
03:44:09,359 --> 03:44:13,279
and i'm equally certain that many of you

5437
03:44:11,439 --> 03:44:14,079
are wondering

5438
03:44:13,279 --> 03:44:17,120
just

5439
03:44:14,079 --> 03:44:20,079
who is bill moore

5440
03:44:17,120 --> 03:44:20,079
and what's he up to

5441
03:44:20,159 --> 03:44:24,079
added to that i'm sure many other

5442
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:27,359
questions

5443
03:44:24,079 --> 03:44:29,359
is this man a government agent

5444
03:44:27,359 --> 03:44:32,640
what about his rumored contacts within

5445
03:44:29,359 --> 03:44:32,640
the intelligence community

5446
03:44:32,879 --> 03:44:37,039
are the mj-12 documents real

5447
03:44:37,199 --> 03:44:40,399
or are they counterfeit

5448
03:44:42,639 --> 03:44:48,639
and if they're counterfeit

5449
03:44:45,680 --> 03:44:48,639
did he forge them

5450
03:44:49,120 --> 03:44:52,399
and

5451
03:44:50,318 --> 03:44:54,959
isn't he really in it for the money

5452
03:44:52,398 --> 03:44:54,959
after all

5453
03:44:55,279 --> 03:45:00,720
the truth about bill moore i'm afraid is

5454
03:44:57,199 --> 03:45:00,720
considerably less sensational

5455
03:45:01,120 --> 03:45:06,000
those of you out there that know me well

5456
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:06,000
can vouch for it

5457
03:45:07,040 --> 03:45:11,960
those who don't can verify it easily

5458
03:45:08,959 --> 03:45:11,959
enough

5459
03:45:12,318 --> 03:45:19,198
graduated from college in 1965.

5460
03:45:16,079 --> 03:45:22,079
between that time in 1979 i spent 14

5461
03:45:19,199 --> 03:45:24,239
years as a high school teacher

5462
03:45:22,079 --> 03:45:25,760
and a concurrent 10 years as a part-time

5463
03:45:24,238 --> 03:45:27,439
labor relations expert within the

5464
03:45:25,760 --> 03:45:29,920
structure of the minnesota education

5465
03:45:27,439 --> 03:45:31,680
association

5466
03:45:29,920 --> 03:45:34,398
in both cases i had an excellent

5467
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:34,398
reputation

5468
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:39,840
in 1979

5469
03:45:37,920 --> 03:45:41,920
after having successfully published the

5470
03:45:39,840 --> 03:45:44,559
philadelphia experiment with co-author

5471
03:45:41,920 --> 03:45:47,359
charles burlitz

5472
03:45:44,559 --> 03:45:49,840
i resigned my teaching position

5473
03:45:47,359 --> 03:45:53,520
and moved with my family to arizona

5474
03:45:49,840 --> 03:45:55,680
in order to take up writing full time

5475
03:45:53,520 --> 03:45:57,920
in 1980

5476
03:45:55,680 --> 03:45:59,600
i co-authored a second bestseller the

5477
03:45:57,920 --> 03:46:01,199
roswell incident

5478
03:45:59,600 --> 03:46:03,439
which was the preliminary account of an

5479
03:46:01,199 --> 03:46:07,399
investigation into an alleged ufo crash

5480
03:46:03,439 --> 03:46:07,398
in new mexico in 1947.

5481
03:46:08,000 --> 03:46:11,760
at that time the book was skeptically

5482
03:46:09,760 --> 03:46:15,760
received by the ufo community and

5483
03:46:11,760 --> 03:46:15,760
mercilessly panned by the debunkers

5484
03:46:16,079 --> 03:46:20,959
i stood my ground

5485
03:46:18,639 --> 03:46:23,039
broke with berlin's

5486
03:46:20,959 --> 03:46:26,000
weathered the storm of rocks and mud

5487
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:27,840
that was thrown in my direction

5488
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:31,359
and ultimately with continued high

5489
03:46:27,840 --> 03:46:34,559
quality research and a careful skeptical

5490
03:46:31,359 --> 03:46:34,559
journalistic approach

5491
03:46:34,959 --> 03:46:38,478
managed to persuade many of the initial

5492
03:46:36,799 --> 03:46:41,039
doubters that there was indeed something

5493
03:46:38,478 --> 03:46:41,039
to the case

5494
03:46:41,520 --> 03:46:45,199
and in so doing

5495
03:46:43,439 --> 03:46:47,279
i earned the respect of many of you in

5496
03:46:45,199 --> 03:46:49,199
the audience

5497
03:46:47,279 --> 03:46:51,199
and i expect that my reputation and

5498
03:46:49,199 --> 03:46:54,000
credibility with respect to the roswell

5499
03:46:51,199 --> 03:46:55,680
case is at least partly responsible

5500
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:58,079
for my having been invited to speak here

5501
03:46:55,680 --> 03:47:01,680
tonight

5502
03:46:58,079 --> 03:47:01,680
i urge you to keep that in mind

5503
03:47:01,840 --> 03:47:05,199
if you're one of those who respects my

5504
03:47:03,439 --> 03:47:07,359
work on roswell then i ask you to

5505
03:47:05,199 --> 03:47:08,239
consider that i'm trying to carry carry

5506
03:47:07,359 --> 03:47:10,238
on

5507
03:47:08,238 --> 03:47:14,000
the same sort of quality investigation

5508
03:47:10,238 --> 03:47:14,000
with respect to my current project

5509
03:47:14,079 --> 03:47:16,840
it's just that the circumstances are

5510
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:19,040
quite

5511
03:47:16,840 --> 03:47:20,880
different i've not been in a position

5512
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:23,920
until now to properly inform others

5513
03:47:20,879 --> 03:47:23,920
about what i've been doing

5514
03:47:24,159 --> 03:47:29,199
this unfortunately has given rise to

5515
03:47:26,238 --> 03:47:31,039
considerable controversy

5516
03:47:29,199 --> 03:47:33,600
with a number of falsehoods having been

5517
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:36,239
spread by others in the ufo community

5518
03:47:33,600 --> 03:47:38,399
who saw fit to jump to hasty conclusions

5519
03:47:36,238 --> 03:47:42,000
inappropriately formed

5520
03:47:38,398 --> 03:47:42,000
without benefit of all the facts

5521
03:47:42,639 --> 03:47:47,519
one of the most persistent rumors about

5522
03:47:44,398 --> 03:47:49,119
me is that i'm a rich man

5523
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:50,880
or that i'm somehow funded by the

5524
03:47:49,120 --> 03:47:54,800
government to spread disinformation and

5525
03:47:50,879 --> 03:47:54,799
dissension within the ufo community

5526
03:47:55,120 --> 03:47:58,880
neither could be further from the truth

5527
03:47:59,040 --> 03:48:03,279
the real bill moore is as poor as a

5528
03:48:00,799 --> 03:48:05,920
church mouse

5529
03:48:03,279 --> 03:48:08,319
i came away from a divorce in 1983 with

5530
03:48:05,920 --> 03:48:10,000
virtually nothing

5531
03:48:08,318 --> 03:48:12,079
i went through bankruptcy shortly

5532
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:15,040
thereafter

5533
03:48:12,079 --> 03:48:17,439
i began to rebuild my life

5534
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:19,439
the money i make from writing royalties

5535
03:48:17,439 --> 03:48:21,199
and the sale of mostly ufo-oriented

5536
03:48:19,439 --> 03:48:23,279
books and publications

5537
03:48:21,199 --> 03:48:25,760
is all plowed back into living expenses

5538
03:48:23,279 --> 03:48:27,840
and continuing research

5539
03:48:25,760 --> 03:48:30,960
it's a constant scrape to get by but i

5540
03:48:27,840 --> 03:48:30,960
believe in what i'm doing

5541
03:48:31,040 --> 03:48:35,520
and in order to preserve the freedom

5542
03:48:32,559 --> 03:48:38,079
necessary to continue

5543
03:48:35,520 --> 03:48:40,560
i've had to make sacrifices

5544
03:48:38,079 --> 03:48:42,559
i'm definitely not in this business for

5545
03:48:40,559 --> 03:48:45,439
the money

5546
03:48:42,559 --> 03:48:51,519
i live in a rented house

5547
03:48:45,439 --> 03:48:54,000
i drive a 1977 car and a 1979 motorcycle

5548
03:48:51,520 --> 03:48:55,359
i have no savings accounts

5549
03:48:54,000 --> 03:48:57,040
no stops

5550
03:48:55,359 --> 03:48:58,640
no bonds

5551
03:48:57,040 --> 03:49:00,080
and i recently dropped my health

5552
03:48:58,639 --> 03:49:01,840
insurance because i couldn't afford it

5553
03:49:00,079 --> 03:49:04,559
any longer

5554
03:49:01,840 --> 03:49:07,439
i'm not looking for a handout

5555
03:49:04,559 --> 03:49:09,519
nor do i expect any sympathy

5556
03:49:07,439 --> 03:49:12,079
i simply tell you this

5557
03:49:09,520 --> 03:49:13,840
because i want it on the record

5558
03:49:12,079 --> 03:49:15,520
those who are spreading rumors that i

5559
03:49:13,840 --> 03:49:18,559
live in wealth and comfort are invited

5560
03:49:15,520 --> 03:49:21,359
to come and verify the situation any

5561
03:49:18,559 --> 03:49:24,398
time they wish

5562
03:49:21,359 --> 03:49:25,760
my door is open

5563
03:49:24,398 --> 03:49:28,079
those who allege that i have

5564
03:49:25,760 --> 03:49:31,439
counterfeited documents

5565
03:49:28,079 --> 03:49:33,279
and concocted a hoax on the mj-12 matter

5566
03:49:31,439 --> 03:49:35,439
had better take the same facts into

5567
03:49:33,279 --> 03:49:37,439
account

5568
03:49:35,439 --> 03:49:40,559
rest assured

5569
03:49:37,439 --> 03:49:44,000
i know myself well enough

5570
03:49:40,559 --> 03:49:45,680
if i was trying to perpetrate a hoax

5571
03:49:44,000 --> 03:49:48,478
i would have played it for all the cash

5572
03:49:45,680 --> 03:49:51,439
i could get a long time ago

5573
03:49:48,478 --> 03:49:53,039
and taken the money and run

5574
03:49:51,439 --> 03:49:57,120
as some are doing

5575
03:49:53,040 --> 03:49:59,199
even now in the ufo community

5576
03:49:57,120 --> 03:50:00,800
and as for my being on the government's

5577
03:49:59,199 --> 03:50:04,000
payroll

5578
03:50:00,799 --> 03:50:06,879
i can only say that i wish i was

5579
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:10,559
the government pays well

5580
03:50:06,879 --> 03:50:10,559
and it provides excellent benefits

5581
03:50:11,279 --> 03:50:15,840
so why should you believe anything bill

5582
03:50:12,959 --> 03:50:17,599
moore has to say

5583
03:50:15,840 --> 03:50:19,439
the fact is that i have information that

5584
03:50:17,600 --> 03:50:21,600
will add to your knowledge of the ufo

5585
03:50:19,439 --> 03:50:24,000
phenomenon

5586
03:50:21,600 --> 03:50:25,600
i will report it to you in as a reliable

5587
03:50:24,000 --> 03:50:30,238
fashion as i can

5588
03:50:25,600 --> 03:50:31,760
and in as objective a manner as possible

5589
03:50:30,238 --> 03:50:33,520
those of you who have numbered among my

5590
03:50:31,760 --> 03:50:34,960
friends and supporters will perhaps find

5591
03:50:33,520 --> 03:50:36,720
it comforting

5592
03:50:34,959 --> 03:50:38,000
in light of some of the more outrageous

5593
03:50:36,719 --> 03:50:41,840
rumors that have been circulating

5594
03:50:38,000 --> 03:50:41,840
throughout the ufo community recently

5595
03:50:42,000 --> 03:50:45,520
others of you who have

5596
03:50:43,680 --> 03:50:47,600
who have chosen to cast aspersions and

5597
03:50:45,520 --> 03:50:49,600
throw rocks in my directions out of fear

5598
03:50:47,600 --> 03:50:52,399
that i might uncover something which

5599
03:50:49,600 --> 03:50:54,559
will upstage your own efforts

5600
03:50:52,398 --> 03:50:56,639
will undoubtedly take great great pains

5601
03:50:54,559 --> 03:50:58,398
to dissect what i have to say here

5602
03:50:56,639 --> 03:51:00,799
in an effort to find more reasons to

5603
03:50:58,398 --> 03:51:02,959
question my integrity

5604
03:51:00,799 --> 03:51:05,358
no matter

5605
03:51:02,959 --> 03:51:07,278
in the final analysis i'm not asking you

5606
03:51:05,359 --> 03:51:09,439
to believe

5607
03:51:07,279 --> 03:51:11,520
only to listen

5608
03:51:09,439 --> 03:51:14,000
what you do from that point is entirely

5609
03:51:11,520 --> 03:51:14,000
up to you

5610
03:51:14,478 --> 03:51:18,079
two years ago at the mufon symposium in

5611
03:51:16,478 --> 03:51:19,840
washington dc

5612
03:51:18,079 --> 03:51:22,079
i stood before a similar audience and

5613
03:51:19,840 --> 03:51:25,840
presented preliminary information on the

5614
03:51:22,079 --> 03:51:25,840
so-called mj12 papers

5615
03:51:26,159 --> 03:51:30,799
i also alluded at that time

5616
03:51:28,478 --> 03:51:32,478
to a series of ongoing contacts between

5617
03:51:30,799 --> 03:51:34,000
myself and a number of well-placed

5618
03:51:32,478 --> 03:51:37,198
individuals within the government and

5619
03:51:34,000 --> 03:51:37,199
the intelligence community

5620
03:51:37,279 --> 03:51:42,800
american ufology has been in a turmoil

5621
03:51:39,520 --> 03:51:45,600
over the mj-12 matter ever since

5622
03:51:42,799 --> 03:51:47,519
with charges and counter charges being

5623
03:51:45,600 --> 03:51:51,120
thrown back and forth so fast that it's

5624
03:51:47,520 --> 03:51:52,560
almost impossible to keep up with them

5625
03:51:51,120 --> 03:51:54,640
worse

5626
03:51:52,559 --> 03:51:56,840
the rumor mill

5627
03:51:54,639 --> 03:51:59,278
fueled by speculation

5628
03:51:56,840 --> 03:52:01,120
disinformation and increasingly gross

5629
03:51:59,279 --> 03:52:03,600
exaggerations on the part of those who

5630
03:52:01,120 --> 03:52:05,760
ought to know better

5631
03:52:03,600 --> 03:52:08,640
has emerged as a major force which it

5632
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:10,639
sometimes seems from this vantage point

5633
03:52:08,639 --> 03:52:13,599
has all but replaced common sense and

5634
03:52:10,639 --> 03:52:15,119
sought judgment in some circles

5635
03:52:13,600 --> 03:52:16,880
what ought to have been a sane and

5636
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:18,640
concerted effort to get it the truth is

5637
03:52:16,879 --> 03:52:21,679
taken on virtually all the trappings of

5638
03:52:18,639 --> 03:52:21,680
a three-ring circus

5639
03:52:21,840 --> 03:52:25,920
and american ufology as i see it now

5640
03:52:24,238 --> 03:52:28,238
stands at the edge of a severe crisis

5641
03:52:25,920 --> 03:52:31,040
which has already shaken it

5642
03:52:28,238 --> 03:52:33,039
to its very core

5643
03:52:31,040 --> 03:52:35,279
i have every confidence that ufology

5644
03:52:33,040 --> 03:52:36,960
will survive

5645
03:52:35,279 --> 03:52:38,800
whether it will emerge from this present

5646
03:52:36,959 --> 03:52:40,799
state of flux with its much as much

5647
03:52:38,799 --> 03:52:42,959
credibility as it had going in i don't

5648
03:52:40,799 --> 03:52:42,959
know

5649
03:52:43,520 --> 03:52:47,120
i for one

5650
03:52:45,359 --> 03:52:48,960
am somewhat ashamed

5651
03:52:47,120 --> 03:52:51,199
and embarrassed

5652
03:52:48,959 --> 03:52:54,318
by the mudslinging that i have witnessed

5653
03:52:51,199 --> 03:52:56,960
much of it directed at me

5654
03:52:54,318 --> 03:52:59,198
these past two years

5655
03:52:56,959 --> 03:53:01,679
and by the incessant and increasing

5656
03:52:59,199 --> 03:53:04,640
rumor mongering which has tantalized us

5657
03:53:01,680 --> 03:53:06,398
all by its highly sensational nature

5658
03:53:04,639 --> 03:53:08,000
and yet in the final analysis has

5659
03:53:06,398 --> 03:53:10,639
offered us so very little in the way of

5660
03:53:08,000 --> 03:53:12,559
tangible evidence

5661
03:53:10,639 --> 03:53:14,238
i hope what i have to say here tonight

5662
03:53:12,559 --> 03:53:16,799
will have the positive effect of laying

5663
03:53:14,238 --> 03:53:19,039
some of it to rest

5664
03:53:16,799 --> 03:53:22,879
but speaking in all kandor

5665
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:24,720
i certainly won't count on it

5666
03:53:22,879 --> 03:53:27,358
throughout our history mankind has

5667
03:53:24,719 --> 03:53:29,760
witnessed many quests

5668
03:53:27,359 --> 03:53:31,520
and in every case

5669
03:53:29,760 --> 03:53:33,279
those who study history tell us that

5670
03:53:31,520 --> 03:53:34,840
there was the inevitable clack of

5671
03:53:33,279 --> 03:53:37,680
narrow-minded

5672
03:53:34,840 --> 03:53:39,600
fools who believing that such quests

5673
03:53:37,680 --> 03:53:41,439
waste time and energy better spent on

5674
03:53:39,600 --> 03:53:43,439
useful endeavors

5675
03:53:41,439 --> 03:53:44,800
did everything they could to discourage

5676
03:53:43,439 --> 03:53:48,000
the process and discredit the

5677
03:53:44,799 --> 03:53:48,000
individuals involved

5678
03:53:48,079 --> 03:53:52,719
pardon my observations but so it is with

5679
03:53:50,959 --> 03:53:55,039
our present quest for knowledge about

5680
03:53:52,719 --> 03:53:57,358
ufos

5681
03:53:55,040 --> 03:53:59,359
whether ufos are or are not

5682
03:53:57,359 --> 03:54:01,279
extraterrestrial is really only a part

5683
03:53:59,359 --> 03:54:03,199
of the picture

5684
03:54:01,279 --> 03:54:05,199
in the final analysis

5685
03:54:03,199 --> 03:54:07,920
the process of studying this phenomenon

5686
03:54:05,199 --> 03:54:09,840
and the people involved with it

5687
03:54:07,920 --> 03:54:12,318
of assessing the claims and the counter

5688
03:54:09,840 --> 03:54:12,318
claims

5689
03:54:12,559 --> 03:54:15,920
and of dealing with the question of how

5690
03:54:14,159 --> 03:54:17,840
we as earthlings will react to the

5691
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:21,359
discovery of a race of extraterrestrial

5692
03:54:17,840 --> 03:54:23,040
visitors and how they will react to us

5693
03:54:21,359 --> 03:54:25,040
all of this and more when finally looked

5694
03:54:23,040 --> 03:54:26,960
at in perspective

5695
03:54:25,040 --> 03:54:29,760
leads us to the inescapable recognition

5696
03:54:26,959 --> 03:54:31,599
that in studying the ufo phenomenon

5697
03:54:29,760 --> 03:54:35,279
we are at the same time becoming more

5698
03:54:31,600 --> 03:54:37,199
aware of ourselves as individuals

5699
03:54:35,279 --> 03:54:40,319
and learning something about the society

5700
03:54:37,199 --> 03:54:40,319
that we are a part of

5701
03:54:41,199 --> 03:54:45,199
the recognition as noted by my friend

5702
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:47,040
stan friedman

5703
03:54:45,199 --> 03:54:49,520
many years ago

5704
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:51,199
that any alien spending 10 minutes

5705
03:54:49,520 --> 03:54:52,880
looking at planet earth

5706
03:54:51,199 --> 03:54:55,359
must come away with the conclusion that

5707
03:54:52,879 --> 03:54:57,198
we are in the eyes of that alien

5708
03:54:55,359 --> 03:55:00,880
nothing more than a primitive society

5709
03:54:57,199 --> 03:55:02,960
whose major activity is tribal warfare

5710
03:55:00,879 --> 03:55:05,119
is it once both revealing

5711
03:55:02,959 --> 03:55:07,438
and powerful

5712
03:55:05,120 --> 03:55:09,359
it is through the mirror of ufos as

5713
03:55:07,439 --> 03:55:11,520
alien visitors that we ultimately come

5714
03:55:09,359 --> 03:55:13,920
to look at ourselves

5715
03:55:11,520 --> 03:55:16,079
and to recognize what and who we really

5716
03:55:13,920 --> 03:55:16,079
are

5717
03:55:16,398 --> 03:55:21,680
such a process can only prove beneficial

5718
03:55:18,799 --> 03:55:23,679
to mankind in the long term regardless

5719
03:55:21,680 --> 03:55:25,920
of what the true nature of ufos turns

5720
03:55:23,680 --> 03:55:28,398
out to be and those who would stand in

5721
03:55:25,920 --> 03:55:30,879
its way by attempting to keep derision

5722
03:55:28,398 --> 03:55:34,318
or ridicule upon the subject do us a

5723
03:55:30,879 --> 03:55:34,318
grave disservice

5724
03:55:34,478 --> 03:55:40,639
had mankind's greatest inventors

5725
03:55:37,359 --> 03:55:44,079
scientists explorers builders painters

5726
03:55:40,639 --> 03:55:45,840
musicians composers physicians surgeons

5727
03:55:44,079 --> 03:55:47,120
the list goes on

5728
03:55:45,840 --> 03:55:49,439
the point is

5729
03:55:47,120 --> 03:55:51,439
had these people throughout our history

5730
03:55:49,439 --> 03:55:53,359
heeded the mindless blusterings and

5731
03:55:51,439 --> 03:55:55,680
ravings of the skeptics the scoffers and

5732
03:55:53,359 --> 03:55:57,920
the debunkers who were present in each

5733
03:55:55,680 --> 03:56:00,159
and every case

5734
03:55:57,920 --> 03:56:02,318
there would have been no progress

5735
03:56:00,159 --> 03:56:04,159
and mankind would still be in the stone

5736
03:56:02,318 --> 03:56:05,519
age

5737
03:56:04,159 --> 03:56:07,359
moreover

5738
03:56:05,520 --> 03:56:10,560
in every case where a breakthrough was

5739
03:56:07,359 --> 03:56:12,640
achieved and progress was made it is the

5740
03:56:10,559 --> 03:56:14,879
achiever who is remembered and honored

5741
03:56:12,639 --> 03:56:19,398
by history and not the debunker and the

5742
03:56:14,879 --> 03:56:19,398
skeptic who said it could not be done

5743
03:56:26,559 --> 03:56:30,639
the bottom line here is that the ufo

5744
03:56:28,398 --> 03:56:33,119
phenomenon is

5745
03:56:30,639 --> 03:56:35,519
a legitimate study

5746
03:56:33,120 --> 03:56:38,560
by anyone in our free society who

5747
03:56:35,520 --> 03:56:39,840
chooses to do so

5748
03:56:38,559 --> 03:56:41,519
and those who have elected to

5749
03:56:39,840 --> 03:56:43,199
participate in such a quest should not

5750
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:45,680
be held up to derision and ridicule

5751
03:56:43,199 --> 03:56:48,960
because of it

5752
03:56:45,680 --> 03:56:50,880
those debunkers and ufo bashers

5753
03:56:48,959 --> 03:56:52,959
who have nothing positive to contribute

5754
03:56:50,879 --> 03:56:55,759
are advised to go and massage their egos

5755
03:56:52,959 --> 03:56:55,759
somewhere else

5756
03:57:01,840 --> 03:57:06,159
in my opinion those people have no right

5757
03:57:04,159 --> 03:57:08,318
whatsoever

5758
03:57:06,159 --> 03:57:10,478
to dictate to others what is fit for

5759
03:57:08,318 --> 03:57:12,879
study and what is not

5760
03:57:10,478 --> 03:57:15,760
or what people should believe

5761
03:57:12,879 --> 03:57:15,759
and what they shouldn't

5762
03:57:16,079 --> 03:57:19,520
which brings me to my next point

5763
03:57:19,600 --> 03:57:23,600
i've been accumulating information on

5764
03:57:21,279 --> 03:57:25,920
the ufo phenomenon for more than 25

5765
03:57:23,600 --> 03:57:25,920
years

5766
03:57:26,318 --> 03:57:32,398
during that time

5767
03:57:28,398 --> 03:57:34,238
i have watched ufology trying to grow up

5768
03:57:32,398 --> 03:57:35,760
trying to achieve respectability with

5769
03:57:34,238 --> 03:57:38,639
the public the news media and the

5770
03:57:35,760 --> 03:57:40,880
scientific community

5771
03:57:38,639 --> 03:57:42,559
in that process i am sorry to say it's

5772
03:57:40,879 --> 03:57:46,079
been my observation

5773
03:57:42,559 --> 03:57:46,840
that we have been our own worst enemy

5774
03:57:46,079 --> 03:57:49,760
no

5775
03:57:46,840 --> 03:57:51,760
skeptic no debunker

5776
03:57:49,760 --> 03:57:53,760
could possibly do that we have done to

5777
03:57:51,760 --> 03:57:57,920
ourselves not once

5778
03:57:53,760 --> 03:58:00,800
but time and time again

5779
03:57:57,920 --> 03:58:02,159
we say we want respectability

5780
03:58:00,799 --> 03:58:04,159
yet we have made little effort to

5781
03:58:02,159 --> 03:58:06,238
construct the foundations necessary to

5782
03:58:04,159 --> 03:58:07,359
achieve it

5783
03:58:06,238 --> 03:58:10,000
sadly

5784
03:58:07,359 --> 03:58:11,920
we have no uniform standards

5785
03:58:10,000 --> 03:58:13,199
no professional ethics

5786
03:58:11,920 --> 03:58:16,639
no peers

5787
03:58:13,199 --> 03:58:19,439
no qualifications no uniform goals and

5788
03:58:16,639 --> 03:58:22,559
few credible spokespersons

5789
03:58:19,439 --> 03:58:25,199
nobody speaks for ufology

5790
03:58:22,559 --> 03:58:28,000
or rather perhaps more correctly

5791
03:58:25,199 --> 03:58:30,000
everybody speaks for ufology all at the

5792
03:58:28,000 --> 03:58:32,000
same time and each with a different

5793
03:58:30,000 --> 03:58:34,639
voice

5794
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:36,318
anybody can be a ufologist

5795
03:58:34,639 --> 03:58:37,680
all they need to do is tack the title at

5796
03:58:36,318 --> 03:58:39,519
the end of their name

5797
03:58:37,680 --> 03:58:42,079
and publish

5798
03:58:39,520 --> 03:58:43,600
yes even self-publish

5799
03:58:42,079 --> 03:58:45,680
a book

5800
03:58:43,600 --> 03:58:48,159
start a newsletter

5801
03:58:45,680 --> 03:58:50,199
or get themselves on television

5802
03:58:48,159 --> 03:58:53,199
and should their material be pure

5803
03:58:50,199 --> 03:58:54,800
unsubstantiated clap trap or broken

5804
03:58:53,199 --> 03:58:56,640
crockery

5805
03:58:54,799 --> 03:58:59,679
that's cracked pottery for those of you

5806
03:58:56,639 --> 03:59:01,439
that don't get that one no matter

5807
03:58:59,680 --> 03:59:03,439
there's always some other self-styled

5808
03:59:01,439 --> 03:59:04,960
ufologist who will come along

5809
03:59:03,439 --> 03:59:06,318
see it as the ultimate wisdom of the

5810
03:59:04,959 --> 03:59:07,839
universe

5811
03:59:06,318 --> 03:59:11,119
and endorse it wholeheartedly thus

5812
03:59:07,840 --> 03:59:11,120
adding further to the confusion

5813
03:59:11,520 --> 03:59:15,040
is it any wonder

5814
03:59:13,199 --> 03:59:16,560
we have degenerated into a host of

5815
03:59:15,040 --> 03:59:18,239
political camps

5816
03:59:16,559 --> 03:59:20,318
each one of which throws rocks at as

5817
03:59:18,238 --> 03:59:22,318
many of the others as possible while at

5818
03:59:20,318 --> 03:59:23,920
the same time loudly proclaiming to all

5819
03:59:22,318 --> 03:59:26,559
who will listen that they are the only

5820
03:59:23,920 --> 03:59:28,079
true religion

5821
03:59:26,559 --> 03:59:30,799
meanwhile the debunkers who are

5822
03:59:28,079 --> 03:59:32,639
essentially united under a single banner

5823
03:59:30,799 --> 03:59:34,959
throw rocks at all of us

5824
03:59:32,639 --> 03:59:36,959
and the public as hapless observer the

5825
03:59:34,959 --> 03:59:38,839
entire process emerges more confused

5826
03:59:36,959 --> 03:59:42,318
than

5827
03:59:38,840 --> 03:59:44,318
ever with that in mind

5828
03:59:42,318 --> 03:59:47,680
i would like to take a moment and ask

5829
03:59:44,318 --> 03:59:51,600
each and every member of this audience

5830
03:59:47,680 --> 03:59:53,680
to reach down inside yourself

5831
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:57,120
and come up with a true answer to a very

5832
03:59:53,680 --> 03:59:58,960
important and difficult question

5833
03:59:57,120 --> 04:00:01,040
what you say publicly has no meaning in

5834
03:59:58,959 --> 04:00:02,478
this process

5835
04:00:01,040 --> 04:00:04,319
it's what you know

5836
04:00:02,478 --> 04:00:06,719
inside of yourself to be truth that

5837
04:00:04,318 --> 04:00:06,719
matters

5838
04:00:06,799 --> 04:00:11,599
i want you to ask yourself

5839
04:00:09,760 --> 04:00:12,880
why are you

5840
04:00:11,600 --> 04:00:16,399
involved

5841
04:00:12,879 --> 04:00:16,398
with the ufo phenomenon

5842
04:00:16,799 --> 04:00:21,920
do you truly desire answers

5843
04:00:19,920 --> 04:00:23,760
no matter what those answers may be and

5844
04:00:21,920 --> 04:00:25,199
no matter how much those answers may be

5845
04:00:23,760 --> 04:00:27,600
at variance with what you presently

5846
04:00:25,199 --> 04:00:27,600
believe

5847
04:00:28,799 --> 04:00:34,079
or are you one of those people who

5848
04:00:30,719 --> 04:00:35,920
thrives on a continuing mystery

5849
04:00:34,079 --> 04:00:38,079
whose very position in the field of

5850
04:00:35,920 --> 04:00:41,680
ufology requires that the mystery of

5851
04:00:38,079 --> 04:00:43,760
ufos be perpetuated rather than solved

5852
04:00:41,680 --> 04:00:47,680
so that you can continue

5853
04:00:43,760 --> 04:00:47,680
in your self-styled role of importance

5854
04:00:47,760 --> 04:00:50,719
let's suppose you are the head of an

5855
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:52,479
organization devoted to the study of

5856
04:00:50,719 --> 04:00:53,840
ufos

5857
04:00:52,478 --> 04:00:56,318
and there are several such here

5858
04:00:53,840 --> 04:00:58,079
including myself

5859
04:00:56,318 --> 04:01:00,559
what happens to your organization and

5860
04:00:58,079 --> 04:01:04,398
ultimately to you yourself

5861
04:01:00,559 --> 04:01:08,079
if the ufo mystery is suddenly solved

5862
04:01:04,398 --> 04:01:09,198
do you truly want to see that happen

5863
04:01:08,079 --> 04:01:11,199
or is it more

5864
04:01:09,199 --> 04:01:14,079
palatable and convenient to keep the pot

5865
04:01:11,199 --> 04:01:16,720
simmering for as long as possible

5866
04:01:14,079 --> 04:01:20,238
only you and you alone

5867
04:01:16,719 --> 04:01:21,840
know what it is that motivates you

5868
04:01:20,238 --> 04:01:23,920
if you're one who's sincerely interested

5869
04:01:21,840 --> 04:01:27,840
in finding answers

5870
04:01:23,920 --> 04:01:29,199
and if you can proceed with an open mind

5871
04:01:27,840 --> 04:01:31,600
and maybe i can offer you some

5872
04:01:29,199 --> 04:01:34,000
inspiration

5873
04:01:31,600 --> 04:01:35,920
if on the other hand

5874
04:01:34,000 --> 04:01:37,359
you are one who prefers to inflate your

5875
04:01:35,920 --> 04:01:39,439
own image through the spreading of

5876
04:01:37,359 --> 04:01:40,600
unsubstantiated often alarming and

5877
04:01:39,439 --> 04:01:43,359
increasingly

5878
04:01:40,600 --> 04:01:45,120
sensationalistic disinformation hearsay

5879
04:01:43,359 --> 04:01:46,640
and rumor

5880
04:01:45,120 --> 04:01:48,399
then i urge you to reassess your

5881
04:01:46,639 --> 04:01:51,278
position and channel your energies along

5882
04:01:48,398 --> 04:01:53,760
more acceptable lines

5883
04:01:51,279 --> 04:01:55,840
if you haven't thought about that

5884
04:01:53,760 --> 04:01:57,359
i urge you to do so

5885
04:01:55,840 --> 04:02:01,279
it's important

5886
04:01:57,359 --> 04:02:03,680
that we all know where we stand

5887
04:02:01,279 --> 04:02:06,159
as for myself

5888
04:02:03,680 --> 04:02:07,920
i made my decision a number of years ago

5889
04:02:06,159 --> 04:02:09,039
as a result of suddenly having found

5890
04:02:07,920 --> 04:02:10,719
myself

5891
04:02:09,040 --> 04:02:12,560
face to face

5892
04:02:10,719 --> 04:02:16,079
with an opportunity to learn more about

5893
04:02:12,559 --> 04:02:18,079
what our government knows about ufos

5894
04:02:16,079 --> 04:02:21,039
i believe then

5895
04:02:18,079 --> 04:02:23,120
and i continue to believe now

5896
04:02:21,040 --> 04:02:25,040
that it is possible to uncover answers

5897
04:02:23,120 --> 04:02:26,840
by searching carefully and competently

5898
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:28,399
for them in the right

5899
04:02:26,840 --> 04:02:30,559
places

5900
04:02:28,398 --> 04:02:33,198
finding those answers and thus ending my

5901
04:02:30,559 --> 04:02:35,840
so-called career as a ufologist poses no

5902
04:02:33,199 --> 04:02:37,760
problems at all for me

5903
04:02:35,840 --> 04:02:39,199
as a writer i'm interested in a variety

5904
04:02:37,760 --> 04:02:42,719
of subjects

5905
04:02:39,199 --> 04:02:44,640
many of them non-ufo related

5906
04:02:42,719 --> 04:02:46,478
should i go as far as i feel i can with

5907
04:02:44,639 --> 04:02:48,639
a ufo question i have plenty of other

5908
04:02:46,478 --> 04:02:50,159
fish to fry

5909
04:02:48,639 --> 04:02:53,358
many of which are just as interesting

5910
04:02:50,159 --> 04:02:53,359
and every bit is challenging

5911
04:02:53,600 --> 04:02:58,000
the truth

5912
04:02:55,279 --> 04:03:00,238
fellow ufologists

5913
04:02:58,000 --> 04:03:03,520
is that i have known precisely what i

5914
04:03:00,238 --> 04:03:05,279
was doing all along

5915
04:03:03,520 --> 04:03:07,439
it's just that very few other people

5916
04:03:05,279 --> 04:03:09,199
knew what i was doing

5917
04:03:07,439 --> 04:03:11,279
and it was this lack of information on

5918
04:03:09,199 --> 04:03:15,040
the part of other researchers that has

5919
04:03:11,279 --> 04:03:17,359
given rise to so much controversy

5920
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:19,040
consequently i harbor no grudge against

5921
04:03:17,359 --> 04:03:20,880
others who have attacked me sometimes

5922
04:03:19,040 --> 04:03:22,000
bitterly because they disagreed with my

5923
04:03:20,879 --> 04:03:24,238
methods

5924
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:26,238
or because they mistook my refusal to

5925
04:03:24,238 --> 04:03:30,159
answer their often legitimate questions

5926
04:03:26,238 --> 04:03:33,119
as a display of arrogance and contempt

5927
04:03:30,159 --> 04:03:35,840
i counseled patience then

5928
04:03:33,120 --> 04:03:38,000
and i counsel it now

5929
04:03:35,840 --> 04:03:40,238
a rush to judgment is a dangerous and a

5930
04:03:38,000 --> 04:03:42,318
divisive thing

5931
04:03:40,238 --> 04:03:44,159
those who engage in such practices may

5932
04:03:42,318 --> 04:03:47,119
sound high-minded

5933
04:03:44,159 --> 04:03:48,639
and well-informed at first blush

5934
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:50,160
but in the long run

5935
04:03:48,639 --> 04:03:52,559
they do nothing to enhance their own

5936
04:03:50,159 --> 04:03:54,318
stature or credibility and they

5937
04:03:52,559 --> 04:03:57,198
certainly contribute nothing to our

5938
04:03:54,318 --> 04:03:57,198
quest for answers

5939
04:03:57,359 --> 04:04:02,640
consider the strange case of mr smith

5940
04:04:00,719 --> 04:04:05,959
mr jones

5941
04:04:02,639 --> 04:04:05,959
and the jury

5942
04:04:06,159 --> 04:04:11,760
the audience or the jury

5943
04:04:09,120 --> 04:04:15,600
mr smith is dead

5944
04:04:11,760 --> 04:04:17,600
mr jones is being tried for the murder

5945
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:20,800
the prosecutor stands before you and

5946
04:04:17,600 --> 04:04:22,720
gives you these facts

5947
04:04:20,799 --> 04:04:24,478
when the police arrived in response to a

5948
04:04:22,719 --> 04:04:26,079
complaint that a fight was in progress

5949
04:04:24,478 --> 04:04:28,000
he says

5950
04:04:26,079 --> 04:04:30,559
mr smith was found lying dead on the

5951
04:04:28,000 --> 04:04:33,439
floor of his apartment

5952
04:04:30,559 --> 04:04:36,719
the cause of death was strangulation

5953
04:04:33,439 --> 04:04:38,960
and the body was still warm

5954
04:04:36,719 --> 04:04:40,879
mr jones was found bending over the body

5955
04:04:38,959 --> 04:04:43,119
with his hands still around the victim's

5956
04:04:40,879 --> 04:04:45,198
throat

5957
04:04:43,120 --> 04:04:46,800
neighbors and others who knew both men

5958
04:04:45,199 --> 04:04:48,720
have testified that there was

5959
04:04:46,799 --> 04:04:50,719
considerable animosity between the two

5960
04:04:48,719 --> 04:04:52,398
of them

5961
04:04:50,719 --> 04:04:54,238
and that on more than one occasion mr

5962
04:04:52,398 --> 04:04:57,198
jones was heard to threaten mr smith's

5963
04:04:54,238 --> 04:04:59,760
safety and well-being

5964
04:04:57,199 --> 04:05:01,520
obviously jones had gone to c smith and

5965
04:04:59,760 --> 04:05:04,159
a violent argument ensued during which

5966
04:05:01,520 --> 04:05:06,560
jones strangled smith

5967
04:05:04,159 --> 04:05:08,398
unfortunately for jones the police

5968
04:05:06,559 --> 04:05:11,359
arrived before he was able to affect and

5969
04:05:08,398 --> 04:05:11,358
escape from the scene

5970
04:05:11,520 --> 04:05:15,600
hear the jury

5971
04:05:13,760 --> 04:05:18,318
is this sufficient evidence to condemn

5972
04:05:15,600 --> 04:05:20,000
mr jones for murder

5973
04:05:18,318 --> 04:05:21,680
i tried out this scenario during

5974
04:05:20,000 --> 04:05:23,920
conversations with a number of people

5975
04:05:21,680 --> 04:05:25,840
over the past few months

5976
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:28,559
and i was amazed at how many people

5977
04:05:25,840 --> 04:05:30,318
agreed that it is

5978
04:05:28,559 --> 04:05:32,000
one of whom was my good friend walt

5979
04:05:30,318 --> 04:05:33,840
anders

5980
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:36,000
who recently saw fit to publish an

5981
04:05:33,840 --> 04:05:37,680
outrageously lopsided piece of trash in

5982
04:05:36,000 --> 04:05:39,840
his newsletter

5983
04:05:37,680 --> 04:05:42,559
written by a man i've never met

5984
04:05:39,840 --> 04:05:44,318
spoken to or corresponded with and who

5985
04:05:42,559 --> 04:05:45,840
could have easily obtained answers to

5986
04:05:44,318 --> 04:05:48,639
his questions simply by taking the

5987
04:05:45,840 --> 04:05:48,639
trouble to ask

5988
04:05:48,959 --> 04:05:52,639
a significant minority who listened to

5989
04:05:50,799 --> 04:05:56,159
my smith and jones scenario however

5990
04:05:52,639 --> 04:05:59,198
hesitated before passing judgment

5991
04:05:56,159 --> 04:06:02,079
what is mr jones's defense

5992
04:05:59,199 --> 04:06:02,079
they wanted to know

5993
04:06:03,520 --> 04:06:07,040
and of course that's really what it's

5994
04:06:04,959 --> 04:06:08,959
all about

5995
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:11,040
in the case of smith and jones the truth

5996
04:06:08,959 --> 04:06:13,039
is that it was smith who invited jones

5997
04:06:11,040 --> 04:06:15,600
to his apartment with the intention of

5998
04:06:13,040 --> 04:06:17,680
quietly doing him in

5999
04:06:15,600 --> 04:06:19,920
and disposing of the body before anyone

6000
04:06:17,680 --> 04:06:22,559
was the wiser

6001
04:06:19,920 --> 04:06:24,079
jones however turned the tables on smith

6002
04:06:22,559 --> 04:06:27,439
and accidentally killed him in the

6003
04:06:24,079 --> 04:06:29,279
process of self-defense

6004
04:06:27,439 --> 04:06:32,238
and so it is in the case of more the

6005
04:06:29,279 --> 04:06:33,920
government and mj-12

6006
04:06:32,238 --> 04:06:35,198
those who have already decided that i'm

6007
04:06:33,920 --> 04:06:37,840
one of the bad guys in this

6008
04:06:35,199 --> 04:06:41,680
controversial case have done so on the

6009
04:06:37,840 --> 04:06:43,279
basis of only half a story

6010
04:06:41,680 --> 04:06:45,920
they have rushed to judgment without

6011
04:06:43,279 --> 04:06:47,680
hearing the defense

6012
04:06:45,920 --> 04:06:51,199
indeed

6013
04:06:47,680 --> 04:06:54,079
some of the most vocal of my critics

6014
04:06:51,199 --> 04:06:57,439
have never once bothered to contact me

6015
04:06:54,079 --> 04:07:00,079
and ask me if i had a defense

6016
04:06:57,439 --> 04:07:02,398
hasty pudding as one recent track put it

6017
04:07:00,079 --> 04:07:06,559
quite humorously

6018
04:07:02,398 --> 04:07:06,559
a tract which by the way i did not write

6019
04:07:06,879 --> 04:07:10,799
but which i found to be most appropriate

6020
04:07:11,040 --> 04:07:15,040
unfortunately i can't provide you with

6021
04:07:12,719 --> 04:07:16,639
the entire case for the defense this

6022
04:07:15,040 --> 04:07:18,239
evening

6023
04:07:16,639 --> 04:07:21,358
the reason is the defense is still in

6024
04:07:18,238 --> 04:07:23,520
process of completing its investigation

6025
04:07:21,359 --> 04:07:25,439
but i can provide you with a significant

6026
04:07:23,520 --> 04:07:27,520
part of it

6027
04:07:25,439 --> 04:07:29,520
enough so that at least you can begin to

6028
04:07:27,520 --> 04:07:32,640
understand what i've been doing

6029
04:07:29,520 --> 04:07:32,640
and where it's all going

6030
04:07:33,040 --> 04:07:37,920
for some of you

6031
04:07:34,719 --> 04:07:40,478
it may not be what you want to hear

6032
04:07:37,920 --> 04:07:41,680
but it's nonetheless true

6033
04:07:40,478 --> 04:07:43,599
and it should provide you with a good

6034
04:07:41,680 --> 04:07:45,760
sense of perspective concerning a lot of

6035
04:07:43,600 --> 04:07:49,199
other things that have been going on in

6036
04:07:45,760 --> 04:07:51,199
ufological circles recently

6037
04:07:49,199 --> 04:07:54,720
it all began more than 10 years ago with

6038
04:07:51,199 --> 04:07:54,720
a man named paul benowitz

6039
04:07:55,359 --> 04:07:59,279
let me preface my remarks by offering

6040
04:07:57,600 --> 04:08:01,199
the sincere and candid statement that

6041
04:07:59,279 --> 04:08:02,960
what i'm going to say

6042
04:08:01,199 --> 04:08:04,880
is to the best of my knowledge entirely

6043
04:08:02,959 --> 04:08:06,398
true

6044
04:08:04,879 --> 04:08:08,318
it is offered without malice or

6045
04:08:06,398 --> 04:08:09,680
prejudice in any way

6046
04:08:08,318 --> 04:08:11,760
it is under no

6047
04:08:09,680 --> 04:08:13,680
circumstances intended to be libelous or

6048
04:08:11,760 --> 04:08:16,559
defamatory

6049
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:18,238
i genuinely like mr benowitz

6050
04:08:16,559 --> 04:08:19,760
continue to regard him as a friend and

6051
04:08:18,238 --> 04:08:22,398
have a great deal of sympathy for the

6052
04:08:19,760 --> 04:08:24,318
difficulties he's been through

6053
04:08:22,398 --> 04:08:26,000
it is not my intention to upset him with

6054
04:08:24,318 --> 04:08:27,840
these revelations

6055
04:08:26,000 --> 04:08:29,520
but rather to add a few facts to a

6056
04:08:27,840 --> 04:08:32,000
record that's been out of balance for a

6057
04:08:29,520 --> 04:08:34,880
lot of years

6058
04:08:32,000 --> 04:08:38,398
i had moved from minnesota to arizona

6059
04:08:34,879 --> 04:08:40,238
during the late summer of 1979

6060
04:08:38,398 --> 04:08:42,158
and as a result had become somewhat

6061
04:08:40,238 --> 04:08:43,600
closer to jim and carl lorenzon of the

6062
04:08:42,158 --> 04:08:45,039
old aerial phenomena research

6063
04:08:43,600 --> 04:08:46,960
organization

6064
04:08:45,040 --> 04:08:49,279
or april

6065
04:08:46,959 --> 04:08:50,879
in tucson

6066
04:08:49,279 --> 04:08:52,640
ultimately they invited me to become a

6067
04:08:50,879 --> 04:08:55,278
member of the april board of directors

6068
04:08:52,639 --> 04:08:56,959
and i accepted

6069
04:08:55,279 --> 04:08:58,479
it was in this capacity that i first

6070
04:08:56,959 --> 04:09:00,478
became acquainted with the work being

6071
04:08:58,478 --> 04:09:01,760
done by paul benowitz and dr leo

6072
04:09:00,478 --> 04:09:03,920
sprinkle

6073
04:09:01,760 --> 04:09:05,520
regarding an alleged ufo abduction

6074
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:06,960
involving a young woman and several

6075
04:09:05,520 --> 04:09:09,359
others which had occurred sometime

6076
04:09:06,959 --> 04:09:10,799
earlier

6077
04:09:09,359 --> 04:09:13,439
the woman had been hypnotically

6078
04:09:10,799 --> 04:09:15,119
regressed by dr sprinkle

6079
04:09:13,439 --> 04:09:16,880
and had provided a strange account of

6080
04:09:15,120 --> 04:09:18,159
having witnessed a cattle mutilation in

6081
04:09:16,879 --> 04:09:20,158
process

6082
04:09:18,158 --> 04:09:22,000
and subsequently having been taken by

6083
04:09:20,158 --> 04:09:23,600
her alien abductors into some sort of

6084
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:25,680
craft or facility

6085
04:09:23,600 --> 04:09:27,840
where these aliens were actively engaged

6086
04:09:25,680 --> 04:09:31,520
in processing fluids and sever severed

6087
04:09:27,840 --> 04:09:32,960
body parts obtained from these cattle

6088
04:09:31,520 --> 04:09:34,640
during the course of the hypnosis

6089
04:09:32,959 --> 04:09:37,599
sessions which began as near as i can

6090
04:09:34,639 --> 04:09:39,519
recall in august of 1979

6091
04:09:37,600 --> 04:09:41,279
benowitz had become convinced that the

6092
04:09:39,520 --> 04:09:44,560
aliens had implanted some sort of

6093
04:09:41,279 --> 04:09:46,319
communication device in the woman's head

6094
04:09:44,559 --> 04:09:48,639
and that they were using this device to

6095
04:09:46,318 --> 04:09:50,559
control her actions

6096
04:09:48,639 --> 04:09:52,398
his theory was that they could actually

6097
04:09:50,559 --> 04:09:54,398
see what she saw

6098
04:09:52,398 --> 04:09:57,278
and hear what she heard

6099
04:09:54,398 --> 04:09:58,799
by means of this device

6100
04:09:57,279 --> 04:10:00,479
in any case

6101
04:09:58,799 --> 04:10:02,000
bennowitz being a physicist by

6102
04:10:00,478 --> 04:10:03,920
profession and having a certain amount

6103
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:05,520
of electronics equipment at his disposal

6104
04:10:03,920 --> 04:10:06,639
and the wherewithal to purchase more is

6105
04:10:05,520 --> 04:10:08,399
needed

6106
04:10:06,639 --> 04:10:10,238
set out to determine whether it might be

6107
04:10:08,398 --> 04:10:12,158
possible to detect the electromagnetic

6108
04:10:10,238 --> 04:10:13,039
signals he believed these aliens must be

6109
04:10:12,158 --> 04:10:14,959
using

6110
04:10:13,040 --> 04:10:16,960
to exercise their control over their

6111
04:10:14,959 --> 04:10:18,719
alleged victims

6112
04:10:16,959 --> 04:10:21,919
and to try to devise a way to shield the

6113
04:10:18,719 --> 04:10:25,358
victim from the control of the signals

6114
04:10:21,920 --> 04:10:29,040
he dubbed his effort project beta

6115
04:10:25,359 --> 04:10:30,800
and communicated to apro in late 1979

6116
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:33,680
that he believed he had succeeded in

6117
04:10:30,799 --> 04:10:35,679
detecting signals from ufos

6118
04:10:33,680 --> 04:10:37,520
and had begun to make calculations about

6119
04:10:35,680 --> 04:10:40,880
the sort of electronic and propulsion

6120
04:10:37,520 --> 04:10:42,800
technology employed by these aliens

6121
04:10:40,879 --> 04:10:44,478
it was also at about this time that paul

6122
04:10:42,799 --> 04:10:46,079
began to take both moving and still

6123
04:10:44,478 --> 04:10:48,000
pictures of strange lights maneuvering

6124
04:10:46,079 --> 04:10:50,000
in the vicinity of the manzano nuclear

6125
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:51,600
weapons storage facility which is

6126
04:10:50,000 --> 04:10:53,520
located on the east of kirtland air

6127
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:55,279
force base in albuquerque

6128
04:10:53,520 --> 04:10:57,680
and of which benowitz had a perfect view

6129
04:10:55,279 --> 04:10:59,439
from his residence

6130
04:10:57,680 --> 04:11:01,439
benowitz was convinced that these lights

6131
04:10:59,439 --> 04:11:02,800
were ufos

6132
04:11:01,439 --> 04:11:04,840
and that for some reason they were

6133
04:11:02,799 --> 04:11:07,599
actively interested in both the manzano

6134
04:11:04,840 --> 04:11:09,600
complex and the coyote canyon test area

6135
04:11:07,600 --> 04:11:12,318
located directly south of manzano on the

6136
04:11:09,600 --> 04:11:14,238
other side of the hills

6137
04:11:12,318 --> 04:11:16,079
during this time the only awareness i

6138
04:11:14,238 --> 04:11:18,238
had of benowitz in his work was what i

6139
04:11:16,079 --> 04:11:20,639
was obtaining through april

6140
04:11:18,238 --> 04:11:22,478
i still had not met the man

6141
04:11:20,639 --> 04:11:24,079
and in fact was only mildly interested

6142
04:11:22,478 --> 04:11:26,000
in the case

6143
04:11:24,079 --> 04:11:28,000
this based largely upon both jim and

6144
04:11:26,000 --> 04:11:30,000
carl lorenzon's assessment of benowitz

6145
04:11:28,000 --> 04:11:32,799
as a dedicated researcher

6146
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:33,680
but unfortunately one who was as jim put

6147
04:11:32,799 --> 04:11:35,679
it

6148
04:11:33,680 --> 04:11:39,120
prone to make great leaps of logic on

6149
04:11:35,680 --> 04:11:41,120
the basis of incomplete data

6150
04:11:39,120 --> 04:11:42,880
both jim and coral felt that benowitz

6151
04:11:41,120 --> 04:11:46,079
had already decided what he was going to

6152
04:11:42,879 --> 04:11:47,599
find before he went looking for it

6153
04:11:46,079 --> 04:11:49,120
still

6154
04:11:47,600 --> 04:11:50,960
although i didn't come to know about it

6155
04:11:49,120 --> 04:11:52,720
until a few months later

6156
04:11:50,959 --> 04:11:55,198
there apparently was something going on

6157
04:11:52,719 --> 04:11:57,039
involving ufos near manzano particularly

6158
04:11:55,199 --> 04:11:58,880
during august september and october of

6159
04:11:57,040 --> 04:12:00,560
1980

6160
04:11:58,879 --> 04:12:02,158
and several agencies of the u.s

6161
04:12:00,559 --> 04:12:04,799
government including the air force

6162
04:12:02,158 --> 04:12:06,639
office of special investigations

6163
04:12:04,799 --> 04:12:08,639
seem more than just casually interested

6164
04:12:06,639 --> 04:12:12,079
in it

6165
04:12:08,639 --> 04:12:13,840
in early september 1980

6166
04:12:12,079 --> 04:12:15,600
i was approached by a well-placed

6167
04:12:13,840 --> 04:12:17,279
individual within the intelligence

6168
04:12:15,600 --> 04:12:18,960
community who claim to be directly

6169
04:12:17,279 --> 04:12:19,920
connected to a high-level government

6170
04:12:18,959 --> 04:12:23,039
project

6171
04:12:19,920 --> 04:12:25,760
dealing with ufos

6172
04:12:23,040 --> 04:12:28,080
this individual who subsequently came to

6173
04:12:25,760 --> 04:12:29,920
be known as the falcon

6174
04:12:28,079 --> 04:12:31,359
told me that he spoke for a small group

6175
04:12:29,920 --> 04:12:32,719
of similar individuals who were

6176
04:12:31,359 --> 04:12:35,040
uncomfortable with the government's

6177
04:12:32,719 --> 04:12:36,719
continuing cover-up of the truth

6178
04:12:35,040 --> 04:12:38,479
and indicated that he and his group

6179
04:12:36,719 --> 04:12:40,000
would like to help me with my research

6180
04:12:38,478 --> 04:12:41,679
into the subject

6181
04:12:40,000 --> 04:12:43,040
in the hope that i might be able to help

6182
04:12:41,680 --> 04:12:44,880
them find a way to change their

6183
04:12:43,040 --> 04:12:48,479
prevailing policy and get the facts out

6184
04:12:44,879 --> 04:12:51,599
without breaking any laws in the process

6185
04:12:48,478 --> 04:12:56,478
i knew i was being recruited

6186
04:12:51,600 --> 04:12:56,479
but at that point i had no idea for what

6187
04:12:56,559 --> 04:13:00,238
in any case i was told that if i was

6188
04:12:58,719 --> 04:13:02,318
interested in cooperating with their

6189
04:13:00,238 --> 04:13:04,238
group i would further be contacted by a

6190
04:13:02,318 --> 04:13:05,920
liaison man

6191
04:13:04,238 --> 04:13:07,600
and that future meetings between me and

6192
04:13:05,920 --> 04:13:09,760
the falcon would be arranged by this

6193
04:13:07,600 --> 04:13:12,158
person

6194
04:13:09,760 --> 04:13:14,158
the liaison person who subsequently made

6195
04:13:12,158 --> 04:13:17,600
contact with me

6196
04:13:14,158 --> 04:13:19,279
was afosi agent richard doty

6197
04:13:17,600 --> 04:13:21,840
a man who has since become quite

6198
04:13:19,279 --> 04:13:23,520
controversial in his own right

6199
04:13:21,840 --> 04:13:27,120
and who many people have mistakenly

6200
04:13:23,520 --> 04:13:30,158
assumed as the falcon himself

6201
04:13:27,120 --> 04:13:31,199
the story of my contacts with the falcon

6202
04:13:30,158 --> 04:13:33,920
doty

6203
04:13:31,199 --> 04:13:35,600
and subsequently a number of others

6204
04:13:33,920 --> 04:13:38,000
is something i will have considerably

6205
04:13:35,600 --> 04:13:39,760
more to say about at a later date

6206
04:13:38,000 --> 04:13:41,120
i'm fully aware that such a course of

6207
04:13:39,760 --> 04:13:42,880
action will undoubtedly prompt the

6208
04:13:41,120 --> 04:13:44,560
gospel gossip mongers to begin

6209
04:13:42,879 --> 04:13:46,719
circulating an entirely new array of

6210
04:13:44,559 --> 04:13:48,879
outrageous and unsubstantiated rumors

6211
04:13:46,719 --> 04:13:50,639
but so be it

6212
04:13:48,879 --> 04:13:52,158
my purpose here is to deal only with

6213
04:13:50,639 --> 04:13:55,039
that part of the story which is directly

6214
04:13:52,158 --> 04:13:56,478
connected to the benewit's affair

6215
04:13:55,040 --> 04:13:59,199
to those of you who want to know more

6216
04:13:56,478 --> 04:14:01,679
after hearing what i had to say tonight

6217
04:13:59,199 --> 04:14:03,279
i counsel continued patience

6218
04:14:01,680 --> 04:14:05,120
you have my assurance that the rest of

6219
04:14:03,279 --> 04:14:06,560
the story will ultimately be told as

6220
04:14:05,120 --> 04:14:08,399
well

6221
04:14:06,559 --> 04:14:10,079
but before going back to the benowitz

6222
04:14:08,398 --> 04:14:11,760
affair

6223
04:14:10,079 --> 04:14:14,639
let me make several points which seem

6224
04:14:11,760 --> 04:14:16,238
appropriate at this juncture

6225
04:14:14,639 --> 04:14:17,920
first of all

6226
04:14:16,238 --> 04:14:19,439
on the question of richard dodie and the

6227
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:21,520
falcon

6228
04:14:19,439 --> 04:14:23,760
it's important to note that the name

6229
04:14:21,520 --> 04:14:27,760
falcon was invented by my partner jamie

6230
04:14:23,760 --> 04:14:29,600
chanderay and i in 1984

6231
04:14:27,760 --> 04:14:31,680
strictly as a way of facilitating our

6232
04:14:29,600 --> 04:14:34,559
talking to each other about this person

6233
04:14:31,680 --> 04:14:37,439
particularly on the telephone

6234
04:14:34,559 --> 04:14:39,600
without having to use a name

6235
04:14:37,439 --> 04:14:42,800
richard doty who continued to be liaison

6236
04:14:39,600 --> 04:14:46,479
man was similarly referred to us

6237
04:14:42,799 --> 04:14:48,238
or by us as the sparrow

6238
04:14:46,478 --> 04:14:49,840
neither sparrow nor falcon were aware

6239
04:14:48,238 --> 04:14:52,559
that we were using these terms in

6240
04:14:49,840 --> 04:14:54,318
reference to them nor was anyone else

6241
04:14:52,559 --> 04:14:58,119
to the best of my knowledge

6242
04:14:54,318 --> 04:14:58,119
prior to about mid-1985

6243
04:14:58,639 --> 04:15:04,000
it was in mid-1987

6244
04:15:01,680 --> 04:15:05,600
just after we went public with the mj-12

6245
04:15:04,000 --> 04:15:07,439
papers

6246
04:15:05,600 --> 04:15:09,680
that at falcon's suggestion and with the

6247
04:15:07,439 --> 04:15:11,439
concurrence of richard doty

6248
04:15:09,680 --> 04:15:15,279
we began dropping subtle hints that

6249
04:15:11,439 --> 04:15:17,040
falcon might in fact be doty

6250
04:15:15,279 --> 04:15:18,800
falcon felt that such a ploy would be

6251
04:15:17,040 --> 04:15:20,880
useful to him in continuing to protect

6252
04:15:18,799 --> 04:15:22,478
his identity

6253
04:15:20,879 --> 04:15:24,478
while dodi for his part said that if

6254
04:15:22,478 --> 04:15:26,719
anybody asked he could simply deny it

6255
04:15:24,478 --> 04:15:28,238
and that would be that

6256
04:15:26,719 --> 04:15:31,438
we agreed

6257
04:15:28,238 --> 04:15:33,039
and as many of you are painfully aware

6258
04:15:31,439 --> 04:15:35,279
it turned out to be an excellent

6259
04:15:33,040 --> 04:15:36,880
diversion

6260
04:15:35,279 --> 04:15:39,040
particularly with respect to the

6261
04:15:36,879 --> 04:15:41,119
affected head following the ufo cover-up

6262
04:15:39,040 --> 04:15:44,319
live show which was podcast nationally

6263
04:15:41,120 --> 04:15:47,199
in october 1988

6264
04:15:44,318 --> 04:15:49,119
in all fairness to mr doty here

6265
04:15:47,199 --> 04:15:50,640
i should also like to comment that in my

6266
04:15:49,120 --> 04:15:52,479
assessment

6267
04:15:50,639 --> 04:15:54,639
rick is much better at following orders

6268
04:15:52,478 --> 04:15:56,318
and implementing the schemes of others

6269
04:15:54,639 --> 04:15:58,398
than he is at coming up with ideas of

6270
04:15:56,318 --> 04:16:00,238
his own

6271
04:15:58,398 --> 04:16:02,398
those of you that have devoted time and

6272
04:16:00,238 --> 04:16:04,398
energy to constantly badgering this man

6273
04:16:02,398 --> 04:16:06,079
for more information

6274
04:16:04,398 --> 04:16:09,119
should be aware that all you are doing

6275
04:16:06,079 --> 04:16:11,279
is making nuisances of yourself

6276
04:16:09,120 --> 04:16:13,040
rick is not the man you're after

6277
04:16:11,279 --> 04:16:15,439
it's the person in the control position

6278
04:16:13,040 --> 04:16:17,920
that's important here

6279
04:16:15,439 --> 04:16:19,840
and as far as i'm aware

6280
04:16:17,920 --> 04:16:21,520
no one outside of my project has any

6281
04:16:19,840 --> 04:16:24,238
idea who that person might be or what

6282
04:16:21,520 --> 04:16:24,238
his motives are

6283
04:16:24,559 --> 04:16:28,079
in any case

6284
04:16:26,398 --> 04:16:30,719
it was falcon who sought me out in

6285
04:16:28,079 --> 04:16:32,799
september of 1980

6286
04:16:30,719 --> 04:16:34,959
and it was richard doty

6287
04:16:32,799 --> 04:16:35,920
then with afosi at kirtland air force

6288
04:16:34,959 --> 04:16:37,839
base

6289
04:16:35,920 --> 04:16:40,478
who soon came into play as the middleman

6290
04:16:37,840 --> 04:16:42,559
in that process

6291
04:16:40,478 --> 04:16:44,238
shortly thereafter

6292
04:16:42,559 --> 04:16:47,359
it became apparent to me that my

6293
04:16:44,238 --> 04:16:48,959
supplying information to the government

6294
04:16:47,359 --> 04:16:52,158
through doty

6295
04:16:48,959 --> 04:16:53,519
on the activities of paul benowitz

6296
04:16:52,158 --> 04:16:55,520
april

6297
04:16:53,520 --> 04:16:56,800
and to a lesser extent several other

6298
04:16:55,520 --> 04:17:00,640
individuals

6299
04:16:56,799 --> 04:17:02,639
was to be a part of this equation

6300
04:17:00,639 --> 04:17:05,198
i also discovered that whatever it was

6301
04:17:02,639 --> 04:17:06,959
that benowitz was involved with

6302
04:17:05,199 --> 04:17:09,279
he was the subject of considerable

6303
04:17:06,959 --> 04:17:12,000
interest on the part of not one but

6304
04:17:09,279 --> 04:17:13,520
several government agencies

6305
04:17:12,000 --> 04:17:15,478
and that they were actively trying to

6306
04:17:13,520 --> 04:17:17,840
defuse him by pumping as much

6307
04:17:15,478 --> 04:17:21,198
mis-disinformation through him

6308
04:17:17,840 --> 04:17:23,199
as he could possibly absorb

6309
04:17:21,199 --> 04:17:24,720
being a very small part of that process

6310
04:17:23,199 --> 04:17:26,800
gave me i thought something of an

6311
04:17:24,719 --> 04:17:28,639
advantage

6312
04:17:26,799 --> 04:17:30,238
it became my intention to play that

6313
04:17:28,639 --> 04:17:33,119
advantage for all the information i

6314
04:17:30,238 --> 04:17:33,119
could get out of it

6315
04:17:33,279 --> 04:17:36,720
benowitz for his part continued to make

6316
04:17:35,199 --> 04:17:39,600
what in my opinion seem to be

6317
04:17:36,719 --> 04:17:41,358
increasingly irrational claims

6318
04:17:39,600 --> 04:17:42,960
most of which gave every appearance of

6319
04:17:41,359 --> 04:17:45,520
having been influenced by a heavy

6320
04:17:42,959 --> 04:17:47,198
blanket of disinformation

6321
04:17:45,520 --> 04:17:49,439
mixed with a small but significant

6322
04:17:47,199 --> 04:17:51,279
amount of truth

6323
04:17:49,439 --> 04:17:53,600
the problem was always one of keeping a

6324
04:17:51,279 --> 04:17:56,238
level head and trying to carefully sort

6325
04:17:53,600 --> 04:17:57,680
the from the candy

6326
04:17:56,238 --> 04:18:00,000
something which paul didn't seem to be

6327
04:17:57,680 --> 04:18:02,000
very good at

6328
04:18:00,000 --> 04:18:04,158
but then paul was by that time very

6329
04:18:02,000 --> 04:18:05,840
emotionally involved with the affair and

6330
04:18:04,158 --> 04:18:07,359
rather skeptical of advice from any

6331
04:18:05,840 --> 04:18:10,158
quarter unless it supported what he had

6332
04:18:07,359 --> 04:18:12,318
already decided was the truth

6333
04:18:10,158 --> 04:18:14,158
from my vantage point

6334
04:18:12,318 --> 04:18:15,680
being detached from the mainstream but

6335
04:18:14,158 --> 04:18:17,359
still close enough to appreciate what

6336
04:18:15,680 --> 04:18:19,199
was happening

6337
04:18:17,359 --> 04:18:21,600
it was somewhat easier to assess the

6338
04:18:19,199 --> 04:18:25,520
process

6339
04:18:21,600 --> 04:18:27,199
i first met paul in early 1981

6340
04:18:25,520 --> 04:18:31,359
and continued contacts with him on a

6341
04:18:27,199 --> 04:18:34,720
fairly regular basis through mid-1985

6342
04:18:31,359 --> 04:18:36,640
contact since then has been sporadic

6343
04:18:34,719 --> 04:18:38,879
my role in the affair was largely that

6344
04:18:36,639 --> 04:18:40,719
of a freelancer providing information on

6345
04:18:38,879 --> 04:18:42,318
paul's then current thinking and

6346
04:18:40,719 --> 04:18:44,238
activities

6347
04:18:42,318 --> 04:18:45,359
i had nothing whatsoever to do with the

6348
04:18:44,238 --> 04:18:47,520
counter intelligence and the

6349
04:18:45,359 --> 04:18:49,520
disinformation

6350
04:18:47,520 --> 04:18:51,359
although i either knew

6351
04:18:49,520 --> 04:18:52,800
or was aware of a number of people

6352
04:18:51,359 --> 04:18:54,399
directly involved with that end of

6353
04:18:52,799 --> 04:18:57,278
things

6354
04:18:54,398 --> 04:18:58,719
richard doty was one of these people

6355
04:18:57,279 --> 04:19:00,079
although i came to know dodie well

6356
04:18:58,719 --> 04:19:02,318
enough to gain the impression that he

6357
04:19:00,079 --> 04:19:05,920
was faithfully carrying out orders which

6358
04:19:02,318 --> 04:19:07,439
he personally found distasteful

6359
04:19:05,920 --> 04:19:09,680
perhaps it was for this reason that the

6360
04:19:07,439 --> 04:19:12,318
falcon had chosen him as liaison person

6361
04:19:09,680 --> 04:19:14,158
although i don't really know

6362
04:19:12,318 --> 04:19:15,600
frankly i don't believe that dodie does

6363
04:19:14,158 --> 04:19:18,079
either

6364
04:19:15,600 --> 04:19:20,318
in my opinion he was simply a pawn

6365
04:19:18,079 --> 04:19:23,279
in a much larger game

6366
04:19:20,318 --> 04:19:23,278
just as i was

6367
04:19:23,840 --> 04:19:28,000
as for bennewitz

6368
04:19:25,600 --> 04:19:30,000
by 1981 he was gathering data from a

6369
04:19:28,000 --> 04:19:31,840
variety of sources and amalgamating it

6370
04:19:30,000 --> 04:19:34,079
with information being fed to him by a

6371
04:19:31,840 --> 04:19:35,439
number of government people in whom for

6372
04:19:34,079 --> 04:19:38,238
some reason he seemed to have an

6373
04:19:35,439 --> 04:19:40,318
implicit and abiding faith

6374
04:19:38,238 --> 04:19:42,639
the story that emerged from this melange

6375
04:19:40,318 --> 04:19:44,959
of fact fiction fantasy hearsay heart

6376
04:19:42,639 --> 04:19:47,439
data and government disinformation was

6377
04:19:44,959 --> 04:19:50,398
absolutely incredible

6378
04:19:47,439 --> 04:19:52,639
yet somehow paul believed in it

6379
04:19:50,398 --> 04:19:54,318
and set out on a one-man crusade to tell

6380
04:19:52,639 --> 04:19:55,278
the world that malevolent aliens from

6381
04:19:54,318 --> 04:19:56,799
space

6382
04:19:55,279 --> 04:19:59,359
were in league with our government to

6383
04:19:56,799 --> 04:20:02,079
take over the planet

6384
04:19:59,359 --> 04:20:04,079
what had begun in 1979 is an effort to

6385
04:20:02,079 --> 04:20:06,398
learn whether the behavior of a woman

6386
04:20:04,079 --> 04:20:08,398
who claimed she had been abducted by ufo

6387
04:20:06,398 --> 04:20:11,198
aliens and was being influenced by some

6388
04:20:08,398 --> 04:20:13,039
sort of radio remote control

6389
04:20:11,199 --> 04:20:14,800
had in the space of less than three

6390
04:20:13,040 --> 04:20:16,800
years

6391
04:20:14,799 --> 04:20:19,519
blossomed into a tale which rivaled the

6392
04:20:16,799 --> 04:20:22,559
wildest science fiction scenario anyone

6393
04:20:19,520 --> 04:20:24,319
could possibly imagine

6394
04:20:22,559 --> 04:20:26,719
basically it seemed to me that paul was

6395
04:20:24,318 --> 04:20:28,398
his own worst enemy instead of

6396
04:20:26,719 --> 04:20:30,158
withholding judgment until all of the

6397
04:20:28,398 --> 04:20:31,840
facts were in paul insisted on

6398
04:20:30,158 --> 04:20:34,318
repeatedly going off half cop to

6399

6407
04:20:50,478 --> 04:20:53,760
efforts to reach out and tell the world

6408
04:20:52,158 --> 04:20:55,359
what he sincerely believed to be

6409
04:20:53,760 --> 04:20:57,279
happening

6410
04:20:55,359 --> 04:20:59,040
he wrote letters and made phone calls by

6411
04:20:57,279 --> 04:21:00,800
the hundreds

6412
04:20:59,040 --> 04:21:02,560
and to those who had neither the time

6413
04:21:00,799 --> 04:21:04,238
nor the inclination to look behind the

6414
04:21:02,559 --> 04:21:05,680
words for a better understanding of the

6415
04:21:04,238 --> 04:21:07,840
facts

6416
04:21:05,680 --> 04:21:10,398
paul with his professional credentials

6417
04:21:07,840 --> 04:21:12,719
and technical vocabulary came off as a

6418
04:21:10,398 --> 04:21:14,318
rather credible individual

6419
04:21:12,719 --> 04:21:15,760
which must have caused quite a rash of

6420
04:21:14,318 --> 04:21:17,760
headaches among the people in high

6421
04:21:15,760 --> 04:21:21,238
places who were desperately trying to

6422
04:21:17,760 --> 04:21:21,238
defuse him

6423
04:21:28,260 --> 04:21:32,960
[Music]

6424
04:21:30,318 --> 04:21:34,840
the idea that ufos had something to do

6425
04:21:32,959 --> 04:21:37,519
with the

6426
04:21:34,840 --> 04:21:40,079
phenomenon number two

6427
04:21:37,520 --> 04:21:42,158
an increasing number of ufo cases

6428
04:21:40,079 --> 04:21:43,199
wherein the individual or individuals

6429
04:21:42,158 --> 04:21:45,039
involved

6430
04:21:43,199 --> 04:21:46,640
claim to have been abducted by ufo

6431
04:21:45,040 --> 04:21:48,720
aliens and taken aboard their craft

6432
04:21:46,639 --> 04:21:50,719
against their will

6433
04:21:48,719 --> 04:21:52,959
public exposure to this phenomenon got a

6434
04:21:50,719 --> 04:21:54,478
big boost in 1981

6435
04:21:52,959 --> 04:21:56,398
with the appearance of bud hopkins

6436
04:21:54,478 --> 04:21:58,478
bestseller missing time

6437
04:21:56,398 --> 04:22:00,478
and paul was particularly interested in

6438
04:21:58,478 --> 04:22:02,318
these cases

6439
04:22:00,478 --> 04:22:03,519
his hypothesis that people were being

6440
04:22:02,318 --> 04:22:05,119
abducted

6441
04:22:03,520 --> 04:22:06,479
implanted with some kind of alien

6442
04:22:05,120 --> 04:22:08,079
control device

6443
04:22:06,478 --> 04:22:09,679
and then being let go again was

6444
04:22:08,079 --> 04:22:11,520
completely consistent with the thinking

6445
04:22:09,680 --> 04:22:13,199
of a number of other ufo researchers at

6446
04:22:11,520 --> 04:22:15,279
the time

6447
04:22:13,199 --> 04:22:17,199
paul's hypothesis however

6448
04:22:15,279 --> 04:22:19,840
had a somewhat more sinister spin than

6449
04:22:17,199 --> 04:22:19,840
most

6450
04:22:20,079 --> 04:22:22,799
third

6451
04:22:20,959 --> 04:22:24,478
his own experiments and research

6452
04:22:22,799 --> 04:22:26,158
regarding the radio signals he was

6453
04:22:24,478 --> 04:22:29,358
receiving in the photographs and film

6454
04:22:26,158 --> 04:22:31,600
footage he was getting of unusual lights

6455
04:22:29,359 --> 04:22:33,040
both of these phenomena seemed largely

6456
04:22:31,600 --> 04:22:34,800
though not entirely connected with

6457
04:22:33,040 --> 04:22:37,439
goings on within the kirtland air force

6458
04:22:34,799 --> 04:22:39,599
base sandia national lab complex just

6459
04:22:37,439 --> 04:22:41,040
south of albuquerque

6460
04:22:39,600 --> 04:22:42,960
there is no question that paul was

6461
04:22:41,040 --> 04:22:45,040
receiving some sort of electromagnetic

6462
04:22:42,959 --> 04:22:46,398
signal on his equipment

6463
04:22:45,040 --> 04:22:48,319
and it is equally certain that his

6464
04:22:46,398 --> 04:22:49,599
photos and films do depict unusual

6465
04:22:48,318 --> 04:22:51,278
lights

6466
04:22:49,600 --> 04:22:53,439
most of which were filmed while hovering

6467
04:22:51,279 --> 04:22:54,800
or maneuvering over the kirtland sandia

6468
04:22:53,439 --> 04:22:56,960
complex

6469
04:22:54,799 --> 04:22:58,719
the real question here however is

6470
04:22:56,959 --> 04:23:00,478
whether paul's evidence is sufficient to

6471
04:22:58,719 --> 04:23:03,438
conclude that either of these phenomena

6472
04:23:00,478 --> 04:23:05,760
was directly related to ufo activity

6473
04:23:03,439 --> 04:23:08,000
or whether in fact a prosaic explanation

6474
04:23:05,760 --> 04:23:11,040
exists which is more directly related to

6475
04:23:08,000 --> 04:23:13,840
some classified government project

6476
04:23:11,040 --> 04:23:15,680
admittedly strong arguments can be made

6477
04:23:13,840 --> 04:23:17,520
in both directions

6478
04:23:15,680 --> 04:23:19,680
either one of which can be offered as an

6479
04:23:17,520 --> 04:23:21,520
adequate explanation of the government's

6480
04:23:19,680 --> 04:23:22,479
counter-intelligence activities in this

6481
04:23:21,520 --> 04:23:25,040
case

6482
04:23:22,478 --> 04:23:26,959
which was the fourth factor

6483
04:23:25,040 --> 04:23:28,399
government surveillance of paul and his

6484
04:23:26,959 --> 04:23:30,079
activities

6485
04:23:28,398 --> 04:23:31,680
some of which paul was astute enough to

6486
04:23:30,079 --> 04:23:35,279
detect and some of which i had learned

6487
04:23:31,680 --> 04:23:35,279
about that paul seemed unaware of

6488
04:23:36,238 --> 04:23:39,840
paul took the surveillance activities

6489
04:23:37,920 --> 04:23:42,398
which included wiretaps and according to

6490
04:23:39,840 --> 04:23:45,359
paul even break-ins as proof positive

6491
04:23:42,398 --> 04:23:48,478
that he was on to something big

6492
04:23:45,359 --> 04:23:50,238
unfortunately he seemed largely unaware

6493
04:23:48,478 --> 04:23:52,238
that the same people

6494
04:23:50,238 --> 04:23:53,439
who would go to such lengths to spy on

6495
04:23:52,238 --> 04:23:55,359
him

6496
04:23:53,439 --> 04:23:59,199
also had the capabilities to mount an

6497
04:23:55,359 --> 04:24:02,399
effective disinformation campaign

6498
04:23:59,199 --> 04:24:04,239
in any case by mid-1982

6499
04:24:02,398 --> 04:24:06,238
paul's story contained virtually all of

6500
04:24:04,238 --> 04:24:08,478
the elements found in the current crop

6501
04:24:06,238 --> 04:24:10,639
of rumors being circulated around the

6502
04:24:08,478 --> 04:24:12,719
ufo community

6503
04:24:10,639 --> 04:24:16,158
there were two groups of aliens

6504
04:24:12,719 --> 04:24:18,079
one malevolent one more friendly

6505
04:24:16,158 --> 04:24:21,039
the malevolent ones which paul referred

6506
04:24:18,079 --> 04:24:23,199
to as the grays were really in control

6507
04:24:21,040 --> 04:24:25,040
and they were the ones responsible for

6508
04:24:23,199 --> 04:24:26,800
the cattle mutilations

6509
04:24:25,040 --> 04:24:28,479
for human abductions

6510
04:24:26,799 --> 04:24:30,559
and the implanting of sinister control

6511
04:24:28,478 --> 04:24:32,318
devices in humans

6512
04:24:30,559 --> 04:24:35,119
for having first made and then broken

6513
04:24:32,318 --> 04:24:36,879
the secret treaty with the us government

6514
04:24:35,120 --> 04:24:38,960
for maintaining a secret underground

6515
04:24:36,879 --> 04:24:41,119
base under archuleta peak near dulce in

6516
04:24:38,959 --> 04:24:42,639
northwestern new mexico

6517
04:24:41,120 --> 04:24:44,399
and for having supplied the us

6518
04:24:42,639 --> 04:24:46,000
government with aliens based hardware

6519
04:24:44,398 --> 04:24:48,799
and weapons which ultimately proved

6520
04:24:46,000 --> 04:24:50,478
defective or which were caused to crash

6521
04:24:48,799 --> 04:24:53,759
thus leaving human civilization

6522
04:24:50,478 --> 04:24:55,920
virtually defenseless against invasion

6523
04:24:53,760 --> 04:24:57,840
according to paul

6524
04:24:55,920 --> 04:24:59,359
an atomic powered spaceship which they

6525
04:24:57,840 --> 04:25:01,359
had given to the us

6526
04:24:59,359 --> 04:25:03,120
had been caused to crash an archuleta

6527
04:25:01,359 --> 04:25:04,559
peak near the entrance to an underground

6528
04:25:03,120 --> 04:25:06,399
alien base

6529
04:25:04,559 --> 04:25:08,879
and it sprayed the entire area with

6530
04:25:06,398 --> 04:25:10,158
radioactivity and wreckage

6531
04:25:08,879 --> 04:25:12,000
to prove it

6532
04:25:10,158 --> 04:25:14,799
he provided drawings which he said he

6533
04:25:12,000 --> 04:25:17,199
had made from photographs

6534
04:25:14,799 --> 04:25:18,879
i and others would examine paul's

6535
04:25:17,199 --> 04:25:21,040
photographs as well as independently

6536
04:25:18,879 --> 04:25:22,079
explain obtained pictures of the same

6537
04:25:21,040 --> 04:25:24,319
area

6538
04:25:22,079 --> 04:25:25,840
were unable to see what paul claimed was

6539
04:25:24,318 --> 04:25:28,158
there

6540
04:25:25,840 --> 04:25:30,639
where he saw a crashed ship

6541
04:25:28,158 --> 04:25:33,199
burned wreckage entrances to the alien

6542
04:25:30,639 --> 04:25:35,760
base and weapons pointing skyward

6543
04:25:33,199 --> 04:25:37,600
others could only see rocks trees and

6544
04:25:35,760 --> 04:25:39,680
shadows

6545
04:25:37,600 --> 04:25:42,000
i have no doubt that paul believed that

6546
04:25:39,680 --> 04:25:44,960
he saw what he claimed

6547
04:25:42,000 --> 04:25:48,000
and for this i offer no explanation

6548
04:25:44,959 --> 04:25:51,438
i only know that what he claimed to see

6549
04:25:48,000 --> 04:25:51,439
wasn't what others saw

6550
04:25:51,520 --> 04:25:56,880
there is no question that some of

6551
04:25:53,040 --> 04:25:59,120
benowitz's pictures are interesting

6552
04:25:56,879 --> 04:26:00,639
but i must say that even though i viewed

6553
04:25:59,120 --> 04:26:02,239
a large number of them

6554
04:26:00,639 --> 04:26:04,238
i never saw one that i could get

6555
04:26:02,238 --> 04:26:05,840
particularly excited about

6556
04:26:04,238 --> 04:26:07,439
and i certainly never saw anything that

6557
04:26:05,840 --> 04:26:09,600
i felt could be pointed to as proof

6558
04:26:07,439 --> 04:26:11,040
positive or even compelling evidence

6559
04:26:09,600 --> 04:26:13,040
that he was photographing alien

6560
04:26:11,040 --> 04:26:14,479
spacecraft

6561
04:26:13,040 --> 04:26:16,239
much of his film was super eight

6562
04:26:14,478 --> 04:26:19,438
millimeter which is too small a format

6563
04:26:16,238 --> 04:26:19,439
for good quality enlargement

6564
04:26:19,680 --> 04:26:23,520
there is also no question that paul was

6565
04:26:21,520 --> 04:26:26,319
intercepting some kind of low frequency

6566
04:26:23,520 --> 04:26:28,640
electromagnetic emission

6567
04:26:26,318 --> 04:26:30,799
the question was and remains

6568
04:26:28,639 --> 04:26:32,879
where was it coming from

6569
04:26:30,799 --> 04:26:34,959
what was its purpose

6570
04:26:32,879 --> 04:26:38,318
and indeed most importantly

6571
04:26:34,959 --> 04:26:40,799
was it ufo related at all

6572
04:26:38,318 --> 04:26:42,719
paul at least was totally convinced

6573
04:26:40,799 --> 04:26:44,719
that he was receiving alien radio

6574
04:26:42,719 --> 04:26:46,719
transmissions

6575
04:26:44,719 --> 04:26:48,478
and had even gone so far as to develop a

6576
04:26:46,719 --> 04:26:51,438
home computer program capable of

6577
04:26:48,478 --> 04:26:53,198
translating them into english

6578
04:26:51,439 --> 04:26:54,880
the problem as i saw it was that his

6579
04:26:53,199 --> 04:26:56,399
program which he told me had been

6580
04:26:54,879 --> 04:26:58,719
developed with the assistance of the

6581
04:26:56,398 --> 04:27:01,119
aliens themselves

6582
04:26:58,719 --> 04:27:02,719
assigned entire words

6583
04:27:01,120 --> 04:27:05,120
sentence fragments

6584
04:27:02,719 --> 04:27:06,398
and sometimes even entire sentences

6585
04:27:05,120 --> 04:27:08,399
themselves

6586
04:27:06,398 --> 04:27:11,198
to the various individual pulses of

6587
04:27:08,398 --> 04:27:13,599
energy within these transmissions

6588
04:27:11,199 --> 04:27:15,920
the technique involved was such that it

6589
04:27:13,600 --> 04:27:18,399
could just as easily have been adapted

6590
04:27:15,920 --> 04:27:20,079
to assign similar alien translations to

6591
04:27:18,398 --> 04:27:22,799
the various energy pulses found in

6592
04:27:20,079 --> 04:27:24,478
ordinary morse code

6593
04:27:22,799 --> 04:27:26,079
i have a number of paul's computer

6594
04:27:24,478 --> 04:27:28,238
printouts

6595
04:27:26,079 --> 04:27:31,359
which contain translations of those

6596
04:27:28,238 --> 04:27:33,039
allegedly alien messages

6597
04:27:31,359 --> 04:27:34,960
if one breaks these apart into their

6598
04:27:33,040 --> 04:27:36,239
component words sentence fragments and

6599
04:27:34,959 --> 04:27:38,959
sentences

6600
04:27:36,238 --> 04:27:41,039
and then shuffles the components

6601
04:27:38,959 --> 04:27:42,799
the result is such that the new message

6602
04:27:41,040 --> 04:27:44,399
says virtually the same thing as the old

6603
04:27:42,799 --> 04:27:46,639
one

6604
04:27:44,398 --> 04:27:48,478
the messages look fascinating

6605
04:27:46,639 --> 04:27:50,719
until one examines the method by which

6606
04:27:48,478 --> 04:27:52,799
they were derived

6607
04:27:50,719 --> 04:27:54,559
after that they are not nearly so

6608
04:27:52,799 --> 04:27:56,478
interesting

6609
04:27:54,559 --> 04:27:58,478
unfortunately lots of people saw the

6610
04:27:56,478 --> 04:28:00,559
messages

6611
04:27:58,478 --> 04:28:02,318
very few had the opportunity to examine

6612
04:28:00,559 --> 04:28:04,398
the computer program which generated

6613
04:28:02,318 --> 04:28:04,398
them

6614
04:28:04,879 --> 04:28:08,079
along these same lines at least some of

6615
04:28:06,799 --> 04:28:10,000
the things paul was seeing and

6616
04:28:08,079 --> 04:28:13,600
identifying his alien spacecraft were

6617
04:28:10,000 --> 04:28:15,279
definitely not ufos at all

6618
04:28:13,600 --> 04:28:17,600
one evening while visiting him we went

6619
04:28:15,279 --> 04:28:19,199
out in his sun deck just at twilight

6620
04:28:17,600 --> 04:28:21,120
and he pointed out a series of lights

6621
04:28:19,199 --> 04:28:24,720
slowly maneuvering far out over the west

6622
04:28:21,120 --> 04:28:26,800
mesa perhaps 25 or 30 miles away

6623
04:28:24,719 --> 04:28:30,238
these he said were alien craft involved

6624
04:28:26,799 --> 04:28:32,158
in abducting people and implanting them

6625
04:28:30,238 --> 04:28:34,000
there certainly were lights maneuvering

6626
04:28:32,158 --> 04:28:35,600
out there

6627
04:28:34,000 --> 04:28:38,318
but even through good binoculars they

6628
04:28:35,600 --> 04:28:41,680
were not readily identifiable

6629
04:28:38,318 --> 04:28:43,119
paul insisted they were ufos

6630
04:28:41,680 --> 04:28:44,880
and showed us how to conduct a little

6631
04:28:43,120 --> 04:28:47,439
test with our binoculars which he said

6632
04:28:44,879 --> 04:28:48,559
would prove it

6633
04:28:47,439 --> 04:28:51,600
interested

6634
04:28:48,559 --> 04:28:53,439
but unconvinced i drove directly to west

6635
04:28:51,600 --> 04:28:55,279
mesa immediately after leaving paul's

6636
04:28:53,439 --> 04:28:56,720
home and parked my car at a spot where i

6637
04:28:55,279 --> 04:28:59,680
felt i would be able to get a good look

6638
04:28:56,719 --> 04:29:01,039
at anything flying around that area

6639
04:28:59,680 --> 04:29:03,199
sure enough

6640
04:29:01,040 --> 04:29:05,680
helicopters carrying large searchlights

6641
04:29:03,199 --> 04:29:09,199
began to maneuver slowly over my vantage

6642
04:29:05,680 --> 04:29:11,199
point only moments after i arrived

6643
04:29:09,199 --> 04:29:13,279
one went directly over me at an altitude

6644
04:29:11,199 --> 04:29:15,359
of about 300 feet

6645
04:29:13,279 --> 04:29:17,279
and there is no doubt that it was a

6646
04:29:15,359 --> 04:29:19,760
helicopter

6647
04:29:17,279 --> 04:29:21,279
the next day i called kirtland

6648
04:29:19,760 --> 04:29:22,960
and they confirmed to me that there had

6649
04:29:21,279 --> 04:29:25,840
indeed been a search and rescue training

6650
04:29:22,959 --> 04:29:27,599
mission in that area the night before

6651
04:29:25,840 --> 04:29:28,960
such operations they informed me were

6652
04:29:27,600 --> 04:29:30,720
conducted over that area quite

6653
04:29:28,959 --> 04:29:33,599
frequently

6654
04:29:30,719 --> 04:29:36,318
that was in 1982.

6655
04:29:33,600 --> 04:29:38,238
two years later in 1984

6656
04:29:36,318 --> 04:29:39,920
paul was still making the same claims

6657
04:29:38,238 --> 04:29:42,639
about these maneuvering lights to other

6658
04:29:39,920 --> 04:29:44,398
ufo researchers

6659
04:29:42,639 --> 04:29:46,000
as far as i'm aware

6660
04:29:44,398 --> 04:29:48,398
i was the only one who took the trouble

6661
04:29:46,000 --> 04:29:48,398
to check

6662
04:29:48,559 --> 04:29:52,719
paul is a convincing and compelling

6663
04:29:50,478 --> 04:29:54,879
individual in person

6664
04:29:52,719 --> 04:29:56,639
he talks an excellent story

6665
04:29:54,879 --> 04:29:58,158
and it's easy to see why so many people

6666
04:29:56,639 --> 04:30:00,000
have been so intrigued by it over the

6667
04:29:58,158 --> 04:30:01,520
years

6668
04:30:00,000 --> 04:30:02,879
unfortunately

6669
04:30:01,520 --> 04:30:04,640
too many of the people who have

6670
04:30:02,879 --> 04:30:07,278
interviewed paul have chosen to draw

6671
04:30:04,639 --> 04:30:10,719
their conclusions about him based solely

6672
04:30:07,279 --> 04:30:13,279
or largely upon what he says

6673
04:30:10,719 --> 04:30:14,879
and not upon the entire body of evidence

6674
04:30:13,279 --> 04:30:17,439
presented by the larger picture of the

6675
04:30:14,879 --> 04:30:19,759
case itself

6676
04:30:17,439 --> 04:30:21,920
i too have spent considerable time with

6677
04:30:19,760 --> 04:30:23,520
paul over a period of years

6678
04:30:21,920 --> 04:30:25,520
and came to know him quite well in that

6679
04:30:23,520 --> 04:30:27,279
process

6680
04:30:25,520 --> 04:30:29,279
as already stated

6681
04:30:27,279 --> 04:30:31,279
i viewed a large number of paul's films

6682
04:30:29,279 --> 04:30:33,120
and photographs

6683
04:30:31,279 --> 04:30:34,800
i carefully examined satellite and

6684
04:30:33,120 --> 04:30:36,720
aerial survey photographs of both

6685
04:30:34,799 --> 04:30:38,398
archuleta peak and mesa

6686
04:30:36,719 --> 04:30:40,959
as well as aerial photos of the area

6687
04:30:38,398 --> 04:30:43,039
taken by paul himself

6688
04:30:40,959 --> 04:30:45,039
i examined the computer program paul was

6689
04:30:43,040 --> 04:30:47,279
using to decode the alleged alien radio

6690
04:30:45,040 --> 04:30:48,800
transmissions and communications

6691
04:30:47,279 --> 04:30:50,399
and i had a lengthy discussion about

6692
04:30:48,799 --> 04:30:53,039
this matter with the late dr alan

6693
04:30:50,398 --> 04:30:56,158
heineck who is also who had also

6694
04:30:53,040 --> 04:30:57,920
independently examined paul's program i

6695
04:30:56,158 --> 04:31:00,879
spent considerable time discussing the

6696
04:30:57,920 --> 04:31:03,760
affair with both jim and carl lorenzon

6697
04:31:00,879 --> 04:31:05,599
both of whom were quite skeptical of it

6698
04:31:03,760 --> 04:31:07,279
and i have copies of many of the reports

6699
04:31:05,600 --> 04:31:08,880
and letters paul submitted the app road

6700
04:31:07,279 --> 04:31:11,840
beginning as far back as september of

6701
04:31:08,879 --> 04:31:11,839
1979.

6702
04:31:11,920 --> 04:31:16,158
moreover

6703
04:31:13,680 --> 04:31:18,398
as i have already stated

6704
04:31:16,158 --> 04:31:19,920
i was personally aware

6705
04:31:18,398 --> 04:31:22,840
of the intelligence community's

6706
04:31:19,920 --> 04:31:26,478
concerted efforts to systematically

6707
04:31:22,840 --> 04:31:28,398
confuse discourage and discredit paul

6708
04:31:26,478 --> 04:31:31,039
by providing him with a large body of

6709
04:31:28,398 --> 04:31:32,959
information on the subject of ufos

6710
04:31:31,040 --> 04:31:34,080
the malevolent aliens who allegedly

6711
04:31:32,959 --> 04:31:36,398
pilot them

6712
04:31:34,079 --> 04:31:38,238
the technology they employ and the

6713
04:31:36,398 --> 04:31:40,559
underground bases they supposedly

6714
04:31:38,238 --> 04:31:42,478
possess and occupy

6715
04:31:40,559 --> 04:31:44,478
the entire story

6716
04:31:42,478 --> 04:31:46,478
of a secret treaty between the u.s

6717
04:31:44,478 --> 04:31:49,039
government and the aliens

6718
04:31:46,478 --> 04:31:50,639
of exchanges of technology between us

6719
04:31:49,040 --> 04:31:52,640
and the aliens

6720
04:31:50,639 --> 04:31:54,079
of battles between aliens and american

6721
04:31:52,639 --> 04:31:56,158
armed forces

6722
04:31:54,079 --> 04:31:58,158
and of aliens allegedly having implanted

6723
04:31:56,158 --> 04:32:00,238
hundreds of thousands if not millions of

6724
04:31:58,158 --> 04:32:01,760
human beings for that for the purpose of

6725
04:32:00,238 --> 04:32:03,760
taking over the world

6726
04:32:01,760 --> 04:32:05,279
and using us as cattle

6727
04:32:03,760 --> 04:32:06,639
or slaves

6728
04:32:05,279 --> 04:32:09,120
came about

6729
04:32:06,639 --> 04:32:10,559
as a result of the disinformation

6730
04:32:09,120 --> 04:32:12,319
process

6731
04:32:10,559 --> 04:32:14,398
i know

6732
04:32:12,318 --> 04:32:17,119
because i was in a position to observe

6733
04:32:14,398 --> 04:32:19,278
much of this process as it unfolded

6734
04:32:17,120 --> 04:32:21,840
and i was providing

6735
04:32:19,279 --> 04:32:23,760
regular reports on its effectiveness to

6736
04:32:21,840 --> 04:32:25,680
some of the very people who were doing

6737
04:32:23,760 --> 04:32:29,199
it to paul

6738
04:32:25,680 --> 04:32:30,639
and i can tell you that it was effective

6739
04:32:29,199 --> 04:32:33,199
because i watched paul become

6740
04:32:30,639 --> 04:32:35,680
systematically more paranoid

6741
04:32:33,199 --> 04:32:37,279
and more emotionally unstable

6742
04:32:35,680 --> 04:32:39,439
as he tried to assimilate what was

6743
04:32:37,279 --> 04:32:41,279
happening to him

6744
04:32:39,439 --> 04:32:42,479
he had guns and knives all over his

6745
04:32:41,279 --> 04:32:44,238
house

6746
04:32:42,478 --> 04:32:45,438
he had installed extra locks on his

6747
04:32:44,238 --> 04:32:47,279
doors

6748
04:32:45,439 --> 04:32:49,439
and he swore that they

6749
04:32:47,279 --> 04:32:51,040
meaning the aliens were coming through

6750
04:32:49,439 --> 04:32:52,800
his walls at night and injecting him

6751
04:32:51,040 --> 04:32:56,000
with hideous chemicals which would knock

6752
04:32:52,799 --> 04:32:58,318
him out for long periods of time

6753
04:32:56,000 --> 04:33:00,398
he told me they had no id he had no idea

6754
04:32:58,318 --> 04:33:03,119
what they were doing with him after he

6755
04:33:00,398 --> 04:33:05,759
was knocked out he began to suffer

6756
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:07,279
increasing bouts of insomnia

6757
04:33:05,759 --> 04:33:08,798
others took over the day-to-day

6758
04:33:07,278 --> 04:33:10,560
operation of his business as he went

6759
04:33:08,798 --> 04:33:13,278
through this

6760
04:33:10,561 --> 04:33:16,080
one day i watched him eat not a bite of

6761
04:33:13,278 --> 04:33:19,438
his lunch while he chain smoked 28

6762
04:33:16,080 --> 04:33:21,680
cigarettes in 45 minutes

6763
04:33:19,438 --> 04:33:24,399
i knew at that time that he was not far

6764
04:33:21,680 --> 04:33:26,561
from an inevitable nervous collapse

6765
04:33:24,400 --> 04:33:28,561
his health deteriorated

6766
04:33:26,561 --> 04:33:31,039
he'd lost considerable weight

6767
04:33:28,561 --> 04:33:32,879
his hand shook as if from palsy and he

6768
04:33:31,039 --> 04:33:34,561
looked terrible

6769
04:33:32,879 --> 04:33:36,561
i tried to counsel him to drop the

6770
04:33:34,561 --> 04:33:38,719
entire ufo thing before his health was

6771
04:33:36,561 --> 04:33:40,319
completely destroyed

6772
04:33:38,719 --> 04:33:43,039
he said he knew things were getting bad

6773
04:33:40,319 --> 04:33:45,278
and he was trying to cope with it

6774
04:33:43,039 --> 04:33:47,279
not long afterward i heard he had been

6775
04:33:45,278 --> 04:33:49,198
hospitalized and was under psychiatric

6776
04:33:47,278 --> 04:33:51,680
care

6777
04:33:49,199 --> 04:33:53,520
whether ufos were actually ever involved

6778
04:33:51,680 --> 04:33:56,240
with all of this and to what extent i

6779
04:33:53,520 --> 04:33:56,240
never really knew

6780
04:33:56,400 --> 04:33:59,840
perhaps paul had merely stumbled upon

6781
04:33:58,400 --> 04:34:02,080
signals generated from some

6782
04:33:59,840 --> 04:34:03,759
sophisticated high-level government

6783
04:34:02,080 --> 04:34:06,561
project whose security people had hit

6784
04:34:03,759 --> 04:34:09,519
upon ufo-related disinformation as their

6785
04:34:06,561 --> 04:34:12,159
ultimate ultimate cover

6786
04:34:09,520 --> 04:34:13,920
or perhaps he had discovered a real

6787
04:34:12,159 --> 04:34:16,079
although somewhat less sensational

6788
04:34:13,919 --> 04:34:17,759
government ufo project

6789
04:34:16,080 --> 04:34:19,760
if that's possible

6790
04:34:17,759 --> 04:34:22,479
which elected to disinform him to

6791
04:34:19,759 --> 04:34:24,079
protect what they were really doing

6792
04:34:22,479 --> 04:34:26,399
i do know

6793
04:34:24,080 --> 04:34:28,000
from first-hand experience

6794
04:34:26,400 --> 04:34:30,959
that there was a tremendous amount of

6795
04:34:28,000 --> 04:34:32,719
government disinformation involved

6796
04:34:30,958 --> 04:34:34,399
and that a large proportion of what we

6797
04:34:32,719 --> 04:34:35,359
are hearing today about malevolent

6798
04:34:34,400 --> 04:34:37,439
aliens

6799
04:34:35,359 --> 04:34:38,958
underground bases secret treaties with

6800
04:34:37,438 --> 04:34:40,638
the us government

6801
04:34:38,958 --> 04:34:43,359
has its roots firmly planted in the

6802
04:34:40,638 --> 04:34:45,919
bennowitz affair

6803
04:34:43,359 --> 04:34:47,840
stories of an alleged ufo crash at aztec

6804
04:34:45,919 --> 04:34:49,118
new mexico are also a part of this

6805
04:34:47,840 --> 04:34:50,719
picture

6806
04:34:49,118 --> 04:34:53,278
but i'll save comment on that until

6807
04:34:50,719 --> 04:34:55,199
later in this paper

6808
04:34:53,278 --> 04:34:57,520
in any case

6809
04:34:55,199 --> 04:34:59,760
from what i knew of all of this

6810
04:34:57,520 --> 04:35:01,118
its purpose was strictly to discredit

6811
04:34:59,759 --> 04:35:03,519
benowitz

6812
04:35:01,118 --> 04:35:04,958
and nothing more

6813
04:35:03,520 --> 04:35:07,439
what amazes me

6814
04:35:04,958 --> 04:35:10,958
is that nearly a decade later these same

6815
04:35:07,438 --> 04:35:13,278
stories continue to circulate

6816
04:35:10,958 --> 04:35:15,199
recently one of the most prominent

6817
04:35:13,278 --> 04:35:17,118
figures in the current disinformation

6818
04:35:15,199 --> 04:35:18,400
wave which has been sweeping the ufo

6819
04:35:17,118 --> 04:35:21,359
community

6820
04:35:18,400 --> 04:35:23,520
was quoted as having stated that he

6821
04:35:21,359 --> 04:35:26,798
found paul benoit's information to be

6822
04:35:23,520 --> 04:35:28,479
one hundred percent true

6823
04:35:26,798 --> 04:35:30,399
this person spent a couple of days

6824
04:35:28,479 --> 04:35:32,560
talking to benowitz back in september in

6825
04:35:30,400 --> 04:35:35,520
the summer of 1987

6826
04:35:32,561 --> 04:35:37,680
and he has spent considerable time since

6827
04:35:35,520 --> 04:35:40,638
spreading elaborate and increasingly

6828
04:35:37,680 --> 04:35:42,561
sensationalistic stories based he claims

6829
04:35:40,638 --> 04:35:45,199
on information gathered from a variety

6830
04:35:42,561 --> 04:35:47,439
of unnamed sources

6831
04:35:45,199 --> 04:35:49,439
strip away the fluff

6832
04:35:47,438 --> 04:35:52,878
and what you have left is essentially

6833
04:35:49,438 --> 04:35:55,118
the benewit story all over again

6834
04:35:52,879 --> 04:35:57,119
there is no question in my mind that

6835
04:35:55,118 --> 04:35:58,878
it's mostly disinformation pure and

6836
04:35:57,118 --> 04:36:00,638
simple

6837
04:35:58,879 --> 04:36:03,279
and since i know

6838
04:36:00,638 --> 04:36:06,319
that connections exist

6839
04:36:03,278 --> 04:36:09,198
between those who are spreading it now

6840
04:36:06,319 --> 04:36:11,039
and those who were spreading it then

6841
04:36:09,199 --> 04:36:14,080
both from the benowitz angle and from

6842
04:36:11,039 --> 04:36:16,240
within the intelligence community

6843
04:36:14,080 --> 04:36:19,039
it seems reasonable to conclude

6844
04:36:16,240 --> 04:36:21,039
that those responsible for it

6845
04:36:19,039 --> 04:36:24,400
are not satisfied their task has been

6846
04:36:21,039 --> 04:36:26,159
completed even after all this time

6847
04:36:24,400 --> 04:36:28,159
knowing what is going on however is

6848
04:36:26,159 --> 04:36:32,000
simply not enough

6849
04:36:28,159 --> 04:36:34,000
the real question is why

6850
04:36:32,000 --> 04:36:36,000
was just that question i asked myself

6851
04:36:34,000 --> 04:36:39,039
when i first ran into the disinformation

6852
04:36:36,000 --> 04:36:41,359
operation that was being run on benowitz

6853
04:36:39,039 --> 04:36:45,119
it seemed to me at that time

6854
04:36:41,359 --> 04:36:46,798
that i was in a rather unique position

6855
04:36:45,118 --> 04:36:48,718
there i was

6856
04:36:46,798 --> 04:36:50,718
with my foot literally in the door of a

6857
04:36:48,719 --> 04:36:52,561
secret counter-intelligence game that

6858
04:36:50,719 --> 04:36:54,879
gave every appearance of being somehow

6859
04:36:52,561 --> 04:36:57,840
directly connected to a high-level

6860
04:36:54,879 --> 04:36:59,439
government ufo project

6861
04:36:57,840 --> 04:37:01,278
and judging by the positions of the

6862
04:36:59,438 --> 04:37:02,560
people i knew to be directly involved

6863
04:37:01,278 --> 04:37:04,239
with it

6864
04:37:02,561 --> 04:37:06,879
definitely had something to do with

6865
04:37:04,240 --> 04:37:08,320
national security

6866
04:37:06,879 --> 04:37:10,319
there was no way

6867
04:37:08,319 --> 04:37:12,000
i was going to allow the opportunity to

6868
04:37:10,319 --> 04:37:13,599
pass me by

6869
04:37:12,000 --> 04:37:16,719
without learning at least something

6870
04:37:13,599 --> 04:37:16,718
about what was going on

6871
04:37:18,080 --> 04:37:23,199
many ufologists have run up against this

6872
04:37:20,159 --> 04:37:25,118
information over the years

6873
04:37:23,199 --> 04:37:27,279
virtually all of them viewed it as a

6874
04:37:25,118 --> 04:37:29,680
negative process and backed away from it

6875
04:37:27,278 --> 04:37:31,038
either in anger or disgust

6876
04:37:29,680 --> 04:37:33,438
as soon as they discovered what they

6877
04:37:31,039 --> 04:37:35,119
were dealing with

6878
04:37:33,438 --> 04:37:37,519
even today

6879
04:37:35,118 --> 04:37:39,359
the ufo community unanimously considers

6880
04:37:37,520 --> 04:37:42,798
anyone known or suspected dealing in

6881
04:37:39,359 --> 04:37:44,638
disinformation to be one of the bad guys

6882
04:37:42,798 --> 04:37:47,278
someone to be shunned or avoided at all

6883
04:37:44,638 --> 04:37:49,359
costs and certainly never ever to be

6884
04:37:47,278 --> 04:37:51,118
believed

6885
04:37:49,359 --> 04:37:53,359
i on the other hand determined to take

6886
04:37:51,118 --> 04:37:56,560
quite a different tack

6887
04:37:53,359 --> 04:37:58,638
i would play the disinformation game

6888
04:37:56,561 --> 04:38:00,480
get my hands dirty just often enough to

6889
04:37:58,638 --> 04:38:02,638
lead those directing the process into

6890
04:38:00,479 --> 04:38:04,798
believing that i was doing exactly what

6891
04:38:02,638 --> 04:38:06,879
they wanted me to do

6892
04:38:04,798 --> 04:38:08,560
and all the while

6893
04:38:06,879 --> 04:38:10,240
continue to burrow my way into the

6894
04:38:08,561 --> 04:38:13,199
matrix so as to learn as much as

6895
04:38:10,240 --> 04:38:15,199
possible about who was directing it and

6896
04:38:13,199 --> 04:38:17,279
why

6897
04:38:15,199 --> 04:38:19,520
it would be a classic case

6898
04:38:17,278 --> 04:38:21,118
of turning the tables on the very ones

6899
04:38:19,520 --> 04:38:24,561
who were most confident that they had

6900
04:38:21,118 --> 04:38:26,638
the situation well in hand

6901
04:38:24,561 --> 04:38:28,879
there was just one thing i needed to do

6902
04:38:26,638 --> 04:38:30,399
this

6903
04:38:28,879 --> 04:38:33,680
secrecy

6904
04:38:30,400 --> 04:38:35,359
i couldn't tell anyone about what i was

6905
04:38:33,680 --> 04:38:36,719
doing

6906
04:38:35,359 --> 04:38:40,159
for if i did

6907
04:38:36,719 --> 04:38:42,080
and word got back to those in control

6908
04:38:40,159 --> 04:38:45,840
i would be immediately cut off and cast

6909
04:38:42,080 --> 04:38:45,840
adrift before i could learn anything

6910
04:38:46,000 --> 04:38:50,638
it was a formidable problem

6911
04:38:48,879 --> 04:38:52,400
some of the contacts i had made during

6912
04:38:50,638 --> 04:38:54,319
the benowitz affair seemed friendly and

6913
04:38:52,400 --> 04:38:56,080
professed a desire to end the ufo

6914
04:38:54,319 --> 04:38:58,000
cover-up and assist in getting

6915
04:38:56,080 --> 04:39:00,480
government information on ufos out to

6916
04:38:58,000 --> 04:39:03,759
the public in a slow and methodical

6917
04:39:00,479 --> 04:39:06,239
manner so as not to create panic

6918
04:39:03,759 --> 04:39:08,399
others seem more interested in obtaining

6919
04:39:06,240 --> 04:39:10,320
information from me

6920
04:39:08,400 --> 04:39:12,000
often on what other members of the ufo

6921
04:39:10,319 --> 04:39:13,759
community were doing

6922
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:16,319
and sometimes on other completely

6923
04:39:13,759 --> 04:39:18,159
unrelated subjects

6924
04:39:16,319 --> 04:39:20,479
whatever information i managed to get

6925
04:39:18,159 --> 04:39:22,400
from these individuals in return

6926
04:39:20,479 --> 04:39:24,079
usually came as a result of asking just

6927
04:39:22,400 --> 04:39:26,000
the right questions in just the right

6928
04:39:24,080 --> 04:39:28,480
ways

6929
04:39:26,000 --> 04:39:30,159
sometimes it took months or even years

6930
04:39:28,479 --> 04:39:32,879
of establishing a relationship with

6931
04:39:30,159 --> 04:39:35,919
someone before anyone useful came for

6932
04:39:32,879 --> 04:39:37,760
anything useful came from it

6933
04:39:35,919 --> 04:39:39,919
the most difficult difficult part of it

6934
04:39:37,759 --> 04:39:39,919
all

6935
04:39:40,000 --> 04:39:45,599
was trying to determine what was real

6936
04:39:42,560 --> 04:39:45,600
and what was

6937
04:39:45,759 --> 04:39:50,079
one of the key factors in any successful

6938
04:39:48,000 --> 04:39:52,797
disinformation scheme

6939
04:39:50,080 --> 04:39:56,240
is that it must contain some elements of

6940
04:39:52,797 --> 04:39:59,119
truth in order to make it credible

6941
04:39:56,240 --> 04:40:02,560
knowing that however is one thing

6942
04:39:59,119 --> 04:40:04,159
doing something with it is quite another

6943
04:40:02,560 --> 04:40:06,878
when you're dealing with what you know

6944
04:40:04,159 --> 04:40:08,560
to be a classified program

6945
04:40:06,878 --> 04:40:10,319
and you're determined to get information

6946
04:40:08,560 --> 04:40:12,479
without breaking any laws and running a

6947
04:40:10,319 --> 04:40:15,680
foul of national security

6948
04:40:12,479 --> 04:40:17,599
you're walking a very fine line

6949
04:40:15,680 --> 04:40:20,319
and that's why it takes a long time to

6950
04:40:17,599 --> 04:40:20,319
get results

6951
04:40:20,479 --> 04:40:24,878
in june of 1982

6952
04:40:22,957 --> 04:40:27,520
i approached my friend jamie chanderie

6953
04:40:24,878 --> 04:40:28,958
and brought him into the project

6954
04:40:27,520 --> 04:40:31,360
at that time

6955
04:40:28,957 --> 04:40:33,359
i also begin briefing stanton as to what

6956
04:40:31,360 --> 04:40:34,718
was going on

6957
04:40:33,360 --> 04:40:36,479
both of them knew

6958
04:40:34,718 --> 04:40:38,319
that i was in contact with a number of

6959
04:40:36,479 --> 04:40:40,797
people within the intelligence community

6960
04:40:38,319 --> 04:40:42,878
on the subject of ufos

6961
04:40:40,797 --> 04:40:44,717
and both were aware

6962
04:40:42,878 --> 04:40:47,600
that at least some of the information

6963
04:40:44,718 --> 04:40:49,520
coming through was disinformation

6964
04:40:47,599 --> 04:40:51,439
but both only had minimal knowledge of

6965
04:40:49,520 --> 04:40:54,718
the private goals and conclusions i had

6966
04:40:51,439 --> 04:40:56,797
established some months earlier

6967
04:40:54,718 --> 04:40:58,560
as the project progressed this actually

6968
04:40:56,797 --> 04:41:00,319
turned out to be more of an asset than a

6969
04:40:58,560 --> 04:41:02,240
drawback

6970
04:41:00,319 --> 04:41:03,919
indeed the three of us were an excellent

6971
04:41:02,240 --> 04:41:07,200
team in that we each approached the

6972
04:41:03,919 --> 04:41:07,199
problem from a different angle

6973
04:41:07,360 --> 04:41:11,119
from my point of view the process was

6974
04:41:09,119 --> 04:41:14,000
one of slowly and methodically burrowing

6975
04:41:11,119 --> 04:41:15,759
into a beehive from the outside with the

6976
04:41:14,000 --> 04:41:19,200
goal of ultimately reaching the queen

6977
04:41:15,759 --> 04:41:20,957
bee in the royal jelly at the center

6978
04:41:19,200 --> 04:41:22,718
since i never knew whether the other

6979
04:41:20,957 --> 04:41:24,717
bees i was certain to meet along the way

6980
04:41:22,718 --> 04:41:26,560
would be friendly or not

6981
04:41:24,718 --> 04:41:29,280
i had to proceed cautiously both in

6982
04:41:26,560 --> 04:41:31,040
order to avoid getting stung

6983
04:41:29,279 --> 04:41:33,680
and to learn as much as possible about

6984
04:41:31,040 --> 04:41:36,798
what what might lie ahead

6985
04:41:33,680 --> 04:41:38,718
the control factor as i saw it

6986
04:41:36,797 --> 04:41:40,878
rested largely with me and the way i

6987
04:41:38,718 --> 04:41:42,560
proceeded

6988
04:41:40,878 --> 04:41:45,040
jamie on the other hand saw it as a

6989
04:41:42,560 --> 04:41:46,798
somewhat different process

6990
04:41:45,040 --> 04:41:48,479
he too felt we were burrowing into a

6991
04:41:46,797 --> 04:41:50,399
beehive

6992
04:41:48,479 --> 04:41:52,079
but in his view of things our burrowing

6993
04:41:50,400 --> 04:41:54,480
was at the express invitation of the

6994
04:41:52,080 --> 04:41:56,718
queen bee herself

6995
04:41:54,479 --> 04:41:58,718
who clandestinely oversaw and encouraged

6996
04:41:56,718 --> 04:42:00,718
the process from a distance

6997
04:41:58,718 --> 04:42:02,637
as part of her private plan to get free

6998
04:42:00,718 --> 04:42:03,840
of politics that surrounds and restrains

6999
04:42:02,637 --> 04:42:05,759
her

7000
04:42:03,840 --> 04:42:08,718
as long as we followed the signposts

7001
04:42:05,759 --> 04:42:10,399
along the way jaime felt the learning

7002
04:42:08,718 --> 04:42:13,360
process would continue

7003
04:42:10,400 --> 04:42:15,200
and we could never get stung

7004
04:42:13,360 --> 04:42:17,200
stanton as the scientist of the group

7005
04:42:15,200 --> 04:42:18,637
was the one best qualified to conduct a

7006
04:42:17,200 --> 04:42:20,958
careful and organized search for

7007
04:42:18,637 --> 04:42:22,718
corroborating witnesses and evidence in

7008
04:42:20,957 --> 04:42:24,559
places outside of the loop jamie and i

7009
04:42:22,718 --> 04:42:27,200
were part of

7010
04:42:24,560 --> 04:42:28,958
and by the way

7011
04:42:27,200 --> 04:42:30,400
just as a matter of personal privilege

7012
04:42:28,957 --> 04:42:32,559
here

7013
04:42:30,400 --> 04:42:34,319
i would like to react to a nasty comment

7014
04:42:32,560 --> 04:42:36,080
about stanton which appeared in a recent

7015
04:42:34,319 --> 04:42:38,479
issue of jim mosley's saucer smear

7016
04:42:36,080 --> 04:42:40,160
newsletter

7017
04:42:38,479 --> 04:42:42,159
in this comment

7018
04:42:40,159 --> 04:42:45,200
the writer after first characterizing

7019
04:42:42,159 --> 04:42:46,718
stanton as a gullible individual

7020
04:42:45,200 --> 04:42:49,280
went on to wonder whether he could be

7021
04:42:46,718 --> 04:42:50,718
trusted to expose the mj-12 documents as

7022
04:42:49,279 --> 04:42:54,159
phony if his research turned up

7023
04:42:50,718 --> 04:42:56,240
conclusive evidence to that effect

7024
04:42:54,159 --> 04:42:57,840
it's a legitimate question

7025
04:42:56,240 --> 04:43:00,958
and i'd like to answer it by stating

7026
04:42:57,840 --> 04:43:02,878
that not only stanton but all of us

7027
04:43:00,957 --> 04:43:05,520
are firmly committed to releasing a full

7028
04:43:02,878 --> 04:43:06,878
and complete report on this matter

7029
04:43:05,520 --> 04:43:09,840
if evidence should come to light

7030
04:43:06,878 --> 04:43:13,520
suggesting that the documents are phony

7031
04:43:09,840 --> 04:43:15,520
you have my firm assurance

7032
04:43:13,520 --> 04:43:17,520
that it will most certainly be

7033
04:43:15,520 --> 04:43:18,878
included in the report

7034
04:43:17,520 --> 04:43:22,000
gullibility

7035
04:43:18,878 --> 04:43:25,760
is not an issue here

7036
04:43:22,000 --> 04:43:28,000
the matter is far larger than that

7037
04:43:25,759 --> 04:43:30,559
in any case stanton jamie and i are all

7038
04:43:28,000 --> 04:43:32,718
working towards the same goal

7039
04:43:30,560 --> 04:43:34,400
that of trying to discover what is truth

7040
04:43:32,718 --> 04:43:38,000
and what isn't

7041
04:43:34,400 --> 04:43:39,840
with respect to the government and ufos

7042
04:43:38,000 --> 04:43:41,599
my role in the benowitz affair had at

7043
04:43:39,840 --> 04:43:43,360
least secured me a seat in the right

7044
04:43:41,599 --> 04:43:44,479
theater

7045
04:43:43,360 --> 04:43:46,000
from there

7046
04:43:44,479 --> 04:43:48,079
it was only a question of whether i

7047
04:43:46,000 --> 04:43:49,599
could use my balcony ticket to discover

7048
04:43:48,080 --> 04:43:53,040
who owned the place and was making the

7049
04:43:49,599 --> 04:43:53,039
major operational decisions

7050
04:43:53,119 --> 04:43:57,360
both jamie and i felt that in order to

7051
04:43:54,878 --> 04:43:59,360
have any hope of success at all

7052
04:43:57,360 --> 04:44:02,400
we absolutely had to play the game

7053
04:43:59,360 --> 04:44:04,159
according to their rules

7054
04:44:02,400 --> 04:44:05,520
that meant doing everything possible to

7055
04:44:04,159 --> 04:44:07,919
give the appearance that we were

7056
04:44:05,520 --> 04:44:09,840
essentially useful idiots

7057
04:44:07,919 --> 04:44:11,519
who would cause no trouble while at the

7058
04:44:09,840 --> 04:44:13,680
same time playing the double game of

7059
04:44:11,520 --> 04:44:15,279
keeping our eyes and ears open in order

7060
04:44:13,680 --> 04:44:17,360
to learn as much as we could about what

7061
04:44:15,279 --> 04:44:19,119
was going on

7062
04:44:17,360 --> 04:44:21,040
in so doing

7063
04:44:19,119 --> 04:44:23,439
we were gradually able to expand our

7064
04:44:21,040 --> 04:44:24,878
base of friendly contact people

7065
04:44:23,439 --> 04:44:26,399
while working our way further and

7066
04:44:24,878 --> 04:44:28,797
further into the truly bizarre

7067
04:44:26,400 --> 04:44:31,520
intelligence labyrinth that surrounds

7068
04:44:28,797 --> 04:44:33,279
the subject of ufos

7069
04:44:31,520 --> 04:44:36,080
i have no problem in telling you that

7070
04:44:33,279 --> 04:44:38,637
it's been a tedious time and resource

7071
04:44:36,080 --> 04:44:40,958
consuming task which has been made all

7072
04:44:38,637 --> 04:44:43,439
the more difficult by the constant

7073
04:44:40,957 --> 04:44:45,119
barrage of rocks hoots and bottles

7074
04:44:43,439 --> 04:44:47,439
thrown in our direction from a segment

7075
04:44:45,119 --> 04:44:49,680
of the ufo community which out of

7076
04:44:47,439 --> 04:44:52,000
ignorance chose up to take on chose to

7077
04:44:49,680 --> 04:44:55,040
take up unfriendly and unsympathetic

7078
04:44:52,000 --> 04:44:56,560
positions toward us

7079
04:44:55,040 --> 04:44:58,400
were it not for the fact that we were

7080
04:44:56,560 --> 04:45:00,560
constantly challenged by the twists and

7081
04:44:58,400 --> 04:45:02,080
turns of our project and by the hope

7082
04:45:00,560 --> 04:45:04,240
that we could ultimately come away from

7083
04:45:02,080 --> 04:45:05,520
it with a smoking gun in hand i'm

7084
04:45:04,240 --> 04:45:08,240
convinced we would have thrown in the

7085
04:45:05,520 --> 04:45:09,760
towel a long time ago

7086
04:45:08,240 --> 04:45:11,440
indeed i must admit that there were

7087
04:45:09,759 --> 04:45:12,957
several occasions when we tried to do

7088
04:45:11,439 --> 04:45:14,797
just that

7089
04:45:12,957 --> 04:45:17,039
only to be encouraged to continue by

7090
04:45:14,797 --> 04:45:18,319
some of our friends from the inside who

7091
04:45:17,040 --> 04:45:22,080
had come to believe in what we were

7092
04:45:18,319 --> 04:45:24,159
doing and respected us for it

7093
04:45:22,080 --> 04:45:27,520
the anonymous arrival of the so-called

7094
04:45:24,159 --> 04:45:29,439
mj-12 documents in december of 1984 was

7095
04:45:27,520 --> 04:45:32,718
another factor we had to contend with in

7096
04:45:29,439 --> 04:45:34,797
this increasingly confusing web

7097
04:45:32,718 --> 04:45:38,718
the problem of their origin

7098
04:45:34,797 --> 04:45:39,919
and authenticity was and remains a major

7099
04:45:38,718 --> 04:45:42,000
issue

7100
04:45:39,919 --> 04:45:44,079
and on this point

7101
04:45:42,000 --> 04:45:47,279
our position of neutrality has

7102
04:45:44,080 --> 04:45:48,560
constantly been misinterpreted

7103
04:45:47,279 --> 04:45:50,717
therefore

7104
04:45:48,560 --> 04:45:53,360
for the record

7105
04:45:50,718 --> 04:45:55,040
it is important to point out here once

7106
04:45:53,360 --> 04:45:57,760
again

7107
04:45:55,040 --> 04:46:00,319
that at no time have either i or any of

7108
04:45:57,759 --> 04:46:03,679
my associates ever stated that these

7109
04:46:00,319 --> 04:46:05,840
documents are authentic

7110
04:46:03,680 --> 04:46:07,840
our position has consistently been that

7111
04:46:05,840 --> 04:46:09,279
we do not know whether they are

7112
04:46:07,840 --> 04:46:11,439
authentic

7113
04:46:09,279 --> 04:46:12,559
but that we as investigators remain

7114
04:46:11,439 --> 04:46:14,957
unaware

7115
04:46:12,560 --> 04:46:17,840
of any convincing evidence which would

7116
04:46:14,957 --> 04:46:19,520
suggest that they are not

7117
04:46:17,840 --> 04:46:21,520
that position remains essentially

7118
04:46:19,520 --> 04:46:23,040
unchanged today

7119
04:46:21,520 --> 04:46:25,279
and i'll have more to say about it when

7120
04:46:23,040 --> 04:46:27,680
i get to the end of this paper

7121
04:46:25,279 --> 04:46:30,079
the bottom line however

7122
04:46:27,680 --> 04:46:33,520
is that authentic or not

7123
04:46:30,080 --> 04:46:35,840
the story of the documents is a major

7124
04:46:33,520 --> 04:46:35,840
story

7125
04:46:36,400 --> 04:46:40,560
and one which is i've already assured

7126
04:46:38,080 --> 04:46:43,360
you will ultimately be told

7127
04:46:40,560 --> 04:46:45,200
when the time is ready to tell it

7128
04:46:43,360 --> 04:46:47,040
that process has already taken

7129
04:46:45,200 --> 04:46:48,878
considerably longer than i had thought

7130
04:46:47,040 --> 04:46:50,479
it would

7131
04:46:48,878 --> 04:46:52,560
i cannot predict when it will be

7132
04:46:50,479 --> 04:46:54,957
complete but i can say that progress has

7133
04:46:52,560 --> 04:46:56,798
been made

7134
04:46:54,957 --> 04:46:59,599
and i for one certainly hope it won't be

7135
04:46:56,797 --> 04:46:59,599
too much longer

7136
04:47:01,040 --> 04:47:04,638
for the many of you

7137
04:47:02,718 --> 04:47:06,798
who have roundly criticized our

7138
04:47:04,637 --> 04:47:08,878
methodology throughout the mj-12

7139
04:47:06,797 --> 04:47:10,079
controversy it seems important to note

7140
04:47:08,878 --> 04:47:12,159
here

7141
04:47:10,080 --> 04:47:14,798
that what you were witnessing

7142
04:47:12,159 --> 04:47:16,797
was the operation of a plan

7143
04:47:14,797 --> 04:47:19,520
to put out just enough of this bizarre

7144
04:47:16,797 --> 04:47:21,439
information to attract attention

7145
04:47:19,520 --> 04:47:23,200
and then carefully monitor who showed up

7146
04:47:21,439 --> 04:47:26,159
with questions to ask

7147
04:47:23,200 --> 04:47:28,000
or information to offer

7148
04:47:26,159 --> 04:47:29,759
once again

7149
04:47:28,000 --> 04:47:31,599
i was careful to state that i remained

7150
04:47:29,759 --> 04:47:33,840
unconvinced of the authenticity of the

7151
04:47:31,599 --> 04:47:35,680
information involved

7152
04:47:33,840 --> 04:47:38,080
in the case of the falcon and condor

7153
04:47:35,680 --> 04:47:40,080
interviews broadcast last october on ufo

7154
04:47:38,080 --> 04:47:42,480
coverup live

7155
04:47:40,080 --> 04:47:44,400
i'm convinced that at least some of that

7156
04:47:42,479 --> 04:47:46,797
information falls under the category of

7157
04:47:44,400 --> 04:47:49,200
disinformation

7158
04:47:46,797 --> 04:47:51,520
i'm equally convinced that some of it is

7159
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:54,637
true

7160
04:47:51,520 --> 04:47:56,560
the important point here is

7161
04:47:54,637 --> 04:47:58,878
that regardless of whether it is

7162
04:47:56,560 --> 04:48:00,240
disinformation or truth

7163
04:47:58,878 --> 04:48:03,040
it does

7164
04:48:00,240 --> 04:48:05,680
have to do with ufos

7165
04:48:03,040 --> 04:48:07,840
and the sources who provided it

7166
04:48:05,680 --> 04:48:10,000
felt that doing so was important enough

7167
04:48:07,840 --> 04:48:13,680
to risk going before national television

7168
04:48:10,000 --> 04:48:17,599
in order to accomplish that purpose

7169
04:48:13,680 --> 04:48:19,439
remember also that those sources knew

7170
04:48:17,599 --> 04:48:22,319
that falcon and condor would be

7171
04:48:19,439 --> 04:48:23,520
identified on the show as confidential

7172
04:48:22,319 --> 04:48:25,360
government

7173
04:48:23,520 --> 04:48:27,680
informants

7174
04:48:25,360 --> 04:48:29,680
the risk was all theirs

7175
04:48:27,680 --> 04:48:32,400
not out

7176
04:48:29,680 --> 04:48:34,080
and still they went ahead

7177
04:48:32,400 --> 04:48:36,400
just as they are currently going ahead

7178
04:48:34,080 --> 04:48:37,840
with the process of arranging a meeting

7179
04:48:36,400 --> 04:48:39,600
which will enable them to tell their

7180
04:48:37,840 --> 04:48:41,840
stories before one or more members of

7181
04:48:39,599 --> 04:48:41,840
congress

7182
04:48:42,240 --> 04:48:48,718
i submit to you

7183
04:48:44,479 --> 04:48:50,718
that such a process is extraordinary

7184
04:48:48,718 --> 04:48:53,440
regardless

7185
04:48:50,718 --> 04:48:55,280
of the truth or deception involved

7186
04:48:53,439 --> 04:48:57,039
and i think it's high time the ufo

7187
04:48:55,279 --> 04:49:00,797
community stopped throwing rocks at it

7188
04:48:57,040 --> 04:49:00,798
and began to consider the implications

7189
04:49:01,279 --> 04:49:06,239
one thing i can assure you

7190
04:49:04,159 --> 04:49:09,119
is that rocks are not

7191
04:49:06,240 --> 04:49:10,958
our project will continue

7192
04:49:09,119 --> 04:49:13,279
you can either become involved as others

7193
04:49:10,957 --> 04:49:16,479
in the ufo community have done

7194
04:49:13,279 --> 04:49:18,717
or you can sit back and wait for results

7195
04:49:16,479 --> 04:49:20,159
whatever those results good bad positive

7196
04:49:18,718 --> 04:49:22,878
or negative

7197
04:49:20,159 --> 04:49:24,797
you will hear about them

7198
04:49:22,878 --> 04:49:26,637
our trolling of the bait by means of a

7199
04:49:24,797 --> 04:49:28,479
progressive release of information and

7200
04:49:26,637 --> 04:49:30,479
ultimately by arranging for falcon and

7201
04:49:28,479 --> 04:49:31,599
condor to appear on the ufo cover-up

7202
04:49:30,479 --> 04:49:33,279
live show

7203
04:49:31,599 --> 04:49:35,759
produced a variety of interesting

7204
04:49:33,279 --> 04:49:37,840
results

7205
04:49:35,759 --> 04:49:39,840
shortly after the show

7206
04:49:37,840 --> 04:49:42,159
the fbi showed up and began asking

7207
04:49:39,840 --> 04:49:44,000
questions about it

7208
04:49:42,159 --> 04:49:45,520
they even arranged for a private showing

7209
04:49:44,000 --> 04:49:47,279
in the office of producer michael

7210
04:49:45,520 --> 04:49:49,200
seligman

7211
04:49:47,279 --> 04:49:50,878
agents on both east and west coasts

7212
04:49:49,200 --> 04:49:54,240
interviewed a number of ufologists and

7213
04:49:50,878 --> 04:49:55,840
other people including jamie chanderay

7214
04:49:54,240 --> 04:49:58,320
but although i let it be known that i'd

7215
04:49:55,840 --> 04:50:00,878
be more than happy to talk to them

7216
04:49:58,319 --> 04:50:02,400
they avoided me

7217
04:50:00,878 --> 04:50:04,000
this i found to be particularly

7218
04:50:02,400 --> 04:50:06,798
interesting in light of the fbi's

7219
04:50:04,000 --> 04:50:08,479
admission in response to a foyer request

7220
04:50:06,797 --> 04:50:10,479
that they have nearly 60 pages of

7221
04:50:08,479 --> 04:50:13,759
material on me that is all classified

7222
04:50:10,479 --> 04:50:16,718
for reasons of national security

7223
04:50:13,759 --> 04:50:18,637
that was in july of 1988

7224
04:50:16,718 --> 04:50:21,040
i still have no idea what those pages

7225
04:50:18,637 --> 04:50:23,119
contain

7226
04:50:21,040 --> 04:50:24,878
another thing that occurred as we had

7227
04:50:23,119 --> 04:50:26,637
hoped it would

7228
04:50:24,878 --> 04:50:28,080
was that a rather small number of people

7229
04:50:26,637 --> 04:50:29,759
came out of the woodwork claiming to

7230
04:50:28,080 --> 04:50:32,160
have inside knowledge of one type or

7231
04:50:29,759 --> 04:50:35,359
another about mj mj-12 or similar

7232
04:50:32,159 --> 04:50:37,439
government ufo projects

7233
04:50:35,360 --> 04:50:39,119
after weeding out the obvious cranks and

7234
04:50:37,439 --> 04:50:40,319
several others whose claims did not

7235
04:50:39,119 --> 04:50:42,479
check out

7236
04:50:40,319 --> 04:50:44,239
or whose or whose stories changed every

7237
04:50:42,479 --> 04:50:45,840
time they told them

7238
04:50:44,240 --> 04:50:47,840
we were left with a few leads which

7239
04:50:45,840 --> 04:50:49,759
seemed promising

7240
04:50:47,840 --> 04:50:51,200
it's premature to offer you a report on

7241
04:50:49,759 --> 04:50:54,319
these at this time

7242
04:50:51,200 --> 04:50:55,520
because we're still checking

7243
04:50:54,319 --> 04:50:57,599
also

7244
04:50:55,520 --> 04:51:00,159
seemingly in direct relationship to our

7245
04:50:57,599 --> 04:51:01,680
partial release of mj 12 material two

7246
04:51:00,159 --> 04:51:04,479
years ago

7247
04:51:01,680 --> 04:51:06,000
the flow of ufo related disinformation

7248
04:51:04,479 --> 04:51:08,637
has escalated

7249
04:51:06,000 --> 04:51:12,797
from a point of near insignificance

7250
04:51:08,637 --> 04:51:14,637
to what has become almost a flood tide

7251
04:51:12,797 --> 04:51:16,239
indeed many of you in the audience came

7252
04:51:14,637 --> 04:51:17,919
here tonight looking for answers to

7253
04:51:16,240 --> 04:51:20,240
questions related directly to that

7254
04:51:17,919 --> 04:51:20,239
problem

7255
04:51:20,319 --> 04:51:27,599
as i have taken great pains to point out

7256
04:51:24,797 --> 04:51:29,840
the current crop of disinformation is

7257
04:51:27,599 --> 04:51:31,599
really nothing new

7258
04:51:29,840 --> 04:51:34,957
it's just that a different crop of

7259
04:51:31,599 --> 04:51:38,000
people are spreading it this time around

7260
04:51:34,957 --> 04:51:39,919
i expect that those responsible

7261
04:51:38,000 --> 04:51:42,240
not the rumor mongers themselves but the

7262
04:51:39,919 --> 04:51:43,919
ones who are feeding them

7263
04:51:42,240 --> 04:51:46,240
thought it would work just as well this

7264
04:51:43,919 --> 04:51:48,319
time as it did last

7265
04:51:46,240 --> 04:51:49,440
the one thing i'm sure they didn't count

7266
04:51:48,319 --> 04:51:51,279
on

7267
04:51:49,439 --> 04:51:54,000
is that i would tell my story and thus

7268
04:51:51,279 --> 04:51:54,000
blow their cover

7269
04:51:54,479 --> 04:51:58,079
and speaking of blowing cover

7270
04:52:02,279 --> 04:52:09,000
[Music]

7271
04:52:04,560 --> 04:52:09,000
and speaking of blowing cover

7272
04:52:11,340 --> 04:52:14,478
[Music]

7273
04:52:15,840 --> 04:52:20,479
and speaking of blowing cover

7274
04:52:18,560 --> 04:52:22,560
i think it's high time that i tell you

7275
04:52:20,479 --> 04:52:24,319
what i know about another situation that

7276
04:52:22,560 --> 04:52:27,840
has found its way into the current crop

7277
04:52:24,319 --> 04:52:27,840
of ufo disinformation

7278
04:52:28,240 --> 04:52:32,400
i offer this not to embarrass the person

7279
04:52:30,400 --> 04:52:34,400
involved

7280
04:52:32,400 --> 04:52:36,718
but rather to shed light on an incident

7281
04:52:34,400 --> 04:52:38,958
which by the accounts of it

7282
04:52:36,718 --> 04:52:40,798
have appeared recently in a variety of

7283
04:52:38,957 --> 04:52:44,000
ufo newsletters

7284
04:52:40,797 --> 04:52:44,000
and at least one new book

7285
04:52:50,560 --> 04:52:55,520
aztec rumor

7286
04:52:53,680 --> 04:52:57,040
rick indicated he do nothing about the

7287
04:52:55,520 --> 04:52:58,560
matter

7288
04:52:57,040 --> 04:53:00,638
and asked me to tell him everything i

7289
04:52:58,560 --> 04:53:02,159
could

7290
04:53:00,637 --> 04:53:06,079
i did so

7291
04:53:02,159 --> 04:53:07,919
and as i recall he took some notes

7292
04:53:06,080 --> 04:53:09,600
we discussed a number of other things as

7293
04:53:07,919 --> 04:53:11,359
well

7294
04:53:09,599 --> 04:53:13,680
some months later

7295
04:53:11,360 --> 04:53:15,600
in early 1983

7296
04:53:13,680 --> 04:53:17,520
i became aware that rick was involved

7297
04:53:15,599 --> 04:53:19,279
with a team of several others

7298
04:53:17,520 --> 04:53:21,600
including one fellow from denver that i

7299
04:53:19,279 --> 04:53:23,759
knew of and at least one who was working

7300
04:53:21,599 --> 04:53:25,919
out of washington dc

7301
04:53:23,759 --> 04:53:26,957
in playing an elaborate disinformation

7302
04:53:25,919 --> 04:53:28,877
game

7303
04:53:26,957 --> 04:53:31,439
against a prominent cattle mutilation

7304
04:53:28,878 --> 04:53:33,040
researcher who at the time

7305
04:53:31,439 --> 04:53:34,877
had close connections with a major

7306
04:53:33,040 --> 04:53:38,400
television film company interested in

7307
04:53:34,878 --> 04:53:40,159
doing a ufo documentary

7308
04:53:38,400 --> 04:53:43,040
although i was not in a position to know

7309
04:53:40,159 --> 04:53:45,919
everything about what was going on

7310
04:53:43,040 --> 04:53:47,680
i had access to enough of it to conclude

7311
04:53:45,919 --> 04:53:49,439
that the government seemed hell-bent on

7312
04:53:47,680 --> 04:53:52,718
severing the ties that existed between

7313
04:53:49,439 --> 04:53:54,957
the researcher in the film company

7314
04:53:52,718 --> 04:53:56,637
my understanding was

7315
04:53:54,957 --> 04:53:58,797
that because the researcher was known to

7316
04:53:56,637 --> 04:54:00,479
have close ties to benowitz

7317
04:53:58,797 --> 04:54:03,119
and had exhibited a strong interest in

7318
04:54:00,479 --> 04:54:04,878
his work certain elements within the

7319
04:54:03,119 --> 04:54:06,878
intelligence community were concerned

7320
04:54:04,878 --> 04:54:08,958
that the story of his having intercepted

7321
04:54:06,878 --> 04:54:11,520
electromagnetic emissions

7322
04:54:08,957 --> 04:54:13,279
from the kirtland sandia area would end

7323
04:54:11,520 --> 04:54:15,439
up as part of the script of a feature

7324
04:54:13,279 --> 04:54:17,119
film

7325
04:54:15,439 --> 04:54:18,159
since this in turn might influence

7326
04:54:17,119 --> 04:54:20,079
others

7327
04:54:18,159 --> 04:54:21,680
possibly even the soviets

7328
04:54:20,080 --> 04:54:23,200
to obtain to attempt similar

7329
04:54:21,680 --> 04:54:24,637
interceptions

7330
04:54:23,200 --> 04:54:26,240
someone in a controlled position

7331
04:54:24,637 --> 04:54:29,039
apparently felt it had to be stopped

7332
04:54:26,240 --> 04:54:30,798
before it got out of hand

7333
04:54:29,040 --> 04:54:32,560
in any case the prime objective of the

7334
04:54:30,797 --> 04:54:35,840
counter-intelligence people who swarmed

7335
04:54:32,560 --> 04:54:37,120
around benowitz between 1980 and 84

7336
04:54:35,840 --> 04:54:39,200
seemed to be the maintenance of a

7337
04:54:37,119 --> 04:54:42,319
high-level security net around the radio

7338
04:54:39,200 --> 04:54:44,400
signals he was intercepting

7339
04:54:42,319 --> 04:54:46,718
i was unable to determine why this was a

7340
04:54:44,400 --> 04:54:50,000
priority at the time

7341
04:54:46,718 --> 04:54:51,680
and i still do not know today

7342
04:54:50,000 --> 04:54:53,200
what i do know however

7343
04:54:51,680 --> 04:54:54,797
is that since they couldn't physically

7344
04:54:53,200 --> 04:54:56,319
stop paul from intercepting these

7345
04:54:54,797 --> 04:54:58,159
signals

7346
04:54:56,319 --> 04:55:00,718
and since they hadn't been successful in

7347
04:54:58,159 --> 04:55:02,079
enlisting his voluntary silence

7348
04:55:00,718 --> 04:55:03,760
they fell back on a wall of

7349
04:55:02,080 --> 04:55:06,480
disinformation

7350
04:55:03,759 --> 04:55:08,319
as the best way to confuse the issue

7351
04:55:06,479 --> 04:55:10,479
and ultimately to call his credibility

7352
04:55:08,319 --> 04:55:12,878
into question

7353
04:55:10,479 --> 04:55:14,637
when the filmmaker appeared on the scene

7354
04:55:12,878 --> 04:55:16,637
and it looked as if paul's story might

7355
04:55:14,637 --> 04:55:18,399
become part of the script

7356
04:55:16,637 --> 04:55:20,399
the counterintelligence people simply

7357
04:55:18,400 --> 04:55:22,560
extended their disinformation activities

7358
04:55:20,400 --> 04:55:24,480
accordingly

7359
04:55:22,560 --> 04:55:26,240
part of this game involved a meeting

7360
04:55:24,479 --> 04:55:27,360
between the cattle mutilation researcher

7361
04:55:26,240 --> 04:55:29,040
in question

7362
04:55:27,360 --> 04:55:31,520
agent richard doty

7363
04:55:29,040 --> 04:55:33,680
and others at the afosi office of

7364
04:55:31,520 --> 04:55:35,279
kirkland air force base wherein the

7365
04:55:33,680 --> 04:55:37,040
researchers subsequently claim to have

7366
04:55:35,279 --> 04:55:38,797
been allowed to view certain purportedly

7367
04:55:37,040 --> 04:55:40,080
sensitive documents

7368
04:55:38,797 --> 04:55:43,279
about the government's alleged

7369
04:55:40,080 --> 04:55:44,798
involvement with ufos

7370
04:55:43,279 --> 04:55:46,957
part of this material included

7371
04:55:44,797 --> 04:55:49,840
information about an alleged ufo crash

7372
04:55:46,957 --> 04:55:51,439
retrieval at aztec

7373
04:55:49,840 --> 04:55:53,759
richard doty

7374
04:55:51,439 --> 04:55:55,520
who's bound by a security oath cannot

7375
04:55:53,759 --> 04:55:56,717
and i am told will not discuss this

7376
04:55:55,520 --> 04:55:58,560
matter

7377
04:55:56,718 --> 04:56:01,440
except to say that he broke no laws and

7378
04:55:58,560 --> 04:56:03,840
gave away no secrets that day

7379
04:56:01,439 --> 04:56:05,520
that in so far as i'm aware is entirely

7380
04:56:03,840 --> 04:56:07,840
correct

7381
04:56:05,520 --> 04:56:10,000
i on the other hand was never required

7382
04:56:07,840 --> 04:56:12,000
to sign a security oath

7383
04:56:10,000 --> 04:56:14,000
and therefore breaking no laws when i

7384
04:56:12,000 --> 04:56:15,919
tell you quite candidly

7385
04:56:14,000 --> 04:56:17,840
that the information which changed hands

7386
04:56:15,919 --> 04:56:20,159
on that day was directly descended from

7387
04:56:17,840 --> 04:56:22,637
the discussion doty and i had had only a

7388
04:56:20,159 --> 04:56:24,400
few months earlier

7389
04:56:22,637 --> 04:56:26,159
i can also tell you that it was a very

7390
04:56:24,400 --> 04:56:27,600
effective deception

7391
04:56:26,159 --> 04:56:30,000
because the researcher involved

7392
04:56:27,599 --> 04:56:31,519
continues to believe this information

7393
04:56:30,000 --> 04:56:33,759
and actively continues to try to

7394
04:56:31,520 --> 04:56:37,040
convince others of its truth even now

7395
04:56:33,759 --> 04:56:39,439
more than six years after the fact

7396
04:56:37,040 --> 04:56:40,878
unfortunately there was no ufo crash at

7397
04:56:39,439 --> 04:56:42,479
aztec

7398
04:56:40,878 --> 04:56:43,840
nor was there much truth to any of the

7399
04:56:42,479 --> 04:56:45,680
other materials applied to this

7400
04:56:43,840 --> 04:56:47,520
particular researcher

7401
04:56:45,680 --> 04:56:49,200
either at that meeting or during later

7402
04:56:47,520 --> 04:56:51,200
encounters

7403
04:56:49,200 --> 04:56:53,680
the much touted alien harvest is really

7404
04:56:51,200 --> 04:56:55,840
a dismal crop failure

7405
04:56:53,680 --> 04:56:57,520
to the best of my knowledge it was all

7406
04:56:55,840 --> 04:56:59,599
disinformation

7407
04:56:57,520 --> 04:57:01,600
and i was the unfortunate one who had

7408
04:56:59,599 --> 04:57:04,717
unwittingly supplied the fuel to those

7409
04:57:01,599 --> 04:57:06,717
who were spreading the fire i've held my

7410
04:57:04,718 --> 04:57:08,319
silence on this matter for more than six

7411
04:57:06,718 --> 04:57:11,360
years

7412
04:57:08,319 --> 04:57:11,360
now you know the truth

7413
04:57:11,759 --> 04:57:16,479
disinformation

7414
04:57:14,240 --> 04:57:18,320
disinformation is a strange and bizarre

7415
04:57:16,479 --> 04:57:20,159
game

7416
04:57:18,319 --> 04:57:22,319
those who play it are completely aware

7417
04:57:20,159 --> 04:57:25,119
that an operations success is dependent

7418
04:57:22,319 --> 04:57:26,479
upon dropping information upon a target

7419
04:57:25,119 --> 04:57:27,919
or mark

7420
04:57:26,479 --> 04:57:29,599
in such a way that the person will

7421
04:57:27,919 --> 04:57:31,519
accept it as truth

7422
04:57:29,599 --> 04:57:34,717
and will repeat and even defend it to

7423
04:57:31,520 --> 04:57:34,718
others as if it were true

7424
04:57:35,599 --> 04:57:39,840
once this has been accomplished

7425
04:57:38,319 --> 04:57:43,470
we certainly have a number of rude

7426
04:57:39,840 --> 04:57:46,159
people in this audience that's too bad

7427
04:57:43,470 --> 04:57:48,000
[Music]

7428
04:57:46,159 --> 04:57:49,919
once this has been accomplished the work

7429
04:57:48,000 --> 04:57:51,520
of the counter-intelligence specialist

7430
04:57:49,919 --> 04:57:53,039
is complete

7431
04:57:51,520 --> 04:57:54,479
they can simply withdraw in the

7432
04:57:53,040 --> 04:57:56,159
confidence that the dirty work of

7433
04:57:54,479 --> 04:57:58,560
spreading their poisoned seeds will be

7434
04:57:56,159 --> 04:58:00,079
done by others

7435
04:57:58,560 --> 04:58:03,280
those who want proof of how well the

7436
04:58:00,080 --> 04:58:05,520
process works need only look around you

7437
04:58:03,279 --> 04:58:08,079
every time one of you

7438
04:58:05,520 --> 04:58:10,240
repeats an unverified or unsubstantiated

7439
04:58:08,080 --> 04:58:11,840
bit of information without qualifying it

7440
04:58:10,240 --> 04:58:14,560
as such

7441
04:58:11,840 --> 04:58:16,400
you are contributing to that process and

7442
04:58:14,560 --> 04:58:18,319
every time you do it

7443
04:58:16,400 --> 04:58:19,760
somebody in a need to know position sits

7444
04:58:18,319 --> 04:58:21,840
back and has a horse laugh at your

7445
04:58:19,759 --> 04:58:24,079
expense

7446
04:58:21,840 --> 04:58:25,520
one final comment on the aztec hoax is

7447
04:58:24,080 --> 04:58:28,480
that two other individuals who

7448
04:58:25,520 --> 04:58:30,159
self-published a voluminous book ufo

7449
04:58:28,479 --> 04:58:33,119
crash at aztec

7450
04:58:30,159 --> 04:58:36,159
on the affair in 1987

7451
04:58:33,119 --> 04:58:38,559
chose to completely omit any any mention

7452
04:58:36,159 --> 04:58:40,000
of my extensive research on the case

7453
04:58:38,560 --> 04:58:41,600
which had been published two years

7454
04:58:40,000 --> 04:58:45,439
earlier

7455
04:58:41,599 --> 04:58:47,119
in which both researchers had copies of

7456
04:58:45,439 --> 04:58:49,359
it's a classic case of the book's

7457
04:58:47,119 --> 04:58:51,200
principal author having decided that his

7458
04:58:49,360 --> 04:58:52,319
conclusion with what his conclusion

7459
04:58:51,200 --> 04:58:54,080
would be

7460
04:58:52,319 --> 04:58:55,680
before even beginning the process of

7461
04:58:54,080 --> 04:58:57,040
investigating

7462
04:58:55,680 --> 04:58:59,279
and then ignoring everything which

7463
04:58:57,040 --> 04:59:01,120
didn't fit

7464
04:58:59,279 --> 04:59:03,119
one of the problems the ufology movement

7465
04:59:01,119 --> 04:59:04,637
has with its image

7466
04:59:03,119 --> 04:59:06,399
is that there are a significant number

7467
04:59:04,637 --> 04:59:07,919
of people involved with it

7468
04:59:06,400 --> 04:59:11,440
who not only support this sort of

7469
04:59:07,919 --> 04:59:15,279
journalism but encourage it

7470
04:59:11,439 --> 04:59:15,279
the next section of this presentation

7471
04:59:15,680 --> 04:59:20,797
will deal with questions and answers but

7472
04:59:17,599 --> 04:59:22,159
the format will be a bit different

7473
04:59:20,797 --> 04:59:24,319
in that i will

7474
04:59:22,159 --> 04:59:26,718
not take questions from the audience but

7475
04:59:24,319 --> 04:59:28,637
have elected to incorporate a number of

7476
04:59:26,718 --> 04:59:32,479
questions and their answers

7477
04:59:28,637 --> 04:59:32,479
directly into the body of this paper

7478
04:59:32,560 --> 04:59:38,000
question number one

7479
04:59:35,520 --> 04:59:40,159
am i currently involved with providing

7480
04:59:38,000 --> 04:59:42,080
information to any government agency

7481
04:59:40,159 --> 04:59:44,319
about ufos

7482
04:59:42,080 --> 04:59:46,000
or about people involved with the ufo

7483
04:59:44,319 --> 04:59:47,599
phenomena

7484
04:59:46,000 --> 04:59:48,637
answer

7485
04:59:47,599 --> 04:59:50,717
no

7486
04:59:48,637 --> 04:59:54,840
i have not had any such involvement

7487
04:59:50,718 --> 04:59:54,840
since nineteen eighty four

7488
05:00:01,560 --> 05:00:04,689
[Music]

7489
05:00:09,840 --> 05:00:13,759
frankly i'm a little ashamed

7490
05:00:12,159 --> 05:00:15,599
of some people in this audience

7491
05:00:13,759 --> 05:00:19,159
regardless of what you believe what you

7492
05:00:15,599 --> 05:00:19,159
hear or not

7493
05:00:28,637 --> 05:00:33,840
this is not a debate

7494
05:00:31,439 --> 05:00:37,199
it is a paper trying to be presented now

7495
05:00:33,840 --> 05:00:37,200
please show a little courtesy

7496
05:00:37,439 --> 05:00:39,759
thank you

7497
05:00:46,479 --> 05:00:49,840
i'll repeat that question

7498
05:00:50,000 --> 05:00:54,000
am i currently involved with providing

7499
05:00:52,000 --> 05:00:55,840
information to any government agency

7500
05:00:54,000 --> 05:00:57,840
about ufos

7501
05:00:55,840 --> 05:01:00,400
or about people involved with the ufo

7502
05:00:57,840 --> 05:01:00,400
phenomenon

7503
05:01:00,840 --> 05:01:03,680
answer

7504
05:01:02,400 --> 05:01:05,440
no

7505
05:01:03,680 --> 05:01:08,000
i have not had any such involvement

7506
05:01:05,439 --> 05:01:09,359
since 1984.

7507
05:01:08,000 --> 05:01:12,000
the extent

7508
05:01:09,360 --> 05:01:13,680
and the scope of that involvement

7509
05:01:12,000 --> 05:01:17,840
were essentially as i have already

7510
05:01:13,680 --> 05:01:17,840
outlined to you and nothing more

7511
05:01:18,319 --> 05:01:22,479
question two

7512
05:01:20,240 --> 05:01:24,320
am i presently involved in knowingly

7513
05:01:22,479 --> 05:01:27,279
spreading any sort of disinformation

7514
05:01:24,319 --> 05:01:27,279
about ufos

7515
05:01:28,080 --> 05:01:30,798
answer

7516
05:01:29,439 --> 05:01:32,957
no

7517
05:01:30,797 --> 05:01:34,637
the only conscious involvement i have

7518
05:01:32,957 --> 05:01:37,359
ever had

7519
05:01:34,637 --> 05:01:39,279
with a disinformation operation

7520
05:01:37,360 --> 05:01:43,560
was that which i have already outlined

7521
05:01:39,279 --> 05:01:43,559
in connection with the benowitz case

7522
05:01:44,319 --> 05:01:48,718
three

7523
05:01:45,840 --> 05:01:51,520
am i presently or have i ever been on

7524
05:01:48,718 --> 05:01:54,000
the payroll of any agency of the u.s

7525
05:01:51,520 --> 05:01:54,000
government

7526
05:01:54,319 --> 05:01:57,319
no

7527
05:01:58,000 --> 05:02:01,840
question four

7528
05:01:59,759 --> 05:02:05,759
what about my involvement

7529
05:02:01,840 --> 05:02:05,759
with ufo researcher lee graham

7530
05:02:06,878 --> 05:02:11,119
answer

7531
05:02:09,040 --> 05:02:13,280
earlier in this paper

7532
05:02:11,119 --> 05:02:15,439
i told you of how i was recruited to

7533
05:02:13,279 --> 05:02:18,159
supply information on mr benowitz in

7534
05:02:15,439 --> 05:02:21,599
1980

7535
05:02:18,159 --> 05:02:24,319
the exact wording in my statement was

7536
05:02:21,599 --> 05:02:27,039
benowitz and to a lesser extent several

7537
05:02:24,319 --> 05:02:28,957
other individuals

7538
05:02:27,040 --> 05:02:31,040
one of those other individuals was lee

7539
05:02:28,957 --> 05:02:35,199
graham

7540
05:02:31,040 --> 05:02:36,798
this began in 1983 if memory serves

7541
05:02:35,200 --> 05:02:39,119
it's important to note here that in

7542
05:02:36,797 --> 05:02:43,680
addition to being a ufo researcher lee

7543
05:02:39,119 --> 05:02:43,680
is also an avid military aircraft buff

7544
05:02:43,759 --> 05:02:48,399
as far as i'm aware

7545
05:02:46,797 --> 05:02:50,399
the counterintelligence people were

7546
05:02:48,400 --> 05:02:51,760
primarily interested in him because at

7547
05:02:50,400 --> 05:02:54,240
the time

7548
05:02:51,759 --> 05:02:56,797
lee was making a lot of inquiries and

7549
05:02:54,240 --> 05:02:58,718
collecting a great deal of information

7550
05:02:56,797 --> 05:03:01,840
on the then very highly classified

7551
05:02:58,718 --> 05:03:03,600
stealth aircraft program

7552
05:03:01,840 --> 05:03:05,279
apparently there was some question as to

7553
05:03:03,599 --> 05:03:08,479
why he was so interested in obtaining

7554
05:03:05,279 --> 05:03:09,840
information on so sensitive the subject

7555
05:03:08,479 --> 05:03:11,919
in other words

7556
05:03:09,840 --> 05:03:14,400
was he using it solely to satisfy a

7557
05:03:11,919 --> 05:03:16,159
personal curiosity

7558
05:03:14,400 --> 05:03:17,680
or was he passing it on to others who

7559
05:03:16,159 --> 05:03:19,279
perhaps had foreign intelligence

7560
05:03:17,680 --> 05:03:21,200
connections

7561
05:03:19,279 --> 05:03:24,559
there seemed to be only minimal interest

7562
05:03:21,200 --> 05:03:26,159
in his ufo activities

7563
05:03:24,560 --> 05:03:27,920
lee is a completely above board

7564
05:03:26,159 --> 05:03:30,878
individual

7565
05:03:27,919 --> 05:03:32,559
who is a loyal us citizen

7566
05:03:30,878 --> 05:03:34,958
in the process of keeping in touch with

7567
05:03:32,560 --> 05:03:36,638
him we became good friends

7568
05:03:34,957 --> 05:03:38,159
his knowledge of the fact that i had

7569
05:03:36,637 --> 05:03:39,919
friends in the intelligence community

7570
05:03:38,159 --> 05:03:41,439
gradually evolved into the firm belief

7571
05:03:39,919 --> 05:03:45,439
on his part

7572
05:03:41,439 --> 05:03:45,439
that i was much more than i really was

7573
05:03:45,520 --> 05:03:51,840
the id card story which has become the

7574
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:51,840
subject of so much speculation lately

7575
05:03:52,000 --> 05:03:57,360
stems from nothing more than a practical

7576
05:03:53,840 --> 05:03:58,878
joke which has simply gotten out of hand

7577
05:03:57,360 --> 05:04:00,718
since the story surrounding it is

7578
05:03:58,878 --> 05:04:01,840
somewhat longer than the time here will

7579
05:04:00,718 --> 05:04:04,400
allow

7580
05:04:01,840 --> 05:04:06,240
i will commit to publishing it later in

7581
05:04:04,400 --> 05:04:07,840
our newsletter so that it will be on

7582
05:04:06,240 --> 05:04:09,760
record for anyone interested in the

7583
05:04:07,840 --> 05:04:11,279
facts

7584
05:04:09,759 --> 05:04:14,877
the fact is

7585
05:04:11,279 --> 05:04:17,599
i do not hold a government id card

7586
05:04:14,878 --> 05:04:19,200
but think about it for just one moment

7587
05:04:17,599 --> 05:04:20,797
if i did

7588
05:04:19,200 --> 05:04:23,280
does it make sense that i'd pull it out

7589
05:04:20,797 --> 05:04:26,878
of my wallet and show it to lee graham

7590
05:04:23,279 --> 05:04:26,878
or anybody else for that matter

7591
05:04:28,479 --> 05:04:31,599
question five

7592
05:04:30,240 --> 05:04:33,600
is it true

7593
05:04:31,599 --> 05:04:35,199
that several hours of interviews with

7594
05:04:33,599 --> 05:04:36,717
the source code named falcon were

7595
05:04:35,200 --> 05:04:38,798
videotaped

7596
05:04:36,718 --> 05:04:41,280
some in the presence of voter bonafide

7597
05:04:38,797 --> 05:04:43,279
members of the news media

7598
05:04:41,279 --> 05:04:45,199
and is it true

7599
05:04:43,279 --> 05:04:47,199
as some have alleged

7600
05:04:45,200 --> 05:04:50,000
that those tapes were confiscated by the

7601
05:04:47,200 --> 05:04:50,000
u s government

7602
05:04:50,080 --> 05:04:53,680
answered

7603
05:04:51,520 --> 05:04:55,040
yes it is true that those tapes were

7604
05:04:53,680 --> 05:04:57,279
made

7605
05:04:55,040 --> 05:04:59,360
and no it is not true that they were

7606
05:04:57,279 --> 05:05:02,239
confiscated they are still

7607
05:04:59,360 --> 05:05:02,240
in our possession

7608
05:05:02,560 --> 05:05:06,400
question six

7609
05:05:04,560 --> 05:05:10,560
is it true that i've characterized the

7610
05:05:06,400 --> 05:05:10,560
cattle mutilation phenomenon as a hoax

7611
05:05:10,718 --> 05:05:14,400
answer

7612
05:05:11,919 --> 05:05:16,079
no

7613
05:05:14,400 --> 05:05:18,000
question 7

7614
05:05:16,080 --> 05:05:20,320
do i know anything about the so-called

7615
05:05:18,000 --> 05:05:22,240
ellsworth air force base humanoid case

7616
05:05:20,319 --> 05:05:26,000
of 1977

7617
05:05:22,240 --> 05:05:27,120
and the documents associated with it

7618
05:05:26,000 --> 05:05:28,718
answer

7619
05:05:27,119 --> 05:05:30,637
yes

7620
05:05:28,718 --> 05:05:32,319
some people have characterized this case

7621
05:05:30,637 --> 05:05:33,919
as a hoax while others have attributed

7622
05:05:32,319 --> 05:05:36,637
to attributed it to official

7623
05:05:33,919 --> 05:05:38,797
disinformation

7624
05:05:36,637 --> 05:05:42,079
it's my position that this was a special

7625
05:05:38,797 --> 05:05:44,239
counter intelligence training exercise

7626
05:05:42,080 --> 05:05:46,480
in the creation and dissemination of

7627
05:05:44,240 --> 05:05:47,840
disinformation

7628
05:05:46,479 --> 05:05:49,439
and yes

7629
05:05:47,840 --> 05:05:51,119
richard doty who was stationed at

7630
05:05:49,439 --> 05:05:53,279
ellsworth at the time

7631
05:05:51,119 --> 05:05:55,119
was clearly a part of it

7632
05:05:53,279 --> 05:05:56,797
but not in any capacity where he would

7633
05:05:55,119 --> 05:05:59,919
have been responsible for creating the

7634
05:05:56,797 --> 05:05:59,919
documents involved

7635
05:06:00,000 --> 05:06:03,840
question 8

7636
05:06:02,080 --> 05:06:06,638
do i know anything about the so-called

7637
05:06:03,840 --> 05:06:06,637
white soul letter

7638
05:06:07,200 --> 05:06:10,560
answer yes

7639
05:06:09,439 --> 05:06:12,559
the letter

7640
05:06:10,560 --> 05:06:14,319
which is loosely based upon an actual

7641
05:06:12,560 --> 05:06:16,798
ufo case

7642
05:06:14,319 --> 05:06:18,239
was written anonymously to apro in july

7643
05:06:16,797 --> 05:06:20,399
of 1980

7644
05:06:18,240 --> 05:06:22,159
by richard cody

7645
05:06:20,400 --> 05:06:24,000
is directly related to the benowitz

7646
05:06:22,159 --> 05:06:26,560
affair

7647
05:06:24,000 --> 05:06:29,119
essentially it was bait

7648
05:06:26,560 --> 05:06:32,000
afosi knew that benowitz had close ties

7649
05:06:29,119 --> 05:06:33,360
with the afro organization at the time

7650
05:06:32,000 --> 05:06:35,680
they were interested in recruiting

7651
05:06:33,360 --> 05:06:37,040
someone within the organization who

7652
05:06:35,680 --> 05:06:39,200
would be in a position to provide them

7653
05:06:37,040 --> 05:06:41,840
with feedback on benowitz's activities

7654
05:06:39,200 --> 05:06:45,280
and communications

7655
05:06:41,840 --> 05:06:46,957
since i was an april board member

7656
05:06:45,279 --> 05:06:48,637
the whites of letter was passed to me

7657
05:06:46,957 --> 05:06:50,239
for action shortly after it had been

7658
05:06:48,637 --> 05:06:52,000
received

7659
05:06:50,240 --> 05:06:54,080
it was not long thereafter that i came

7660
05:06:52,000 --> 05:06:55,360
to know richard doty

7661
05:06:54,080 --> 05:06:59,280
and began to provide him with

7662
05:06:55,360 --> 05:07:02,080
information about benowitz in his case

7663
05:06:59,279 --> 05:07:02,079
question nine

7664
05:07:02,319 --> 05:07:06,079
what do i know about the so-called

7665
05:07:04,000 --> 05:07:07,637
aquarius document which purports to be a

7666
05:07:06,080 --> 05:07:10,080
facsimile

7667
05:07:07,637 --> 05:07:13,279
afossi message

7668
05:07:10,080 --> 05:07:14,958
with a few spurious additions

7669
05:07:13,279 --> 05:07:17,439
i neither typed

7670
05:07:14,957 --> 05:07:21,039
nor retyped this document

7671
05:07:17,439 --> 05:07:23,039
it was created by afosi or at least i

7672
05:07:21,040 --> 05:07:26,718
always assumed it was

7673
05:07:23,040 --> 05:07:28,400
and it was handed to me in february 1981

7674
05:07:26,718 --> 05:07:30,400
with the intention that i would pass it

7675
05:07:28,400 --> 05:07:32,400
to benowitz

7676
05:07:30,400 --> 05:07:34,480
my understanding although i never knew

7677
05:07:32,400 --> 05:07:36,319
for sure

7678
05:07:34,479 --> 05:07:38,000
was that benowitz was expected to wave

7679
05:07:36,319 --> 05:07:39,439
it to the press and others as proof of

7680
05:07:38,000 --> 05:07:40,878
what he was saying about an alien

7681
05:07:39,439 --> 05:07:42,717
invasion

7682
05:07:40,878 --> 05:07:44,718
at which point the document would be not

7683
05:07:42,718 --> 05:07:45,920
denounced as a counterfeit

7684
05:07:44,718 --> 05:07:47,840
and benowitz would be further

7685
05:07:45,919 --> 05:07:49,519
discredited

7686
05:07:47,840 --> 05:07:50,319
unfortunately

7687
05:07:49,520 --> 05:07:52,400
or

7688
05:07:50,319 --> 05:07:54,079
perhaps fortunately depending upon one's

7689
05:07:52,400 --> 05:07:56,958
point of view

7690
05:07:54,080 --> 05:07:59,360
it didn't turn out that way

7691
05:07:56,957 --> 05:08:01,199
a highlighted version of this document

7692
05:07:59,360 --> 05:08:03,119
showing the real information and the

7693
05:08:01,200 --> 05:08:04,878
added information appears in the current

7694
05:08:03,119 --> 05:08:06,559
issue of our newsletter

7695
05:08:04,878 --> 05:08:08,319
which will be available at our table off

7696
05:08:06,560 --> 05:08:10,878
in the lobby

7697
05:08:08,319 --> 05:08:12,000
i might also add the entire text of this

7698
05:08:10,878 --> 05:08:14,240
speech

7699
05:08:12,000 --> 05:08:16,240
is also in there

7700
05:08:14,240 --> 05:08:17,600
one additional bit of information about

7701
05:08:16,240 --> 05:08:19,200
this document

7702
05:08:17,599 --> 05:08:21,680
is the way that it came to be known to

7703
05:08:19,200 --> 05:08:24,080
the ufo community

7704
05:08:21,680 --> 05:08:26,000
in september of 1982

7705
05:08:24,080 --> 05:08:27,600
insofar as i was aware there were only

7706
05:08:26,000 --> 05:08:29,360
three copies of this document in

7707
05:08:27,599 --> 05:08:32,479
existence

7708
05:08:29,360 --> 05:08:34,637
one of these i had given to benowitz

7709
05:08:32,479 --> 05:08:36,718
the second was in safekeeping

7710
05:08:34,637 --> 05:08:40,239
and a third was in my briefcase during a

7711
05:08:36,718 --> 05:08:41,840
trip which i had made to san francisco

7712
05:08:40,240 --> 05:08:43,520
while there

7713
05:08:41,840 --> 05:08:45,200
i had a morning meeting with a man who

7714
05:08:43,520 --> 05:08:47,760
turned out later to be an associate of

7715
05:08:45,200 --> 05:08:49,680
ufologist peter gersten

7716
05:08:47,759 --> 05:08:51,599
that same afternoon

7717
05:08:49,680 --> 05:08:53,920
my car was broken into

7718
05:08:51,599 --> 05:08:55,840
and the briefcase was stolen

7719
05:08:53,919 --> 05:08:58,717
there is a police report by the way on

7720
05:08:55,840 --> 05:09:00,718
file in san francisco four months later

7721
05:08:58,718 --> 05:09:03,040
a copy of that same document complete

7722
05:09:00,718 --> 05:09:04,479
with annotations i had penciled on it

7723
05:09:03,040 --> 05:09:06,798
turned up in the hands of none other

7724
05:09:04,479 --> 05:09:09,040
than gersten himself

7725
05:09:06,797 --> 05:09:10,878
to this day i have never received a

7726
05:09:09,040 --> 05:09:13,600
satisfactory explanation of how he

7727
05:09:10,878 --> 05:09:15,680
obtained it

7728
05:09:13,599 --> 05:09:18,319
question 10

7729
05:09:15,680 --> 05:09:20,560
what about the afosi documents which

7730
05:09:18,319 --> 05:09:22,718
speak of a 1980

7731
05:09:20,560 --> 05:09:24,798
ufo landing near a nuclear storage

7732
05:09:22,718 --> 05:09:27,040
facility within the kirtland air force

7733
05:09:24,797 --> 05:09:29,599
base complex

7734
05:09:27,040 --> 05:09:32,560
are these documents more disinformation

7735
05:09:29,599 --> 05:09:34,877
or are they authentic

7736
05:09:32,560 --> 05:09:37,840
answer to the best of my knowledge

7737
05:09:34,878 --> 05:09:37,840
they are authentic

7738
05:09:38,479 --> 05:09:43,040
question 11. what about other documents

7739
05:09:41,360 --> 05:09:44,560
which i've either alluded to having or

7740
05:09:43,040 --> 05:09:47,920
have published portions of without

7741
05:09:44,560 --> 05:09:47,920
providing further details

7742
05:09:48,797 --> 05:09:52,878
answer

7743
05:09:50,957 --> 05:09:55,919
there are a number of these and they

7744
05:09:52,878 --> 05:09:57,440
came to us in several different ways

7745
05:09:55,919 --> 05:09:59,359
none of them however seemed to have any

7746
05:09:57,439 --> 05:10:01,119
direct connection to the benowit's case

7747
05:09:59,360 --> 05:10:03,440
nor as far as i can tell was richard

7748
05:10:01,119 --> 05:10:05,119
dodie directly involved in supplying

7749
05:10:03,439 --> 05:10:06,559
them to us

7750
05:10:05,119 --> 05:10:08,079
whether they are legitimate or

7751
05:10:06,560 --> 05:10:10,240
disinformation

7752
05:10:08,080 --> 05:10:12,958
but more likely a combination of both is

7753
05:10:10,240 --> 05:10:14,560
still a matter of question

7754
05:10:12,957 --> 05:10:16,399
once we have completed our study of

7755
05:10:14,560 --> 05:10:19,280
these materials

7756
05:10:16,400 --> 05:10:21,440
we will make them available as well

7757
05:10:19,279 --> 05:10:23,759
our publication of expregated copies of

7758
05:10:21,439 --> 05:10:25,279
some of this material also served a

7759
05:10:23,759 --> 05:10:28,559
definite purpose

7760
05:10:25,279 --> 05:10:28,559
but that's another story

7761
05:10:29,040 --> 05:10:32,080
question number 12

7762
05:10:32,240 --> 05:10:36,400
ufo basher phil class has been the topic

7763
05:10:34,797 --> 05:10:37,840
of a number of rumors lately to the

7764
05:10:36,400 --> 05:10:39,760
effect that he's an active government

7765
05:10:37,840 --> 05:10:42,957
disinformation agent

7766
05:10:39,759 --> 05:10:42,957
what do i think about that

7767
05:10:43,119 --> 05:10:47,840
answer

7768
05:10:44,718 --> 05:10:49,760
mr class is a very distinct individual

7769
05:10:47,840 --> 05:10:51,920
who has long been a close follower of my

7770
05:10:49,759 --> 05:10:54,159
activities

7771
05:10:51,919 --> 05:10:56,479
indeed i believe he was the only one out

7772
05:10:54,159 --> 05:10:58,400
of the entire ufo community

7773
05:10:56,479 --> 05:11:00,560
who managed to figure out what i and my

7774
05:10:58,400 --> 05:11:03,200
associates were up to

7775
05:11:00,560 --> 05:11:04,718
and it horrified him

7776
05:11:03,200 --> 05:11:06,718
in my opinion

7777
05:11:04,718 --> 05:11:08,240
the very idea that someone might

7778
05:11:06,718 --> 05:11:10,479
actually be capable of getting far

7779
05:11:08,240 --> 05:11:12,240
enough into the ufo problem to unmask

7780
05:11:10,479 --> 05:11:14,000
his debunking claims

7781
05:11:12,240 --> 05:11:16,320
constituted a personal threat to him

7782
05:11:14,000 --> 05:11:17,759
that had to be dealt with

7783
05:11:16,319 --> 05:11:19,439
he has been obsessed with doing

7784
05:11:17,759 --> 05:11:22,717
everything possible to try to either

7785
05:11:19,439 --> 05:11:24,559
stop or discredit us ever since

7786
05:11:22,718 --> 05:11:25,840
the handout he passed around today to

7787
05:11:24,560 --> 05:11:29,040
many of you

7788
05:11:25,840 --> 05:11:31,439
is just another example of it

7789
05:11:29,040 --> 05:11:33,760
as to his motives i think it's best left

7790
05:11:31,439 --> 05:11:35,919
to mr class to explain why he behaves as

7791
05:11:33,759 --> 05:11:38,239
he does

7792
05:11:35,919 --> 05:11:39,839
perhaps phil bash's ufos and the people

7793
05:11:38,240 --> 05:11:43,140
who see them for the same reason that

7794
05:11:39,840 --> 05:11:44,957
other people tear the wings off of flies

7795
05:11:43,139 --> 05:11:46,878
[Music]

7796
05:11:44,957 --> 05:11:49,119
or perhaps he gets well paid to do what

7797
05:11:46,878 --> 05:11:51,279
he does

7798
05:11:49,119 --> 05:11:53,439
if there's nothing to ufos as he's

7799
05:11:51,279 --> 05:11:55,199
consistently claimed

7800
05:11:53,439 --> 05:11:57,680
then i can't imagine why he gets so

7801
05:11:55,200 --> 05:12:01,159
emotional about them

7802
05:11:57,680 --> 05:12:01,159
unless of course

7803
05:12:04,080 --> 05:12:08,080
unless of course it's all part of the

7804
05:12:05,680 --> 05:12:08,080
script

7805
05:12:08,400 --> 05:12:12,878
phil's been bashing ufos for over 20

7806
05:12:10,637 --> 05:12:14,797
years now

7807
05:12:12,878 --> 05:12:17,040
in that process he's always been very

7808
05:12:14,797 --> 05:12:18,797
quick to ascribe ulterior motives to the

7809
05:12:17,040 --> 05:12:20,958
people who report them and investigate

7810
05:12:18,797 --> 05:12:22,479
them

7811
05:12:20,957 --> 05:12:24,079
a lot of people in this audience would

7812
05:12:22,479 --> 05:12:26,957
be very interested in hearing what his

7813
05:12:24,080 --> 05:12:31,440
ulterior motives are

7814
05:12:26,957 --> 05:12:33,199
why does mr clash class bash ufos

7815
05:12:31,439 --> 05:12:34,717
i for one would welcome a rational

7816
05:12:33,200 --> 05:12:36,718
explanation of just why a man would

7817
05:12:34,718 --> 05:12:38,560
devote 20 years of his life to an

7818
05:12:36,718 --> 05:12:40,840
essentially one-man crusade against

7819
05:12:38,560 --> 05:12:42,560
something which he claims doesn't

7820
05:12:40,840 --> 05:12:45,759
exist

7821
05:12:42,560 --> 05:12:47,520
if he's not spreading this information

7822
05:12:45,759 --> 05:12:49,279
if he's not on some government or

7823
05:12:47,520 --> 05:12:51,600
private payroll

7824
05:12:49,279 --> 05:12:54,840
then just what is he up to and precisely

7825
05:12:51,599 --> 05:12:57,359
what does he hope to accomplish by

7826
05:12:54,840 --> 05:13:00,957
it about it folks how many of you would

7827
05:12:57,360 --> 05:13:00,958
like to hear what makes class tick

7828
05:13:03,540 --> 05:13:06,689
[Applause]

7829
05:13:08,400 --> 05:13:12,400
i think he owes us all an explanation of

7830
05:13:10,560 --> 05:13:13,920
what in my opinion and i'm sure in that

7831
05:13:12,400 --> 05:13:17,040
of many others here

7832
05:13:13,919 --> 05:13:20,559
has been 20 long years

7833
05:13:17,040 --> 05:13:20,560
of unprofessional attitude

7834
05:13:20,718 --> 05:13:25,040
as a matter of fact i think he owes a

7835
05:13:22,400 --> 05:13:28,080
lot of people an apology

7836
05:13:25,040 --> 05:13:28,080
myself included

7837
05:13:33,520 --> 05:13:36,479
pages of my newsletter are open to you

7838
05:13:35,520 --> 05:13:37,920
phil

7839
05:13:36,479 --> 05:13:39,119
whenever you're ready to explain

7840
05:13:37,919 --> 05:13:42,637
yourself

7841
05:13:39,119 --> 05:13:42,637
we'll be more than happy to print it

7842
05:13:43,119 --> 05:13:46,479
and now having gotten that out of the

7843
05:13:44,637 --> 05:13:48,239
way

7844
05:13:46,479 --> 05:13:49,680
this seems to be an appropriate place to

7845
05:13:48,240 --> 05:13:53,040
tell you the story of man's first

7846
05:13:49,680 --> 05:13:54,797
contact with the martians

7847
05:13:53,040 --> 05:13:57,600
during a worldwide telecast of the

7848
05:13:54,797 --> 05:14:01,039
martian ambassador's press conference

7849
05:13:57,599 --> 05:14:02,559
the following dialogue transpired

7850
05:14:01,040 --> 05:14:04,878
reporter

7851
05:14:02,560 --> 05:14:06,400
tell me mr martian

7852
05:14:04,878 --> 05:14:09,200
what sort of social structure do you

7853
05:14:06,400 --> 05:14:09,200
have on mars

7854
05:14:09,520 --> 05:14:12,878
martian

7855
05:14:11,119 --> 05:14:14,718
well we're um we're all devout

7856
05:14:12,878 --> 05:14:16,400
communists

7857
05:14:14,718 --> 05:14:18,240
there are no cares or worries in our

7858
05:14:16,400 --> 05:14:21,920
society

7859
05:14:18,240 --> 05:14:24,320
and we are all extremely happy

7860
05:14:21,919 --> 05:14:25,359
reporter

7861
05:14:24,319 --> 05:14:26,797
well

7862
05:14:25,360 --> 05:14:30,479
what's the one thing about living on

7863
05:14:26,797 --> 05:14:30,479
mars that makes your people the happiest

7864
05:14:30,797 --> 05:14:34,319
martian

7865
05:14:31,919 --> 05:14:36,399
well that's a very easy question you see

7866
05:14:34,319 --> 05:14:38,797
unlike the people on earth

7867
05:14:36,400 --> 05:14:41,440
we on mars enjoy the distinct advantage

7868
05:14:38,797 --> 05:14:45,399
of living in a completely

7869
05:14:41,439 --> 05:14:45,399
classless society

7870
05:14:52,637 --> 05:14:58,159
so moving from the humerus back to the

7871
05:14:54,479 --> 05:14:59,840
serious here's question 13.

7872
05:14:58,159 --> 05:15:03,840
what do i think of whitley strieber and

7873
05:14:59,840 --> 05:15:03,840
his claims of being a ufo abductee

7874
05:15:04,479 --> 05:15:07,919
answered

7875
05:15:05,439 --> 05:15:09,520
at first i was highly skeptical

7876
05:15:07,919 --> 05:15:11,439
and admittedly somewhat jealous of

7877
05:15:09,520 --> 05:15:13,279
whitley

7878
05:15:11,439 --> 05:15:14,877
as a result i undertook to get to know

7879
05:15:13,279 --> 05:15:17,039
the man in order to assess things for

7880
05:15:14,878 --> 05:15:19,680
myself

7881
05:15:17,040 --> 05:15:21,360
in that process he's earned my respect

7882
05:15:19,680 --> 05:15:23,840
my admiration

7883
05:15:21,360 --> 05:15:25,680
and my friendship

7884
05:15:23,840 --> 05:15:27,439
whitley has come very close to the truth

7885
05:15:25,680 --> 05:15:30,400
in a number of ways and although still

7886
05:15:27,439 --> 05:15:32,159
somewhat baffled by his own experiences

7887
05:15:30,400 --> 05:15:35,200
he's found a very acceptable way of

7888
05:15:32,159 --> 05:15:36,797
accommodating them into his life

7889
05:15:35,200 --> 05:15:39,600
if one makes a conscious effort to

7890
05:15:36,797 --> 05:15:40,957
remove whitley's emotional reactions

7891
05:15:39,599 --> 05:15:43,680
and then takes a hard look at the

7892
05:15:40,957 --> 05:15:46,079
remaining core of information

7893
05:15:43,680 --> 05:15:47,760
the result is an insightful look into

7894
05:15:46,080 --> 05:15:49,840
what gives every appearance of being a

7895
05:15:47,759 --> 05:15:51,279
real situation

7896
05:15:49,840 --> 05:15:53,200
in any event

7897
05:15:51,279 --> 05:15:54,637
i certainly wouldn't dismiss this man

7898
05:15:53,200 --> 05:15:56,319
too lightly

7899
05:15:54,637 --> 05:15:58,957
we're going to hear a lot more from him

7900
05:15:56,319 --> 05:16:01,840
before it's all over

7901
05:15:58,957 --> 05:16:04,079
question 14.

7902
05:16:01,840 --> 05:16:05,920
jerome clark reported in fate magazine

7903
05:16:04,080 --> 05:16:08,160
that i and jamie chanduray made a trip

7904
05:16:05,919 --> 05:16:10,239
to washington dc

7905
05:16:08,159 --> 05:16:12,560
in anticipation of meeting a live alien

7906
05:16:10,240 --> 05:16:14,159
and were stood up in the process

7907
05:16:12,560 --> 05:16:16,080
doesn't this imply that we were highly

7908
05:16:14,159 --> 05:16:17,759
gullible individuals

7909
05:16:16,080 --> 05:16:19,120
that the experience was probably just a

7910
05:16:17,759 --> 05:16:22,319
practical joke on the part of the

7911
05:16:19,119 --> 05:16:22,319
disinformation crowd

7912
05:16:22,400 --> 05:16:24,840
answered

7913
05:16:23,439 --> 05:16:28,079
not at

7914
05:16:24,840 --> 05:16:29,840
all if you stop to think about it

7915
05:16:28,080 --> 05:16:32,000
considering what you now know of our

7916
05:16:29,840 --> 05:16:35,279
project and its goals

7917
05:16:32,000 --> 05:16:36,797
we had a story no matter what happened

7918
05:16:35,279 --> 05:16:39,439
we made the trip because we simply

7919
05:16:36,797 --> 05:16:40,957
couldn't lose

7920
05:16:39,439 --> 05:16:43,840
but then there's more to that experience

7921
05:16:40,957 --> 05:16:43,840
than you know about

7922
05:16:44,878 --> 05:16:48,560
once again let me caution the hasty

7923
05:16:46,637 --> 05:16:51,759
pudding crowd not to jump to conclusions

7924
05:16:48,560 --> 05:16:51,760
until all the facts are in

7925
05:16:51,840 --> 05:16:54,637
question

7926
05:16:52,840 --> 05:16:58,159
15.

7927
05:16:54,637 --> 05:16:58,159
what are my plans for the future

7928
05:16:58,560 --> 05:17:02,479
answer

7929
05:17:00,560 --> 05:17:04,159
i and my associates will continue our

7930
05:17:02,479 --> 05:17:06,840
work and will continue to keep you

7931
05:17:04,159 --> 05:17:09,119
informed of our results as circumstances

7932
05:17:06,840 --> 05:17:13,200
warned what you've heard today is only

7933
05:17:09,119 --> 05:17:13,200
part of a larger body of information

7934
05:17:13,759 --> 05:17:17,599
question 16

7935
05:17:16,159 --> 05:17:19,439
assuming they're interested what can

7936
05:17:17,599 --> 05:17:22,239
fellow ufologists do to support our

7937
05:17:19,439 --> 05:17:23,840
continuing efforts

7938
05:17:22,240 --> 05:17:25,840
answered

7939
05:17:23,840 --> 05:17:27,439
first of all what we're doing takes a

7940
05:17:25,840 --> 05:17:29,920
lot of time

7941
05:17:27,439 --> 05:17:31,840
and a lot of money

7942
05:17:29,919 --> 05:17:34,239
we have the time

7943
05:17:31,840 --> 05:17:36,400
money's not always available

7944
05:17:34,240 --> 05:17:38,638
the easiest thing you can do is to make

7945
05:17:36,400 --> 05:17:41,200
some contribution to the effort

7946
05:17:38,637 --> 05:17:43,119
if not in cash which by no means do we

7947
05:17:41,200 --> 05:17:45,119
request

7948
05:17:43,119 --> 05:17:46,797
you might want to offer time

7949
05:17:45,119 --> 05:17:48,797
research services

7950
05:17:46,797 --> 05:17:50,159
you might have information which you

7951
05:17:48,797 --> 05:17:51,840
feel we are interested we might be

7952
05:17:50,159 --> 05:17:53,759
interested in

7953
05:17:51,840 --> 05:17:56,878
in any case

7954
05:17:53,759 --> 05:17:59,359
feel free to contact us at any time

7955
05:17:56,878 --> 05:18:02,479
two years ago in washington dc

7956
05:17:59,360 --> 05:18:04,479
i stated we were looking for help

7957
05:18:02,479 --> 05:18:08,079
the response was damn few offers and a

7958
05:18:04,479 --> 05:18:10,319
lot of rocks thrown in our direction

7959
05:18:08,080 --> 05:18:12,320
i can say to you now

7960
05:18:10,319 --> 05:18:13,439
that at last inventory we had plenty of

7961
05:18:12,319 --> 05:18:16,319
rocks

7962
05:18:13,439 --> 05:18:17,919
we still need the help

7963
05:18:16,319 --> 05:18:19,360
those of you that still have rocks to

7964
05:18:17,919 --> 05:18:20,957
throw

7965
05:18:19,360 --> 05:18:22,878
allow me to suggest that they might be

7966
05:18:20,957 --> 05:18:24,797
put to better use by tossing them at the

7967
05:18:22,878 --> 05:18:26,718
rumor mongers

7968
05:18:24,797 --> 05:18:28,637
or the disinformers

7969
05:18:26,718 --> 05:18:31,280
or the incompetents

7970
05:18:28,637 --> 05:18:32,559
that are presently running rampant

7971
05:18:31,279 --> 05:18:35,599
those people are the ones that are

7972
05:18:32,560 --> 05:18:37,760
giving us a bad image

7973
05:18:35,599 --> 05:18:39,919
question 17

7974
05:18:37,759 --> 05:18:42,159
what about the so-called blue book 13

7975
05:18:39,919 --> 05:18:43,679
report

7976
05:18:42,159 --> 05:18:45,759
answer

7977
05:18:43,680 --> 05:18:47,760
i think it's best left up to those who

7978
05:18:45,759 --> 05:18:50,797
are circulating this material to provide

7979
05:18:47,759 --> 05:18:53,119
the proof of its authenticity

7980
05:18:50,797 --> 05:18:55,759
i remain unconvinced of it but

7981
05:18:53,119 --> 05:18:55,759
open-minded

7982
05:18:55,919 --> 05:19:00,717
which brings me at last to the final

7983
05:18:57,680 --> 05:19:02,319
section of this lengthy paper

7984
05:19:00,718 --> 05:19:04,080
it seems to me that it's high time i

7985
05:19:02,319 --> 05:19:06,000
made my position clear about a few

7986
05:19:04,080 --> 05:19:07,360
things

7987
05:19:06,000 --> 05:19:08,878
a lot of people seem to be very

7988
05:19:07,360 --> 05:19:10,319
interested in knowing where bill moore

7989
05:19:08,878 --> 05:19:12,560
stands

7990
05:19:10,319 --> 05:19:14,079
so here goes

7991
05:19:12,560 --> 05:19:16,080
let me begin by stating that the

7992
05:19:14,080 --> 05:19:17,920
positions presented here are entirely my

7993
05:19:16,080 --> 05:19:20,000
own

7994
05:19:17,919 --> 05:19:22,079
all are based upon evidence obtained by

7995
05:19:20,000 --> 05:19:24,797
me and by associates

7996
05:19:22,080 --> 05:19:26,840
during the course of our project

7997
05:19:24,797 --> 05:19:29,279
some of that has been made available

7998
05:19:26,840 --> 05:19:31,040
already some is provided for the first

7999
05:19:29,279 --> 05:19:32,878
time in this paper

8000
05:19:31,040 --> 05:19:36,080
and some remains to be released at a

8001
05:19:32,878 --> 05:19:37,920
later more appropriate time

8002
05:19:36,080 --> 05:19:40,878
as to the existence and depth of that

8003
05:19:37,919 --> 05:19:42,559
which yet is yet to be released

8004
05:19:40,878 --> 05:19:44,958
you'll just have to take my word for the

8005
05:19:42,560 --> 05:19:47,760
time being

8006
05:19:44,957 --> 05:19:50,399
to best to the best of my knowledge

8007
05:19:47,759 --> 05:19:51,599
everything here is true

8008
05:19:50,400 --> 05:19:53,920
indeed

8009
05:19:51,599 --> 05:19:55,840
although i confess to having practiced

8010
05:19:53,919 --> 05:19:57,439
an occasional deception now and again

8011
05:19:55,840 --> 05:19:59,920
over the years in order to protect the

8012
05:19:57,439 --> 05:20:02,559
integrity of what i was doing

8013
05:19:59,919 --> 05:20:05,119
our goal from the very beginning

8014
05:20:02,560 --> 05:20:07,200
was to keep things as aboveboard as

8015
05:20:05,119 --> 05:20:10,718
possible

8016
05:20:07,200 --> 05:20:14,637
after all ours is a search for answers

8017
05:20:10,718 --> 05:20:14,637
not an effort to create more mysteries

8018
05:20:16,797 --> 05:20:21,279
position number one

8019
05:20:19,439 --> 05:20:22,840
is that a highly advanced

8020
05:20:21,279 --> 05:20:26,557
extraterrestrial

8021
05:20:22,840 --> 05:20:28,400
civilization is visiting planet earth

8022
05:20:26,558 --> 05:20:31,920
and is actively manipulating our

8023
05:20:28,400 --> 05:20:31,920
awareness of their presence here

8024
05:20:32,878 --> 05:20:37,360
position number two

8025
05:20:35,360 --> 05:20:39,200
elements of at least two of the u.s

8026
05:20:37,360 --> 05:20:41,279
government's intelligence agencies are

8027
05:20:39,200 --> 05:20:43,280
aware of this

8028
05:20:41,279 --> 05:20:44,797
and both are presently conducting highly

8029
05:20:43,279 --> 05:20:48,399
classified

8030
05:20:44,797 --> 05:20:48,399
ongoing research projects

8031
05:20:49,119 --> 05:20:52,319
i can tell you without reservation that

8032
05:20:50,878 --> 05:20:54,080
at least one of these efforts and

8033
05:20:52,319 --> 05:20:56,718
possibly both

8034
05:20:54,080 --> 05:20:58,638
has access to electromagnetic optical

8035
05:20:56,718 --> 05:21:00,558
and infrared signature data which if

8036
05:20:58,637 --> 05:21:02,479
released to the public

8037
05:21:00,558 --> 05:21:05,040
would provide proof positive that some

8038
05:21:02,479 --> 05:21:07,840
ufos represent somebody else's highly

8039
05:21:05,040 --> 05:21:07,840
advanced technology

8040
05:21:08,797 --> 05:21:13,599
unfortunately

8041
05:21:11,040 --> 05:21:16,240
i can't tell you more at this time

8042
05:21:13,599 --> 05:21:18,159
i wish i could

8043
05:21:16,240 --> 05:21:19,360
those of you who find me competent and

8044
05:21:18,159 --> 05:21:21,840
credible

8045
05:21:19,360 --> 05:21:24,558
we'll take this as a revelation

8046
05:21:21,840 --> 05:21:26,159
which is as it should be

8047
05:21:24,558 --> 05:21:28,080
those who hold other opinions will

8048
05:21:26,159 --> 05:21:30,240
continue to throw rocks while loudly

8049
05:21:28,080 --> 05:21:32,160
demanding at the same time that i

8050
05:21:30,240 --> 05:21:34,159
deliver proof positive into their hands

8051
05:21:32,159 --> 05:21:35,919
on a silver platter so that they can

8052
05:21:34,159 --> 05:21:37,520
call it their own and claim credit for

8053
05:21:35,919 --> 05:21:40,557
it

8054
05:21:37,520 --> 05:21:40,558
patience my friends

8055
05:21:42,159 --> 05:21:46,479
position three

8056
05:21:44,558 --> 05:21:48,319
u s government counter intelligence

8057
05:21:46,479 --> 05:21:50,239
people have conducted an on-again

8058
05:21:48,319 --> 05:21:53,200
off-again campaign of deception and

8059
05:21:50,240 --> 05:21:56,558
disinformation about the ufo phenomenon

8060
05:21:53,200 --> 05:21:56,558
for more than 40 years

8061
05:21:56,718 --> 05:22:00,718
those who have been responsible for such

8062
05:21:58,637 --> 05:22:03,840
operations are highly placed individuals

8063
05:22:00,718 --> 05:22:05,360
within at least two separate agencies

8064
05:22:03,840 --> 05:22:08,637
and there does seem to be a degree of

8065
05:22:05,360 --> 05:22:08,637
cooperation between them

8066
05:22:08,957 --> 05:22:14,079
these operations involve a large number

8067
05:22:10,957 --> 05:22:15,840
of people and are well organized

8068
05:22:14,080 --> 05:22:17,280
they also include the use of phony

8069
05:22:15,840 --> 05:22:19,040
documents

8070
05:22:17,279 --> 05:22:20,479
and the recruiting of informants who are

8071
05:22:19,040 --> 05:22:22,000
able to provide information on the

8072
05:22:20,479 --> 05:22:24,797
activities of people

8073
05:22:22,000 --> 05:22:27,520
conducting ufo research or who have had

8074
05:22:24,797 --> 05:22:28,840
ufo experiences

8075
05:22:27,520 --> 05:22:32,000
why is this

8076
05:22:28,840 --> 05:22:34,718
happening my experience suggests five

8077
05:22:32,000 --> 05:22:34,718
different reasons

8078
05:22:34,797 --> 05:22:39,199
a

8079
05:22:36,558 --> 05:22:41,440
the disinformation

8080
05:22:39,200 --> 05:22:44,319
provides security cover

8081
05:22:41,439 --> 05:22:46,000
for a real ufo project which exists at a

8082
05:22:44,319 --> 05:22:49,680
very high level

8083
05:22:46,000 --> 05:22:49,680
and is known only to an elite few

8084
05:22:50,319 --> 05:22:53,599
b

8085
05:22:51,520 --> 05:22:55,680
it is also useful

8086
05:22:53,599 --> 05:22:57,519
as part of a security process designed

8087
05:22:55,680 --> 05:22:59,439
to divert attention away from the real

8088
05:22:57,520 --> 05:23:01,119
but non-ufo-related

8089
05:22:59,439 --> 05:23:03,680
high-tech research and development

8090
05:23:01,119 --> 05:23:03,680
projects

8091
05:23:04,080 --> 05:23:07,440
c

8092
05:23:05,439 --> 05:23:09,520
it is a manipulation by a group of

8093
05:23:07,439 --> 05:23:11,680
highly placed and well-to-do individuals

8094
05:23:09,520 --> 05:23:14,479
like the trilateralists

8095
05:23:11,680 --> 05:23:16,558
who espouse a one-world philosophy

8096
05:23:14,479 --> 05:23:18,957
and who are using the ufo phenomena in

8097
05:23:16,558 --> 05:23:20,718
an effort to bring about world unity

8098
05:23:18,957 --> 05:23:23,119
in the face of an unknown threat from

8099
05:23:20,718 --> 05:23:23,119
space

8100
05:23:24,558 --> 05:23:28,240
it provides a convenient way to train

8101
05:23:26,718 --> 05:23:29,520
counter intelligence agents in the

8102
05:23:28,240 --> 05:23:32,320
techniques of deception and

8103
05:23:29,520 --> 05:23:32,319
disinformation

8104
05:23:32,400 --> 05:23:36,000
e

8105
05:23:33,599 --> 05:23:37,680
it is a manipulation by ufo aliens

8106
05:23:36,000 --> 05:23:39,680
themselves

8107
05:23:37,680 --> 05:23:43,599
as part of their plan to gradually make

8108
05:23:39,680 --> 05:23:48,040
human society aware of their presence

8109
05:23:43,599 --> 05:23:48,039
my position is that the truth is

8110
05:23:55,759 --> 05:23:59,840
whether those people are witting or

8111
05:23:57,439 --> 05:24:02,840
unwitting tools of this process i do not

8112
05:23:59,840 --> 05:24:02,840
know

8113
05:24:10,718 --> 05:24:15,040
the last

8114
05:24:13,040 --> 05:24:17,120
best thing the disinformation people

8115
05:24:15,040 --> 05:24:18,798
expected however

8116
05:24:17,119 --> 05:24:21,279
is that someone who knew of their

8117
05:24:18,797 --> 05:24:24,557
activities with a benefits affair

8118
05:24:21,279 --> 05:24:27,520
would pop up after so many years

8119
05:24:24,558 --> 05:24:27,520
and burst their balloon

8120
05:24:28,637 --> 05:24:32,957
position four

8121
05:24:31,200 --> 05:24:35,760
we have been able to confirm that there

8122
05:24:32,957 --> 05:24:37,520
is in fact a group known as mj-12 which

8123
05:24:35,759 --> 05:24:40,557
operates at the white house national

8124
05:24:37,520 --> 05:24:42,319
security council level

8125
05:24:40,558 --> 05:24:46,240
it's the best of my knowledge this group

8126
05:24:42,319 --> 05:24:48,239
still uses mj-12 as the designator

8127
05:24:46,240 --> 05:24:50,718
the level 6 level of security around

8128
05:24:48,240 --> 05:24:53,520
this group is such that we have not yet

8129
05:24:50,718 --> 05:24:56,240
succeeded in establishing whether or not

8130
05:24:53,520 --> 05:24:58,558
its functions are ufo related

8131
05:24:56,240 --> 05:25:00,958
or even precisely how long the group has

8132
05:24:58,558 --> 05:25:00,958
existed

8133
05:25:01,360 --> 05:25:05,520
along these same

8134
05:25:02,840 --> 05:25:07,920
lines none of our sources has indicated

8135
05:25:05,520 --> 05:25:11,760
any knowledge whatsoever with terms such

8136
05:25:07,919 --> 05:25:14,000
as magi majesty pi40 plato

8137
05:25:11,759 --> 05:25:16,840
garnet or a number of other terms

8138
05:25:14,000 --> 05:25:18,479
currently being spread by certain

8139
05:25:16,840 --> 05:25:20,558
elements

8140
05:25:18,479 --> 05:25:24,957
position five

8141
05:25:20,558 --> 05:25:27,440
there is in fact a project aquarius

8142
05:25:24,957 --> 05:25:28,877
possibly two of them

8143
05:25:27,439 --> 05:25:30,957
they have succeeded in obtaining

8144
05:25:28,878 --> 05:25:34,878
considerable information about one such

8145
05:25:30,957 --> 05:25:37,279
project in the 1971 73 time frame

8146
05:25:34,878 --> 05:25:38,958
and sketchy information about another

8147
05:25:37,279 --> 05:25:40,000
which may be a later extension of the

8148
05:25:38,957 --> 05:25:43,919
first one

8149
05:25:40,000 --> 05:25:46,000
in the 76 to 85 time frame

8150
05:25:43,919 --> 05:25:47,759
this information includes contract and

8151
05:25:46,000 --> 05:25:49,200
report numbers

8152
05:25:47,759 --> 05:25:52,717
as well as the names of several

8153
05:25:49,200 --> 05:25:56,080
individuals who worked on the project

8154
05:25:52,718 --> 05:25:57,680
more details will be forthcoming later

8155
05:25:56,080 --> 05:26:00,000
meanwhile

8156
05:25:57,680 --> 05:26:01,760
it ill behooves ufo researchers to

8157
05:26:00,000 --> 05:26:03,439
deluge the government with freedom

8158
05:26:01,759 --> 05:26:07,439
freedom of information requests for

8159
05:26:03,439 --> 05:26:09,279
details of sensitive high-level projects

8160
05:26:07,439 --> 05:26:11,199
this simply alerts the powers that be

8161
05:26:09,279 --> 05:26:13,599
that you are on to them

8162
05:26:11,200 --> 05:26:15,200
and thus makes it all the more difficult

8163
05:26:13,599 --> 05:26:17,359
to obtain information through other

8164
05:26:15,200 --> 05:26:19,280
channels

8165
05:26:17,360 --> 05:26:20,637
in the rush for me first in the ufo

8166
05:26:19,279 --> 05:26:24,319
community

8167
05:26:20,637 --> 05:26:25,599
we are often our own worst enemies

8168
05:26:24,319 --> 05:26:28,239
discretion

8169
05:26:25,599 --> 05:26:30,557
is the better part of valor

8170
05:26:28,240 --> 05:26:32,958
position six

8171
05:26:30,558 --> 05:26:34,638
with respect to the controversial mj-12

8172
05:26:32,957 --> 05:26:36,797
papers

8173
05:26:34,637 --> 05:26:39,840
these have now been examined by a number

8174
05:26:36,797 --> 05:26:42,239
of question documents experts

8175
05:26:39,840 --> 05:26:43,599
and other research on them is continuing

8176
05:26:42,240 --> 05:26:46,320
as well as you've just heard from my

8177
05:26:43,599 --> 05:26:46,319
friend stanton

8178
05:26:46,400 --> 05:26:51,200
in the case of the cutler twining memo

8179
05:26:48,319 --> 05:26:53,520
found in the national archives

8180
05:26:51,200 --> 05:26:56,637
i can state with reasonable certainty

8181
05:26:53,520 --> 05:26:58,400
that it is an authentic document

8182
05:26:56,637 --> 05:27:00,637
and the best evidence indicates that

8183
05:26:58,400 --> 05:27:02,798
someone planted it amidst the papers of

8184
05:27:00,637 --> 05:27:04,399
record group 341

8185
05:27:02,797 --> 05:27:07,279
knowing that there was a strong chance

8186
05:27:04,400 --> 05:27:07,280
we would find it there

8187
05:27:07,439 --> 05:27:11,599
with respect to the so-called eisenhower

8188
05:27:09,520 --> 05:27:13,439
briefing document

8189
05:27:11,599 --> 05:27:16,159
there is still no compelling reason to

8190
05:27:13,439 --> 05:27:18,239
believe it is anything but authentic

8191
05:27:16,159 --> 05:27:20,637
on the other hand its authenticity

8192
05:27:18,240 --> 05:27:22,400
remains far from proved

8193
05:27:20,637 --> 05:27:24,000
so in the final analysis the scale

8194
05:27:22,400 --> 05:27:26,798
remains balanced by the weight of

8195
05:27:24,000 --> 05:27:28,957
arguments on both sides

8196
05:27:26,797 --> 05:27:30,557
if it's the real thing

8197
05:27:28,957 --> 05:27:32,079
it's going to take extraordinary

8198
05:27:30,558 --> 05:27:34,718
evidence to convince even some of the

8199
05:27:32,080 --> 05:27:36,638
more liberal skeptics

8200
05:27:34,718 --> 05:27:39,200
if it's a hoax

8201
05:27:36,637 --> 05:27:40,399
it's extraordinarily well done

8202
05:27:39,200 --> 05:27:42,159
much better

8203
05:27:40,400 --> 05:27:43,520
than the sort of disinformation i

8204
05:27:42,159 --> 05:27:45,759
encountered in connection with the

8205
05:27:43,520 --> 05:27:46,797
benowitz case

8206
05:27:45,759 --> 05:27:50,000
of course

8207
05:27:46,797 --> 05:27:53,840
it still may be disinformation

8208
05:27:50,000 --> 05:27:53,840
but again then again it may not

8209
05:27:54,319 --> 05:27:58,479
either way

8210
05:27:55,759 --> 05:28:01,759
there's a major story here

8211
05:27:58,479 --> 05:28:03,200
and the controversy is far from over

8212
05:28:01,759 --> 05:28:04,840
if it's real

8213
05:28:03,200 --> 05:28:08,080
it speaks for

8214
05:28:04,840 --> 05:28:12,558
itself if it's disinformation

8215
05:28:08,080 --> 05:28:15,040
the equally important story of why

8216
05:28:12,558 --> 05:28:17,120
needs to be told

8217
05:28:15,040 --> 05:28:20,040
as for the so-called truman executive

8218
05:28:17,119 --> 05:28:21,759
order of september 24th

8219
05:28:20,040 --> 05:28:23,520
1947

8220
05:28:21,759 --> 05:28:25,199
which is actually the final page of the

8221
05:28:23,520 --> 05:28:26,878
portion of the eisenhower document which

8222
05:28:25,200 --> 05:28:28,479
we have

8223
05:28:26,878 --> 05:28:30,558
the analysts have come up with mixed

8224
05:28:28,479 --> 05:28:32,957
results

8225
05:28:30,558 --> 05:28:36,798
though not yet disproved this document

8226
05:28:32,957 --> 05:28:36,797
presents the weakest case of the three

8227
05:28:37,680 --> 05:28:41,760
we are working

8228
05:28:39,360 --> 05:28:43,600
on a final report on this matter which

8229
05:28:41,759 --> 05:28:45,919
will include the results of typeface

8230
05:28:43,599 --> 05:28:49,119
analysis and other processes it's going

8231
05:28:45,919 --> 05:28:50,877
to be a lengthy affair

8232
05:28:49,119 --> 05:28:52,637
before leaving it however i would like

8233
05:28:50,878 --> 05:28:54,400
to at least comment on what has emerged

8234
05:28:52,637 --> 05:28:57,279
as the most controversial aspect of the

8235
05:28:54,400 --> 05:29:00,080
mj-12 document affair

8236
05:28:57,279 --> 05:29:01,439
that is a date format

8237
05:29:00,080 --> 05:29:03,840
there are a couple of points i would

8238
05:29:01,439 --> 05:29:03,840
like to make

8239
05:29:04,000 --> 05:29:07,919
one

8240
05:29:05,360 --> 05:29:10,240
if the similarities between stylistic

8241
05:29:07,919 --> 05:29:12,957
characteristics of the documents

8242
05:29:10,240 --> 05:29:15,680
and my own writings are important as

8243
05:29:12,957 --> 05:29:17,399
some have claimed

8244
05:29:15,680 --> 05:29:21,360
then are not

8245
05:29:17,400 --> 05:29:24,159
dissimilarities equally important

8246
05:29:21,360 --> 05:29:27,680
there are some you know

8247
05:29:24,159 --> 05:29:27,680
even in the way the dates are written

8248
05:29:28,000 --> 05:29:33,040
why do those who go to such pains to

8249
05:29:30,159 --> 05:29:36,319
point out similarities

8250
05:29:33,040 --> 05:29:37,840
not go to equal pains to point out disc

8251
05:29:36,319 --> 05:29:40,000
similarities

8252
05:29:37,840 --> 05:29:42,319
especially when they claim to be using

8253
05:29:40,000 --> 05:29:45,279
the scientific method

8254
05:29:42,319 --> 05:29:47,360
could i wonder be prejudiced

8255
05:29:45,279 --> 05:29:50,079
or does the word incompetence better

8256
05:29:47,360 --> 05:29:50,080
describe it

8257
05:29:50,957 --> 05:29:54,479
two

8258
05:29:52,400 --> 05:29:56,480
we are by no means convinced that the

8259
05:29:54,479 --> 05:29:59,520
date format is as critical an issue as

8260
05:29:56,479 --> 05:30:03,680
others would make it out to be

8261
05:29:59,520 --> 05:30:06,080
while the style is admittedly unusual

8262
05:30:03,680 --> 05:30:07,840
it is not without precedent

8263
05:30:06,080 --> 05:30:10,240
and that of course is the bottom line

8264
05:30:07,840 --> 05:30:10,240
isn't it

8265
05:30:10,840 --> 05:30:16,080
three to those of you who still harbor

8266
05:30:13,840 --> 05:30:18,479
suspicions that i created the documents

8267
05:30:16,080 --> 05:30:22,240
and i'm perpetrating a hoax

8268
05:30:18,479 --> 05:30:22,239
i say thank you for the compliment

8269
05:30:22,718 --> 05:30:25,920
those of you who think it more likely

8270
05:30:24,319 --> 05:30:28,000
that i am the innocent victim of an

8271
05:30:25,919 --> 05:30:29,679
elaborate hoax

8272
05:30:28,000 --> 05:30:31,360
i conceived that this remains a

8273
05:30:29,680 --> 05:30:34,400
possibility which has not yet been

8274
05:30:31,360 --> 05:30:34,400
entirely ruled out

8275
05:30:34,558 --> 05:30:40,958
position seven

8276
05:30:37,279 --> 05:30:43,919
the matter of alien abductions of humans

8277
05:30:40,957 --> 05:30:46,000
is apparently regarded as serious

8278
05:30:43,919 --> 05:30:47,759
by those within the government

8279
05:30:46,000 --> 05:30:50,637
who are aware of the extraterrestrial

8280
05:30:47,759 --> 05:30:52,399
nature of ufos

8281
05:30:50,637 --> 05:30:54,680
this is evidenced by the fact that the

8282
05:30:52,400 --> 05:30:56,240
government has gone so far as to

8283
05:30:54,680 --> 05:30:59,119
disinform

8284
05:30:56,240 --> 05:31:02,159
its own counter intelligence people on

8285
05:30:59,119 --> 05:31:02,159
that very subject

8286
05:31:06,957 --> 05:31:11,439
i don't know

8287
05:31:08,957 --> 05:31:14,000
position eight

8288
05:31:11,439 --> 05:31:16,637
the secret behind the government ufo

8289
05:31:14,000 --> 05:31:20,000
cover-up is essentially an awareness

8290
05:31:16,637 --> 05:31:21,200
of what ufos are by a few people in high

8291
05:31:20,000 --> 05:31:23,040
places

8292
05:31:21,200 --> 05:31:26,718
who have connections with the national

8293
05:31:23,040 --> 05:31:26,718
security council in the white house

8294
05:31:26,878 --> 05:31:31,520
widespread publicity about the abduction

8295
05:31:29,040 --> 05:31:35,600
phenomenon

8296
05:31:31,520 --> 05:31:35,600
in what is already a difficult situation

8297
05:31:35,680 --> 05:31:39,520
within group there are strong

8298
05:31:37,439 --> 05:31:41,119
differences of opinion

8299
05:31:39,520 --> 05:31:44,240
as to whether information should be

8300
05:31:41,119 --> 05:31:46,079
released to the public and how fast

8301
05:31:44,240 --> 05:31:48,000
there seems to be some consternation

8302
05:31:46,080 --> 05:31:51,000
about exactly who is in control of the

8303
05:31:48,000 --> 05:31:51,000
situation

8304
05:31:52,000 --> 05:31:57,040
position nine

8305
05:31:54,558 --> 05:32:00,000
ufology has been stumbling around for 30

8306
05:31:57,040 --> 05:32:02,159
years looking for answers

8307
05:32:00,000 --> 05:32:04,797
unless something is done

8308
05:32:02,159 --> 05:32:06,718
to reduce the petty bickering

8309
05:32:04,797 --> 05:32:08,557
the rumor mongering

8310
05:32:06,718 --> 05:32:10,558
the name calling

8311
05:32:08,558 --> 05:32:13,040
the ego massaging

8312
05:32:10,558 --> 05:32:15,040
the power politics and the personal

8313
05:32:13,040 --> 05:32:16,000
vendettas which have been taking up our

8314
05:32:15,040 --> 05:32:18,240
time

8315
05:32:16,000 --> 05:32:20,080
sapping our strength and disgracing our

8316
05:32:18,240 --> 05:32:22,240
image lately

8317
05:32:20,080 --> 05:32:24,080
i expect mainstream ufology will go

8318
05:32:22,240 --> 05:32:26,000
right on stumbling for a long time to

8319
05:32:24,080 --> 05:32:27,600
come

8320
05:32:26,000 --> 05:32:29,200
what is needed

8321
05:32:27,599 --> 05:32:31,759
i submit

8322
05:32:29,200 --> 05:32:33,600
is a society of professional ufologist

8323
05:32:31,759 --> 05:32:36,399
which adheres to established research

8324
05:32:33,599 --> 05:32:38,877
procedures and techniques

8325
05:32:36,400 --> 05:32:40,878
which maintains a rigorous set of ethics

8326
05:32:38,878 --> 05:32:43,760
and standards

8327
05:32:40,878 --> 05:32:45,600
and which limits its membership to a few

8328
05:32:43,759 --> 05:32:47,439
whose competence has been appropriately

8329
05:32:45,599 --> 05:32:50,159
demonstrated

8330
05:32:47,439 --> 05:32:52,319
no matter what happens however

8331
05:32:50,159 --> 05:32:55,040
i am committed to completing the process

8332
05:32:52,319 --> 05:32:57,360
i have begun

8333
05:32:55,040 --> 05:33:00,319
i am presently working with a network of

8334
05:32:57,360 --> 05:33:02,400
more than a dozen individuals

8335
05:33:00,319 --> 05:33:04,319
some of whom hold some very impressive

8336
05:33:02,400 --> 05:33:06,558
credentials

8337
05:33:04,319 --> 05:33:10,000
we have been actively exploring the

8338
05:33:06,558 --> 05:33:12,798
labyrinth of government ufo involvement

8339
05:33:10,000 --> 05:33:15,759
and we will continue to do so

8340
05:33:12,797 --> 05:33:19,279
until we feel the task is complete

8341
05:33:15,759 --> 05:33:19,279
or that we can go no further

8342
05:33:19,360 --> 05:33:23,760
our group

8343
05:33:20,878 --> 05:33:25,440
is euphemistically called the aviary

8344
05:33:23,759 --> 05:33:27,279
and each individual

8345
05:33:25,439 --> 05:33:29,759
uses a code name of a bird is an

8346
05:33:27,279 --> 05:33:31,680
identifier

8347
05:33:29,759 --> 05:33:35,199
we will continue

8348
05:33:31,680 --> 05:33:37,760
to provide the ufo community with data

8349
05:33:35,200 --> 05:33:40,840
and we will continue to proceed

8350
05:33:37,759 --> 05:33:42,957
in a way which we feel best suits our

8351
05:33:40,840 --> 05:33:44,637
purposes a number of people have

8352
05:33:42,957 --> 05:33:46,399
suggested to me recently that i should

8353
05:33:44,637 --> 05:33:48,399
defend myself

8354
05:33:46,400 --> 05:33:51,760
against various allegations and rumors

8355
05:33:48,400 --> 05:33:53,360
which have been circulating lately

8356
05:33:51,759 --> 05:33:55,679
well folks you've just heard the case

8357
05:33:53,360 --> 05:33:57,520
for the defense

8358
05:33:55,680 --> 05:34:00,558
now reach down inside of yourselves and

8359
05:33:57,520 --> 05:34:02,718
wrench forth of judgment

8360
05:34:00,558 --> 05:34:05,040
i and my group of associates are going

8361
05:34:02,718 --> 05:34:06,319
to find some answers no matter what it

8362
05:34:05,040 --> 05:34:09,760
takes

8363
05:34:06,319 --> 05:34:11,599
and no matter how long it takes

8364
05:34:09,759 --> 05:34:12,797
we are out there

8365
05:34:11,599 --> 05:34:15,439
digging

8366
05:34:12,797 --> 05:34:17,199
and we are going to continue to dig

8367
05:34:15,439 --> 05:34:18,479
either with the support of the ufo

8368
05:34:17,200 --> 05:34:21,119
community

8369
05:34:18,479 --> 05:34:23,759
or without it

8370
05:34:21,119 --> 05:34:24,797
armchair researchers and hasty pudding

8371
05:34:23,759 --> 05:34:26,877
pot shop

8372
05:34:24,797 --> 05:34:28,637
plagiarist ufologists

8373
05:34:26,878 --> 05:34:30,479
whose only goal is to make themselves

8374
05:34:28,637 --> 05:34:32,557
look important at others expense take

8375
05:34:30,479 --> 05:34:34,000
note

8376
05:34:32,558 --> 05:34:35,600
those of you who think we're doing a

8377
05:34:34,000 --> 05:34:37,040
good job and want to be part of that

8378
05:34:35,599 --> 05:34:38,957
process

8379
05:34:37,040 --> 05:34:42,080
please know that we welcome any support

8380
05:34:38,957 --> 05:34:43,759
you feel you can offer even if we've had

8381
05:34:42,080 --> 05:34:45,920
personal differences between us in the

8382
05:34:43,759 --> 05:34:48,797
past

8383
05:34:45,919 --> 05:34:51,519
those who feel it's all a con game

8384
05:34:48,797 --> 05:34:53,599
or that it's all disinformation

8385
05:34:51,520 --> 05:34:54,957
can continue to throw all the rocks you

8386
05:34:53,599 --> 05:34:57,919
want

8387
05:34:54,957 --> 05:35:01,119
we're going to go right on without you

8388
05:34:57,919 --> 05:35:01,119
just as we always have

8389
05:35:02,080 --> 05:35:04,000

05:35:04,000 --> 05:35:09,840
i wish to state that the text you've

8392
05:35:05,599 --> 05:35:11,039
just heard me read is copyrighted

8393
05:35:09,840 --> 05:35:13,439

8394
05:35:11,040 --> 05:35:15,600

is prohibited

8398
05:35:18,400 --> 05:35:23,840
and finally this paper marks a radical

8399
05:35:21,119 --> 05:35:25,680
change of position for me

8400
05:35:23,840 --> 05:35:27,680
in the past i've always been very

8401
05:35:25,680 --> 05:35:29,119
careful to qualify my statements about

8402
05:35:27,680 --> 05:35:31,840
the possible

8403
05:35:29,119 --> 05:35:35,439
extraterrestrial nature of ufos so as to

8404
05:35:31,840 --> 05:35:37,439
leave room for other explanations

8405
05:35:35,439 --> 05:35:39,439
all the evidence that my associates and

8406
05:35:37,439 --> 05:35:42,399
i have accumulated to date however boils

8407
05:35:39,439 --> 05:35:43,759
down to two inescapable conclusions

8408
05:35:42,400 --> 05:35:45,600
first

8409
05:35:43,759 --> 05:35:47,439
there is an extraterrestrial presence

8410
05:35:45,599 --> 05:35:48,717
here on planet earth

8411
05:35:47,439 --> 05:35:50,797
and second

8412
05:35:48,718 --> 05:35:52,159
a small number of individuals within our

8413
05:35:50,797 --> 05:35:54,159
government know it

8414
05:35:52,159 --> 05:35:55,759
but remain undecided as to what to do

8415
05:35:54,159 --> 05:35:57,759
about it

8416
05:35:55,759 --> 05:35:59,279
these two things represent the bottom

8417
05:35:57,759 --> 05:36:00,717
line

8418
05:35:59,279 --> 05:36:03,119
from there

8419
05:36:00,718 --> 05:36:05,200
it's only a question when covering

8420
05:36:03,119 --> 05:36:07,039
just how much of the rest

8421
05:36:05,200 --> 05:36:08,798
of the ufo story

8422
05:36:07,040 --> 05:36:11,440
is for real

8423
05:36:08,797 --> 05:36:14,957
and how much of it is

8424
05:36:11,439 --> 05:36:18,000
that is precisely what we intend to do

8425
05:36:14,957 --> 05:36:20,479
so either climb aboard and hang on

8426
05:36:18,000 --> 05:36:24,400
or get off the tracks

8427
05:36:20,479 --> 05:36:26,159
i apologize for having taken so long

8428
05:36:24,400 --> 05:36:27,840
if i've offended

8429
05:36:26,159 --> 05:36:30,637
that's unfortunate

8430
05:36:27,840 --> 05:36:32,637
but i have tried to be truthful with you

8431
05:36:30,637 --> 05:36:35,119
i had a lot to say

8432
05:36:32,637 --> 05:36:36,079
and it needed to be said

8433
05:36:35,119 --> 05:36:38,809
thank you

8434
05:36:36,080 --> 05:36:43,419
good night and farewell

8435
05:36:38,810 --> 05:36:43,419
[Music]

8436
05:36:44,637 --> 05:36:46,718
you
