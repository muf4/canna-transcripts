yeah

80
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,199
and then there's a whole bunch of hoopla

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
and mystery and [ __ ] that gets

82
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,919
spewed about them

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,519
you know yeah yeah he's he's being

84
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,479
[ __ ] humble as [ __ ] because that's

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,800
who he is

86
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,079
but but the the reason i wanted to start

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,439
off my

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
the podcast essentially um with not so

89
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,158
dog

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,759
is because he is so integrated

91
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,039
integrally tied

92
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,919
into so many [ __ ] strains that are a

93
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,798
base of our whole cannabis culture and

94
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,439
he's

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,480
a and he's he's not uh a pea butt so

96
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,000
he's not throwing his name out there

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,598
real big and he's just you know

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,519
doing his thing i can't even get him to

99
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,959
[ __ ] sell seeds for the life i mean

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,039
been alive

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,560

regular basis

a bunch of mendo ps ones and we poked

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
around

132
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,839

and it uh luckily it has a wide variety

136
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,399
of

137
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,359
uh of genetics inside of it there's

138
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,319

leaves are green

143
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
um strangely and this i never expected

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
to see this

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,439
uh there was actually even some kush and

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,879
some pine soul

147
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,038
in maybe about ten percent of them uh

148
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,800
that was interesting that was pretty

149
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,199
surprising to me

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,600
you know and uh some of the nicest ones

151
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,600
hermed

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,360
but i mean there you go um

153
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,079
blue skies vienna there's not really a

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,199
deal between

155
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,680
any of us and blue skies vienna uh you

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,079
know

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,879
um i would i would call myself i'm

158
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,120
pretty polite

159
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,399
all in all regards and matt isn't so

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,720
polite and so

161
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,519
but we both have we both have a pretty

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,520
limited

163
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:12,079
uh patience for [ __ ] you know and so

164
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,560
you know um nobody nobody would be

165
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,800
happier for me to see a whole bunch of

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
rank roadkill skunk come back in the

167
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
community

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,439
um but i it's a bummer when people claim

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
things and then make a bunch of money

170
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,199
off the public for six months to a year

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,879
to a year and a half

172
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,879
before the word gets spread that they

173
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,360
don't really have what they have

174
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,800
and then they viciously attack anyone

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
that wants to [ __ ] with their money

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,600
train

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,240
yeah and so uh matt is pretty famous

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,879
for calling out [ __ ] as he sees it

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,120
uh and that endears him to some of us

180
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,478
and then other people take offense to

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,439
that you know

182
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,399
um and he you know and so he gets a

183
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,079
bunch of blowback

184
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,439
and then he's willing to give as good as

185
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,159
he gets

186
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,478
at times like that and so you know he

187
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
has a number of enemies out there

188
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,399
um but most of his enemies are just

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
people that

190
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,079
have something to hide yeah in my

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
opinion

192
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,758
and um and so they try to insult the

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,879
person

194
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,639
without insulting the quantity or

195
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,639
quality of his argument

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,879
correct right instead of responding to

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,360
the fact that they don't have rks

198
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,439
and they don't have rank skunk they make

199
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,720
fun of how tall he is or is breeding

200
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,120
how bad i am yeah or whatever

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
punk rock sucks and then you know or

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
whatever the case may be

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
to throw proof at the situation and

204
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,280
muddy the water so people won't believe

205
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,758
what he's trying to tell which is

206
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,159
basically telling the general public

207
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,080
be wary of this person and don't give

208
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,439
them a [ __ ] ton of your money

209
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,560
you know because it's probably not true

210
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,279
yeah and like like like i said before

211
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,319
uh the the skunk talk the proof is in

212
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,318
the pudding

213
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,800
everyone is going to be really aware

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
when somebody finds skunk

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,079
yeah it's not going to be hard we can

216
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
you can bring it to ec

217
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,399
you can bring it to one of these big

218
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,598
events you can crack the jar you can

219
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,038
smoke it with people

220
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,719
and everyone will know that you're not

221
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,199
full of [ __ ]

222
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
yeah that's basic and so until somebody

223
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
does that

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,120
you know or until it gets into my hands

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,000
or skunk boss hands or somebody that has

226
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,478
real provenance with the cut uh i don't

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,478
even

228
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,478
i mean i would love for my that original

229
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,478
super cut to exist

230
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,799
um you know if it doesn't exist

231
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,278
hopefully people find that terp

232
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,079
in some other combination of things you

233
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,240
know like

234
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,278
um even if a total [ __ ] that i

235
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,278
dislike

236
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,879
finds it and brings it to the meat

237
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,879
community great

238
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,159
yeah great because at least it's there

239
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,039
one of the things that we you know we

240
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,439
should say about

241
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,958
the seed business has always been shady

242
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,160
and the more you learn about a lot of

243
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,838
seed breeders

244
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,600
you have to segregate what you think of

245
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,560
them as personal people

246
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
from their contribution to the community

247
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,518
yeah

248
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,959
because some of them are right scumbags

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,039
right but they had an

250
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:09,919
undeniable uh they have an undeniable

251
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,639
contribution that can't be disparaged

252
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,479
sure

253
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,399
they might be a narc they might be an

254
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
[ __ ] they might be a cheat

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,519
they might be scummy but you know i mean

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,200
at the end of the day you contributed to

257
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,679
the gene pool what you did

258
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,600
yeah and so once you've done that you

259
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,039
can't take that away from someone

260
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,278
and all of the all of the old heroes

261
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,879
as it were everybody has the ones they

262
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,159
like more than others

263
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,799
yeah there are almost no honest folk

264
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,199
no not not in the old hero sense that's

265
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,159
it

266
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,440
i will say uh just if anybody if

267
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,399
anybody's out there listening

268
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
uh out of the old school ones i would

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
say

270
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,360
probably the two most honest ones are

271
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,039
uh mel frank i think mel frank in

272
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,639
general what he's said and what he's

273
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,838
contributed to in his part of the

274
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,080
stories or whatever

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,839
like i don't think we caught him in any

276
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,879
[ __ ] that i'm aware of i think he's

277
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,000
been pretty

278
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,679
upfront about what he did and how he

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
contributed to things and i also think

280
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,439
jorge cervantes

281
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
is yeah he's been helpful is in that

282
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,079
same boat

283
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,119
and the most important people in the

284
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,120
cannabis community

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,879
in my opinion um you know like and the

286
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,159
sort of godfathers of it all are neville

287
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:34,159
and sam skunk man david watson and

288
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:37,278
and jim ortega and you know a few others

289
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,559
and um they all have their supporters

290
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,919
and detractors

291
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,799
sure uh strongly and uh there's valid

292
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:48,159
points of suspicion and weirdness and

293
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:52,719
character issues at times you know yeah

294
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:54,399
so this leads into segways into

295
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,839
what we were kind of talking about last

296
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,519
night now

297
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,279
i i thought it was kind of interesting

298
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,799
that in all the years and in this is

299
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,838
including myself

300
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,799
no one has ever asked skunk va hey

301
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
this picture that is in the high times

302
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,559
of

303
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,278
the chem dog putting high times the

304
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,958
first thing is that the same

305
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,720
cut that came from your crew

306
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,039
because it's very distinctive looking

307
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
right and um

308
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,759
it doesn't look like it man it doesn't

309
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,599
look like it according to you

310
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,799
so there's a guy there's a guy that'll

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,920
remain nameless

312
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,078
that has an old nl cut

313
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,039
yeah right and most people probably

314
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,919
don't know this

315
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,360
but um you know matt and i's little

316
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,319
friend crew or whatever

317
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,680
um we have been in touch with um one of

318
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,440
the originators of the whole nl crew

319
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,519
um and we've interviewed and asked them

320
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
a bunch of questions and he's

321
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,078
actually been invaluable in filling in

322
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,559
some blanks and some history of what was

323
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,759
what

324
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,319
right and so this kid had this ancient

325
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,078
nl and he was absolutely sure it was

326
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
what it was and i was like man you know

327
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,078
if you want to send me

328
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,439
or one of us you know an eighth or a

329
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,838
quarter or something

330
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,800
we'll get it to dude and he can tell you

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,560
exactly

332
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:15,759
yeah and he got all mad and refused

333
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,319
so you know [ __ ] you you're lying yeah

334
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,000
exactly exactly if you don't if you

335
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,240
don't want to get your old famous

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,399
cut to the person that bred it

337
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
you know and then there's the flip side

338
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
of that and i've seen this

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120
i can't even tell you countless times

340
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
when someone

341
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
hits someone up and they come from the

342
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,719
point of view that appears to be that

343
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,360
they're actually trying to do real

344
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,200
historical research i had this uh i had

345
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
this with uh analog selections the guy

346
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,079
who's passing that the math super skunk

347
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,078
to everyone

348
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,759
um he came to me was asking about mass

349
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,879
super skunk in the history and what not

350
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,159
what we found out

351
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,600
and i was just being open and honest

352
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,958
with him hey this is this is what we

353
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,320
know this is it sharing pictures

354
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,638
illustrating like we do

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
um

356
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,879
i totally [ __ ] got stoned and forgot

357
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
what i was talking about

358
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,480
then i'll throw this out there so yeah

359
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,638
here's the thing so

360
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,959
[ __ ] you know uh matt and i are gonna

361
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,278
do a series of things about history

362
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,719
uh hopefully uh you know and that's

363
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,000
really the only reason why i mean i

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,040
wasn't willing to show my face for

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,399
forever

366
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:21,120
um but i'm tired of

367
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
so many people you know the loudest

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,200
voices

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,959
uh spewing the most [ __ ] you know

370
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,639
some of that needs some pushback because

371
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,199
the younger generation

372
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,240
and just history in general is better

373
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,240
served

374
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,959
uh in the long run it's better served

375
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,240
like by the real [ __ ] being out there

376
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:43,278
you know and you know and so

377
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
i mean you know you're

378
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,120
some of these discussions are going to

379
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,159
be wide ranging or [ __ ] or whatever but

380
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
what's going to happen is is that people

381
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,600
are going to

382
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,198
listen to [ __ ] and then they're going to

383
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
use that information

384
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,639
to make their [ __ ] in the future

385
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,078
more believable that's what i was

386
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,198
talking about yes

387
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,198
that's that's what you were and there's

388
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,359
just no [ __ ] way around that right so

389
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,838
yeah like i'll give you a perfect i'll

390
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,278
give you a perfect example okay

391
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,839
and maybe this should be saved for the

392
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,879
podcast or whatever okay

393
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,160
but someone before i even knew

394
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,320
csi someone who was super close to me

395
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,159
and had heard the story of how the mendo

396
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,360
perps happened in detail

397
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:28,240
okay honestly told that story

398
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,399
to csi yes there was some special

399
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,198
details in there right

400
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,278
and so he met before we before we

401
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,519
actually met a long ass time ago

402
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,278
uh and then lost track of each other but

403
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,399
when we reconnected

404
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,679
um and i told him my past he was putting

405
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
me through the i mean obviously people

406
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,679
call him the inspector right so

407
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,519
he's putting ringer and he's asking you

408
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,039
questions and some are true and some are

409
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,399
lies and he's trying to catch you in

410
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,799
[ __ ] you know yeah

411
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,159
he's amazing at it details that if

412
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,359
you're trying to [ __ ] you just

413
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,198
wouldn't have

414
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
yeah it's like you're all into murder

415
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,120
mysteries matt right so

416
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,159
yeah so you know a lot of times when

417
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,679
they put a murderer

418
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,078
when they when they report something

419
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,638
they print a couple things that are not

420
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,638
factual

421
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
that way when everybody calls and they

422
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,599
tell stories

423
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
that they have a lead yeah they weed out

424
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,159
a bunch of the people

425
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,479
that don't know the truth correct right

426
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,240
and

427
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
otherwise they'll get hundreds and

428
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,680
hundreds of bad leads

429
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
yeah they have to track down and act

430
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,359
like they're real yeah

431
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,839
so you know and and so the more history

432
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,720
that i

433
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
that we spout on some of these subjects

434
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,440
you know

435
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,278
um with the double-edged sword for sure

436
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,839
in the future to like

437
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,799
shape up you know i mean there's another

438
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,959
guy that like we

439
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,719
that we won't say you know his name just

440
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,799
did not give him any fame but we pushed

441
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,000
back against a bunch of his [ __ ]

442
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,838
and he's claiming to have cuts from

443
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
two or three years before they were

444
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
released to the public ever

445
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,680
yeah like they weren't even created at

446
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,278
the time and he slapped a year up there

447
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,120
out in 95 and they're like i've got a 93

448
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,720
yeah well if you were there from the era

449
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,360
you know they're full of [ __ ]

450
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,079
and that's why pip invented the term the

451
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,959
pre-pre and how it got famous

452
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,319
and so you know and you know and so all

453
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,518
that and so

454
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,759
you know i mean uh you know that's the

455
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,959
you know for a long time nobody gave a

456
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
rat's ass

457
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,958
about any of these old cuts they just

458
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,480
wanted to knew they just wanted what was

459
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,278
easy and now that this thing has

460
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
happened

461
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,958
and the game has changed a bit old

462
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,160
ancient

463
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,278
my uncle my father my secret chemist

464
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,159
friend

465
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,039
hiding everyone's got these stories of

466
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,519
how these long

467
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,240
lost things carefully passed down to

468
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,078
them

469
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,159
and here's the parts of the story that i

470
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,120
remember but it's absolutely

471
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,838
legit yes so you know we go we run

472
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,078
around poking holes in these balloons

473
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,759
because yeah many of them have [ __ ]

474
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,638
parts of the story that simply can't be

475
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,480
true

476
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,038
yeah and then everybody has an unca

477
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,919
everybody has the famous secret uncle

478
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,240
that has the

479
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,120
just the bomb diggity and gave it only

480
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
to them

481
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,318
you know that's right and you know

482
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,159
people do

483
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,599
uh whoever just said this people breed

484
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,480
all the same stuff

485
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,838
so that's a problem is that in my

486
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,519
opinion

487
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,318
and i've said this a bunch is that the

488
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,558
90s was the golden era

489
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,599
and the reason why is that a bunch of

490
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,160
stuff

491
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,000
there was a lot of diversity and if it

492
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
was good weed it sold

493
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,599
yeah meant that an enormous amount of

494
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
people could grow an enormous amount of

495
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,279
different strains of weed

496
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,480
and they would all sell and thus people

497
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,798
would hold on to them

498
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,759
and there was a bunch of [ __ ] and every

499
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,400
single time there's been a name craze

500
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,160
the the early 2000s purple craze with

501
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,679
granddaddy purp grape ape

502
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,200
urkel from me all that stuff

503

508
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,600
same [ __ ] thing

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
yeah right so now you've got

510
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,119
you know and i joke about this but if

511
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,558
you go back and you look at

512
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:22,079
like european kings and queens right

513
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,759
they all end up inbred always five years

514
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,519
they only [ __ ] each other

515
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,759
you know the family in spain and the

516
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,519
family in england and the family in

517
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,119
germany they're like they're marrying

518
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,240
first cousins they're marrying their

519
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,319
[ __ ] uncle

520
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,599
they're marrying this and this and this

521
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,038
and so now

522
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,959
the amount of things you have that have

523
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,279
cookie in it or cushion it

524
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,000
or this in it there's probably 30 to 50

525
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,359
cuts

526
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,839
that have been bred into [ __ ]

527
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,719
everything oh yeah absolutely

528
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,359
everything everything is popular you

529
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,919
know

530
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,719
i mean i don't know if i don't know if

531
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,038
uh

532
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
if archive is still on here or whatever

533
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,720
yeah

534
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,798
exactly you know but i mean you know

535
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,759
docido becomes famous

536
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,720
and boom docidos and everything yeah

537
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,359
boom skittles

538
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,558
and everything boom all these ot cuts

539
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,879
are and everything you know

540
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,879
and all that and so basically over the

541
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,200
last 15 or 20 years

542
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
we've been on a massive short-term

543
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
bottlenecking project

544
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,279
sure all this diversity and so now we're

545
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,439
all looking around and we're like oh

546
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,079
where's all that diversity

547
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,160
you know because you know i mean we

548
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,639
we've done this whole thing on uh

549
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,919
you know you can hate docido that's fine

550
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
you know i mean

551
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,440
to be honest uh you know i find the chem

552
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,279
dog

553
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,279
to be one of my top three or four

554
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,639
favorite things and my buddy

555
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,798
and i have some really good buddies that

556
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,120
don't think highly of it

557
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,240
doesn't work for them very well so you

558
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,199
know when i

559
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,480
if i basically feel like if there's an

560
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,798
elite cutting

561
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,759
it's because there's enough heads that

562
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,960
like it

563
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,798
that yeah enough people that all

564
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,480
commonly agree on it there's always

565
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:59,200
going to be some heads that don't like

566
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
it

567
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,080
for instance my staten island friend

568
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
yeah he was a prickly mother he's a

569
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,960
prickly [ __ ] right so creepy

570
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,798
player

571
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
yeah he's prickly pear and he is not

572
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,480
easy to calm down

573
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,359
so he only likes things that calm him

574
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,440
down

575
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,719
yeah right he's not going to be a sativa

576
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,320
lover he probably doesn't think any

577
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,038
sativas are elites

578
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,599
yeah he doesn't want to get hyped up or

579
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,759
psychedelic or energized or excited

580
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,519
you know he wants to be mellowed out and

581
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,798
so people look for different highs

582
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,918
amongst things

583
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,960
and uh you know and there's different

584
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,799
strokes and

585
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,240
you know to me an elite is just enough

586
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,440
people

587
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,640
right yeah and and the you know

588
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
now there's this whole thing i always

589
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
call them midzie elites right where

590
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,720
everybody with

591
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
modern marketing we wasn't prepared for

592
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,400
modern marketing

593
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,240
no all these companies all these head

594
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
stash all these cali companies all these

595
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,640
different companies everybody has to

596
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,319
have the bomb

597
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,080
everybody has to have elite everybody

598
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,158
has to pump their [ __ ] up everybody has

599
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,599
to use flowery [ __ ] language

600
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
you know and really to me is like what

601
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,439
an elite

602
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,520
is is like people were willing to hold

603
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,519
on to that [ __ ] during prohibition

604
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,599
people trade it people were willing to

605
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,359
hold on to it people cared about it

606
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:17,119
people wanted to like you know uh to

607
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,798
you know and even that a bunch of them

608
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,719
got lost yeah

609
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,839
oh so you might not like something but

610
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,839
if enough people like

611
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,759
i mean for instance you know i don't

612
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,839
like most cookie

613
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,279
yeah you know but there's enough people

614
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,079
out there that love cookie and breed

615
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,678
with it like

616
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,000
you know i might be in the minority in

617
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,759
that regard exactly yeah you can

618
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,599
burn the greatest then it has kind of a

619
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,000
semi-blandish high

620
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,199
you know um and my thing is like i like

621
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,519
highs

622
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,519
yeah people speed that gets me high and

623
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,720
it can be anything from dog [ __ ]

624
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,639
to chem d to dog to

625
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,798
you know i can deal with racy i can deal

626
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,360
with couch lock i can deal with all that

627
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,639
like

628
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,959
i just want it to be potent and

629
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,840
different and if it's a roller coaster

630
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,319
rides

631
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,519
and if it's got terps and and burns

632
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,200
right then that's

633
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,480
me too you know yeah you know um

634
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,679
you know i mean that's the most common

635
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,558
thing is something comes out that's

636
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,559
popular

637
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,359
and then everybody's like oh that guy

638
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,240
sucks or that weed sucks or his weed

639
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,599
sucks

640
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,319
you know because i don't like him

641
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,439
specifically or whatever you know

642
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,359
but that's irrelevant it's like it is if

643
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,159
people use your stuff to breed

644
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,918
you're winning yeah you know whatever

645
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,840
you want to say about neville

646
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,159
you know uh there are a bunch of

647
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,558
cuts that people still hold on to

648
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,360
tightly that come directly from dude

649
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,720
and they're 25 and 30 years old and 20

650
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,639
years old

651
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,038
and and they're still some of the

652
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,880
hardest to get most tightly held

653
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:51,599
cuts still it speaks to itself

654
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,039
you know um you know i basically feel

655
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,038
like

656
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,158
god i don't want to diss people but i

657
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,919
basically feel like

658
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,600
if you're breeding there's like three

659
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,120
ways to like know whether or not you're

660
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,199
a good breeder

661
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:08,239
is like can your stuff pop elites

662
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,720
yeah are there any keepers i would

663
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,759
rather

664
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,839
i would rather have a high ceiling where

665
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,119
there's a percentage of absolute [ __ ] in

666
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,158
the line

667
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,558
than a high floor and a low seal

668
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,960
right so i don't care if there's a bunch

669
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,359
of junk in the line as long as the line

670
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,480
can

671
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,319
produce amazing cannabis yeah

672
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,839
if it just produces a bunch of mids and

673
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,119
none of it's too bad and none of it's

674
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,240
too great

675
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,639
i don't think that's particularly

676
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,359
impressive no it's not personally you

677
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,759
know

678
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,199
like and if someone takes your stuff and

679
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,278
they start breeding with it

680
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,360
that's impressive because that means

681
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,960
other breeders want to use your [ __ ]

682
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,719
exactly it's worth carrying on in their

683
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
lines they find value in it

684
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,000
sure even better than that if someone

685
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,278
wants to take your [ __ ]

686
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,079
steal it rename it try to claim it as

687
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,240
theirs

688
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,678
well then they really like your [ __ ]

689
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,359
yeah that's true

690
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,798
and maybe they steal it and maybe you

691
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,599
don't get any money for it or maybe you

692
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,400
don't get any rep

693
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,959
for it or whatever yeah what did do is

694
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,080
you

695
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,759
undeniably improve the gene pool

696
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,678
and at the end of the day that's only

697
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,038
what [ __ ] matters yeah because at the

698
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,720
end of the day a lot of this no one's

699
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,960
gonna remember a lot of this

700
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,960
like like the amount of people that

701
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
actually know who seattle greg is is

702
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,319
[ __ ] tiny

703
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,600
correct yeah but he's a giant given

704
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,079
the amount of people that remember

705
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,079
neville will be a lot smaller

706
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,038
yeah certain on these things people even

707
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,839
super famous people will be forgotten

708
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,158
you know but their weed lives on they

709
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,599
made a contribution to the gene pool

710
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,840
they improved it they made it a little

711
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,000
cooler you know

712
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,599
and so you know i mean that's just one

713
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,720
guy's opinion i'm just one guy

714
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,278
but i mean you know that's kind of how i

715
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
view it

716
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,440
it's like i like good pot and

717
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,278
essentially what you're looking for

718
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,038
is you're looking for look you know if

719
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,798
you're looking for elites you're looking

720
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,200
for lebron james

721
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,879
yeah you're looking for the one you know

722
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,319
pick a hot supermodel that you're

723
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,440
personally attracted to you're looking

724
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,678
for that

725
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
yeah you're looking for rarity in the

726
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,320
line

727
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,839
yeah it's not very many people that come

728
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,000
out built like lebron james

729
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,519
that have the combination of athleticism

730
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,919
and strength and height and everything

731
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,918
else

732
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,440
you know and it's the same thing with

733
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,240
wheat but it's true it's the same thing

734
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,640
with weed

735
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,599
yeah you know freaking neville says he

736
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,240
grew up thousands of nl5 hazels

737
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,000
yeah over time and the ones that that

738
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,759
are getting traded now are the ones he

739
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
selected out of all those

740
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,000
yeah so many so many good nlp haters

741
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,240
it's probably a bunch of junk

742
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,200
oh i'm sure there's a lot in there tons

743
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,960
you know

744
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,200
and all that um you know so

745
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,240
i mean you know it's it's not easy to

746
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
find elites

747
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,880
you know i mean i did i you know i went

748
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840
to amsterdam in the 90s and i bought

749
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
hundreds of seeds

750
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,278
and i found a bunch of junk yeah you

751
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,840
know

752
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:02,720
the mendo perps i got one female yeah

753
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,119
just happened yeah dog you know he

754
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,519
popped

755
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,798
two seeds in the beginning yeah one of

756
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,000
them became kim sis

757
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,639
one of them became dog yeah boom

758
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,079
two seeds there's only one smaller pop

759
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,200
that's possible right

760
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:20,960
they're right yeah you know two seeds

761
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,880
he got dog boom there you go

762
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,600
you know so sometimes you can hunt and

763
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,200
hunt and hunt and hunt

764
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,439
yeah of course i think that breeding

765
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,038
with air heirloom or land ray strange is

766
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,240
a promising path to finding

767
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,240
elites it just requires a bunch of work

768
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,000
because there's a bunch of junk in there

769
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,919
and you gotta do that junk

770
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,519
like that's the thing is like all the

771
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
stuff we're doing today

772
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,918
it's like you know we're building on

773
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,959
what they did 30 or 40 years ago

774
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,480
so you know um in the beginning there's

775
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
all these different groups breeding

776
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,519
things and then they they made it over

777
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,079
to europe and neville and a couple

778
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,720
others got to combine them

779
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,359
that stuff got sent out to america and

780
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,120
now we're

781
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,879
grandchildren and great-grandchildren

782
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,599
and great-great-grandchildren

783
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,200
but it's all off the work of others you

784
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:11,119
know and it took

785
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,159
um yeah i mean uh scab you know uh

786
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:16,479
scabies on here uh yeah you know

787
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,080
he goes you go that i i watch his feed

788
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,558
he goes through a bunch of sativas a

789
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,879
bunch of

790
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,720
you know he gets a bunch of junk yeah

791
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,399
he'll say i'm sure he'll hop on and say

792
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,319
yeah there's a good amount of junk but

793
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:30,000
then every once in a while

794
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,639
boom that is not junk yeah

795
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,278
fire you know and that fire makes it

796
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,320
worth it

797
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,440
to get all the junk you know i mean

798
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,960
i bought i bought dozens of nl5 haze

799
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,919
seeds

800
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,278
from the era yeah i never found [ __ ] i

801
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,759
wanted

802
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:52,398
yeah but yeah the colorado cough

803
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,519
the piff the heights haze 88 the cuban

804
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,199
black haze

805
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,398
dog [ __ ] hunk the dog [ __ ]

806
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,798
you know those are just the ones in

807
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,759
america yeah correct

808
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,278
nl5 haze like there is not another

809
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,359
hybrid out there that i know

810
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,398
anyone that i know anyone where there's

811
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,439
a there's that many

812
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,278
name deletes that still exist yeah i

813
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
don't either i really don't

814
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,159
literally has double digit named elites

815
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,359
that have survived

816
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,600
both in america and europe and yeah

817
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,959
right there is the only and chem dogs

818
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,959
like cuts like that

819
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,159
that spawned a lot of s one and backseat

820
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,840
or the only other things i could think

821
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,840
that

822
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,759
that's that's like that's that's

823
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,879
different lines and different pops and

824
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,200
different things

825
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
yeah you know nl5 haze was just like

826
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,440
literally one line

827
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,440
yeah that's true it's a very good point

828
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
just one

829
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,120
and it was only it was only there for

830
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,600
what six years or something before they

831
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,639
walked

832
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,918
before they lost the nl5 cup okay before

833
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,080
we start

834
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,080
before we start cutting into our podcast

835
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,519

of those people

other than like stories until way later

858
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,399
um

859
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,399
you know and so uh some of these things

860
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,079
you know i don't have as old of

861
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:58,639
experience with sure

862
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:01,918
um you know uh you know the diesel

863
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,320
um you know more than most of them

864
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,159
um as you know uh i have almost no

865
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,319
personal experience with

866
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,840
sure you know in terms of me actually

867
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,038
growing it some of these things i've had

868
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,119
for forever

869
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,398
yeah and uh you know some made their way

870
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,519
to me relatively late

871
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:22,319
so um

872
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:24,158
uh yes uh bodhi and i are friends

873
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,918
we don't see each other that frequently

874
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,919
but uh we we are buddies yes

875
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,278
so the reason i wanted to bring up the

876
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,919
jesuit was because

877
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,038
it's amazing for me it's where i come in

878
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,278
i have no i

879
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,640
i had an mss cut i am positive it was

880
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,240
fake early on

881
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,399
um i have no experience with mss

882
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,480
itself however what i have a lot of

883
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,119
experience with is the diesel

884
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,120
and the s-ones and i've i've been able

885
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,879
to go through a shitload of the s-ones

886
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,678
uh over the years and out crosses of the

887
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,559
diesel

888
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,240
and see what it is and um through

889
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,918
finally what i talked about earlier

890
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,200
asking skunk va

891
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,640
is this mass skunk cut in this

892
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,440
high times the same cut that you

893
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,840
and not so were growing and he said no

894
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,759
and at that moment i realized

895
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:21,599
[ __ ] jesus might not be directly related

896
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,119
to that super skunk cut like i had been

897
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,639
assuming all these years this is a plan

898
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,239
i've carried with me for a long time you

899
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
know and before me body was carrying it

900
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
for a long time

901
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,639
um and yeah and so

902
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,079
it really changed everything i think i

903
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,120
knew about that plant

904
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,519
uh and i i'm not sure and

905
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,239
at this point we don't know if if diesel

906
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,200
is an

907
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,399
s1 of the mass skunk but we and the mass

908
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,360
skunk may

909
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,599
or may not be uh s1 hybrid of the

910
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,000
original super skunk that was popped by

911
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,918
skunkier's mentor

912
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,119
so yeah that's where we're at yeah i

913
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,440
mean you know it's

914
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,439
um

915
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,518
it's tough because um you know

916
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,519
uh how do i put this in the most

917
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,558
diplomatic way possible

918
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,079
let's just say that you know a lot of

919
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,558
a lot of this history that was being

920
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,759

921

it spread around the way that it does

982
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,119

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,079
that one of the worst forms of evidence

1003
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,119
ever

1004
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,119
is eyewitnesses yeah absolutely

1005
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,880
that they've just proven that people's

1006
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,599
memories are [ __ ] up

1007
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,320
yeah they're not the greatest and people

1008
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,838
can have

1009
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,079
if you've ever had a business partner

1010
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,759
you've ever had a your you ever had a

1011
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,599
grow partner or whatever and you end up

1012
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,440
not liking each other at the end

1013
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,838
both of you have like very different

1014
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,400
opinions of how that [ __ ] started

1015
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,920
sure yeah you know [ __ ] happened and

1016
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,838
whatever happened happened but people

1017
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,800
can have very different mindsets about

1018
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,920
what happened

1019
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,880
yeah absolutely you know and so

1020
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,599
you know i mean um you know maybe that

1021
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,680
gets saved for the podcast or whatever

1022
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
whenever i whenever i poke holes in

1023
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,199
somebody's gig

1024
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,039
you know it's not like to i'm not trying

1025
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,078
to chop anybody down

1026
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,800
it's mostly historical accuracy

1027
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,640
yeah you know rather than like i think

1028
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,000
this person's a liar did you hear not so

1029
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,679
dog he just said that guy's [ __ ]

1030
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,639
scumbag you know but

1031
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,598
you know i don't really yeah you know

1032
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,879
and so

1033
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,880
we don't know when diesel was made no

1034
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,559
we don't know when the seeds were made

1035
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
we don't know

1036
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:15,838
how many years between when the seeds

1037
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,838
were made and when they were popped

1038
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,519
right correct um you know so

1039
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,599
um you know nothing about it actually we

1040
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,920
know uh virtually nothing

1041
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,119
we know that it was called greg's diesel

1042
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,358
yeah that's it

1043
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,358
the diesel and it had some pretty orange

1044
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,639
hairs you know

1045
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,039
yeah you know i mean at some point like

1046
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,960
i mean

1047
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,358
you know matt and i have tried to figure

1048
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,599
out an enormous amount of information

1049
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,799
about haze specifically and it comes

1050
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,119
down to

1051
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,480
the end of the day you know neville has

1052
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,119
a story

1053
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,639
sam skunk man aka david watson has a

1054
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,200
story

1055
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,039
they agree on a large variety of the

1056
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,159
parts there's some parts they don't

1057
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,599
agree

1058
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,319
and there's not very good like external

1059
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,240
evidence

1060
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,359
to like lean one way or the other yeah

1061
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:10,159
so diesel's that way yes we don't

1062
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,279
know when i mean people say day wrecker

1063
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,039
dude

1064
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,960
so i mean the heck we can talk about

1065
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:18,639
that on the podcast or whatever but

1066
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,838
the headband the headbands the sours

1067
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:23,759
that whole family and how all that [ __ ]

1068
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:28,400
works that story is nuts

1069
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,400
that's a [ __ ] even us

1070
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,240
multiple people intimately involved in

1071
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,640
the creation of it

1072
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,598
and being able to pick their brains at

1073
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,639
length

1074
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,680
right yeah like to figure it out you get

1075
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,039
a bunch of info

1076
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,199
but there's still parts where you're

1077
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,599
like oh [ __ ] you know yeah

1078
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,480
but that's not uh that's not easy to

1079
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,000
determine

1080
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,079
and so day wrecker headband

1081
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,760
sour this this this this there's these

1082
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,280
names that are interchangeable

1083
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,880
right same thing with you know um

1084
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,079
the 88 haze the heights haze the pip

1085
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,720
cuban black haze all that like

1086
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,200
those names get used interchangeably but

1087
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,239
they're

1088
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,919
the same cut no and knowing the people

1089
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,639
that know enough of the differences to

1090
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,480
actually say

1091
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,838
this cut is this and this cut is that is

1092
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,519
tiny

1093
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,400
yeah and so so you know uh

1094
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,239
geez you know diesel is i mean it's

1095
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,838
obviously super skunk

1096
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,239
yes that's one thing we know about it

1097
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,400
for sure is that it has

1098
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,598
heavy super scum traits you can look at

1099
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,280
it and

1100
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,280
you know and you can tell that it's

1101
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,920
super skunk yes

1102
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,040
super skunk for people that don't know

1103
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,280
is

1104
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,079
is basically it's a plant called afghan

1105
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,000
tea

1106
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:49,359
which is um

1107
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,519
uh this guy named jim ortega and sam

1108
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:54,799
crossed it or neville crossed it to a

1109
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:58,480
very skunky male he had that he got from

1110
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,880
sam's man and robert connell clark and

1111
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,920
that adding that afghan back to the

1112
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,960
skunk

1113
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,119
created the rankness right

1114
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,760
yeah and that rankness um is unmatched

1115
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,559
you know it really is it really is

1116
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,760
unmatched

1117
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,759
and so you know um

1118
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,079
you know having grown a bunch of super

1119
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,359
skunk myself both the famous cut and the

1120
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,720
seeds

1121
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:28,000
um matt you know matt's cut of diesel

1122
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,319
is undeniably a super skunk female

1123
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,199
correct you know now does it lean away

1124
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,240
from

1125
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,358
the rank skunk yes yes you know it's

1126
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,838
buttery pip pip described it best

1127
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,480
buttery skunk buttery skunk whatever you

1128
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,199
know

1129
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,920
very pleasant so it's in the family you

1130
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,799
know yeah

1131
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,680
um and obviously it doesn't breed very

1132
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,400
easily for

1133
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,838
scoops for super skunk oh man don't call

1134
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,280
it the murder cut please

1135
00:39:53,838 --> 00:40:00,400
oh god please the murder cut no

1136
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,079
um he hates that name he hates

1137
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,240
it i don't even use the word hate in my

1138
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,839
life generally speaking but it's true

1139
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,439
it's a it's not a good name for a

1140
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,039
variety of reasons

1141
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,800
um but uh you know

1142
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:18,639
the um and obviously like you know the

1143
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,480
the the super skunk rankedness might be

1144
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,920
a recessive thing

1145
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,679
you know um you know because obviously

1146
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,039
it hasn't been very easy to find and

1147
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,318
you've done a bunch of hybridized you

1148
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,318
know you've done a bunch of hybrids with

1149
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:34,239
jesus

1150
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:37,358
so it hasn't popped correct you know

1151
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,239
um and uh you know oh it's not foot and

1152
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,318
mouth dude

1153
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,159
that's one of the things where like you

1154
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,519
know like the name of it

1155
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,838
is uh uh

1156
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,000
it's not even like that the the nickname

1157
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,279
of that headband is untrue

1158
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,318
it just got added so much after the fact

1159
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,319
it's very late it's almost a joke now

1160
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,719
within the last few years that that

1161
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,119
nickname got added to that headband cut

1162
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,559
and i would just greatly prefer that we

1163
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,599
pick some other

1164
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:11,199
nickname besides that one

1165
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,440
uh like 56th day

1166
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,799
sorry about the sinking so no we call

1167
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,119
that 56 day

1168
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,800
really right in all in all honesty it's

1169
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,920
not even it's probably a bit longer than

1170
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,400
that yeah it is

1171
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,358
i've never taken a 56. and and it's not

1172
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
headband either

1173
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,039
really so so there's a whole bunch of

1174
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,440
and that that's a whole bunch of

1175
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,480
different things you know so

1176
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,760
there's a few headbands that are renamed

1177
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,880
cushions yes and there's a variety of

1178
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,079
reasons behind

1179
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,280
why that is um the headband we were just

1180
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,839
talking about

1181
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,400
there's a really good reason uh related

1182
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,078
to

1183
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,240
that name that i don't like why they

1184
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,119
renamed it you know there's another

1185
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,239
headband

1186
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,358
that uh you know [ __ ] got renamed

1187
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,799
because

1188
00:41:53,358 --> 00:42:00,400
you know dudes shyster in a way

1189
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,400
um but so

1190
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,440
you know if if people really i mean

1191
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,480
probably

1192
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,039
the closest thing to the original super

1193
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,318
skunk in my opinion

1194
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:14,880
my headband cut that we call the la

1195
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,880
which doesn't always throw super skunk

1196
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,079
terps but at times

1197
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,240
can yeah you can crack a jar

1198
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:27,440
and um you know and then uh

1199
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:30,479
uh you know and then the original sour

1200
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,800
yeah you know the original sour at times

1201
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,039
can

1202
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,000
be skunky depending on how you grow it

1203
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,599
and what you

1204
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,480
how hot it is uh when you pull it 707

1205
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,079
headband is

1206
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,838
is not the cut i'm discussing um 707

1207
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,640
headband

1208
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:50,159
is a strain created by mandelbrot

1209
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:53,838
and he used the the mother of that cut

1210
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:57,358
is the cut i was talking um

1211
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,000
and uh you know so people can't see this

1212
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:00,719
because i can't

1213
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,599
post it but i posted some pictures of

1214
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,358
original

1215
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,440
original sour diesel um right next to

1216
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:11,598
uh skunk va's super skunk cuts

1217
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,280
um and you can you can just i mean you

1218
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,000
can just absolutely see the family

1219
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,400
resemblance

1220
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,599
yeah yeah you know the spears the way

1221
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,160
they form

1222
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,240
you know all that kind of stuff uh you

1223
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:27,838
know it's it's just clearly there

1224
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,838
so she's not lost

1225
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,078
she just got mixed with some different

1226
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,280
things and she does exist

1227
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,280
yeah you know um right now the breeding

1228
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,480
world mostly sucks

1229
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,160
um the people that have the real heart

1230
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,960
are generally speaking doing it in a

1231
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,480
garage or other small areas still

1232
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,720
rooms and things like that and the

1233
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,519
people that have a bunch of money and a

1234
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,439
bunch of time

1235
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,000
and a bunch of [ __ ] in the legal world

1236
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,358
and all the space in the world

1237
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,199
they're not really using that to do a

1238
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,559
bunch of real breeding and isolate

1239
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,199
things and find it

1240
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,119
you might be able to isolate super skunk

1241
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,679
from original sour

1242
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,240
yeah absolutely absolutely it should

1243
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,159
take some

1244
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,239
it should take some time but it would

1245
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:13,440
take time and a bunch of space

1246
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:15,279
you know and uh you know

1247

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,440
in here or whatever but

1265
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:56,239
i've known skunk va for 20 years right

1266
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:59,039
um and he is uh he is not full of [ __ ]

1267
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,838
uh what he knows about uh he knows about

1268
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,639
you know yeah

1269
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,000
and he has been very honest and you know

1270
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,639
and when he made his

1271
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,400
and when when he made his podcast you

1272
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,679
know uh one of our mutual buddies and

1273
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,599
him don't you know

1274
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:12,799
uh you know we don't see eye to eye very

1275
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,079
much anymore

1276
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,440
um and so he listened to it and

1277
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,800
even he had to say you know he was

1278
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,159
upfront and honest about it

1279
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,839
you know and so um you know the dog the

1280
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,318
super skunk the various

1281
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,159
you know cuts and strains that that you

1282
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,719
know he's had access to

1283
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,159
um he is a reliable source on

1284
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,118
information for that

1285
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,598
you know yes very he's a he's he's a

1286
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,519
good dude and he's got love for the plan

1287
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,800
and really what i mean i just told him

1288
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,119
this the other day is like really what

1289
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,640
it boils down to over a long time

1290
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,240
is are you good to people and do you

1291
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,759
have a love for the plan

1292
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,838
yeah people that have a love for the

1293
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,079
plant and a curiosity and a reason for

1294
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,799
knowledge and trying to find that out

1295
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,920
um you know it just it proves itself

1296
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,240
over time

1297
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,960
you know yeah and he's definitely not

1298
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,479
the most

1299
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,240
outspoken of the chem fam in terms of

1300
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,358
history and stuff like that

1301
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:12,000
uh especially before his podcast um yeah

1302
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,519
but he's them he's he's he's reliable

1303
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,480
and he's honest about it you know

1304
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,400
and so um that's because he's a punk

1305
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,159
rocker and he knows what the [ __ ] up

1306
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,079
i mean at the end of the day dude

1307
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,358
there's just you know like lying catches

1308
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,920
up to you

1309
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:26,960
it does it does and i think a lot of

1310
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,400
times when people

1311
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,599
um especially early on were renaming

1312
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,960
relabeling [ __ ]

1313
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,559
it was people that were doing it that

1314
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,079
didn't understand breeding themselves in

1315
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,358
the first place so they didn't know

1316
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,039
that later down the line people were

1317
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,639
going to be able to pop these things and

1318
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,079
be able to see these traits and

1319
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,318
expressions be like oh [ __ ]

1320
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,119
yeah you know so the naming thing is

1321
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:46,800
tough and maybe

1322
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,559
i mean you know it's always hard to

1323
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,240
figure out like you know

1324
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,078
matt and i are we're going to do a

1325
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,598
series of podcasts together or whatever

1326
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,200
and we're going to talk about a bunch of

1327
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,559
history maybe some of you will find it

1328
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,919
interesting or not

um we want to get this out there so

1335
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,119

1336
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,039
against the people that are just um you

1337
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,760

1338
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:17,440
in the sense

1339
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,960
that like i'm not making any money off

1340
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,280
any of this i don't have

1341
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,559
seeds to sell i'm not coming out with

1342
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,800

1343
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,280
have tried to push me matt's one of them

1344
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,000
into like releasing things to the public

1345
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,240
or whatever

1346
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,358
and it's like you know i mean maybe

1347
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:32,959
that'll happen in the future or

1348
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:36,318
something but really what it boils down

1349
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,880
to it's like i uh is you know

1350
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,239
um i just i i want the truth to be out

1351
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,119
there for the most part

1352
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,639
you know and so maybe i'll use a couple

1353
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,720
examples real quick with the time we

1354
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,639
have left so the nickname thing

1355
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,078
it's definitely part of american culture

1356
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,078
and it's cool as hell

1357
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,839
a group of friends they get a cool cut

1358
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,000
they give it a [ __ ] nickname

1359
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:57,199
the nickname sticks it gets passed as

1360
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,239
that nickname

1361
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:03,279
right you know i mean for instance

1362
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,598
um you know uh um

1363
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,079
you know the puck you know the rumor is

1364
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,680
is the puck got the nickname the puck

1365
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,440
because their buddy used to carry it

1366
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,159
around in a hockey puck

1367
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,559
canister yeah like a little bubble tape

1368
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:16,159
thing

1369
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,559
yeah like you'll know the hockey putt

1370
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,159
canisters are these like hard black

1371
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,400
round you know there's like they

1372
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,159
literally just hold the hockey puck

1373
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,680
yeah and he would keep his weed in there

1374
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,159
and so it got named the puck

1375
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,199
you know um when it really is a hash

1376
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,960

1398
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,119
florida in the early 90s before they

1399
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,400
drove it to eugene

1400
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:28,000

1401
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:32,480
is it shortened is it nl5 skunk one

1402
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,920
from neville could be that right

1403
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,960
five nlp junk one is it

1404
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,200
basic five from sssc oh yeah that was

1405
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,599
around a lot

1406
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,639
is it something they bought some hybrid

1407
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,000
they bought

1408
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:50,000
and then it's the five

1409
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,280
yeah you know that could be yeah the

1410
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,318
fifth pop yeah

1411
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,400
i mean the five makes me think that

1412
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:59,039
it's likely an nl it's it's likely an

1413
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,680
nl5 skunk one

1414
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,558
if i had to guess either yeah but but

1415
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,239
that's just an ex

1416
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,920
that's just an example of like in

1417
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:09,519
florida it's one name

1418
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,800
and and eugene and oregon it's one name

1419
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,880
[ __ ] in humboldt it's another name yep

1420
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,160
right another another thing that we

1421
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,880
could do is you know

1422
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,358
um let's talk about the dog [ __ ] right

1423
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,599
yes

1424
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,519
yeah dog [ __ ] had one of the coolest

1425
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,640
names in [ __ ] cannabis

1426
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,159
by far by far one of the coolest names

1427
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,199
an inspired name

1428
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,920
supposedly came out of minnesota

1429
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,318
minneapolis era early 90s it's supposed

1430
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,280
to be an nl5 haze

1431
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,039
and in in minnesota they called it

1432
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,839
electric boogaloo

1433
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,800
that's correct which is a killer name

1434
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,679
right

1435
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,160
uh it gets taken to oregon somebody

1436
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,919
renames it dog [ __ ]

1437
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,440
the worst name it doesn't even smell

1438
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,599
like feces

1439
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,358
the people that passed it out it's from

1440
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,519
oregon so it gets called dog [ __ ] so

1441
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,119
everybody calls it dog [ __ ]

1442
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,358
yeah almost nobody knows it's called the

1443
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,559
electric boogaloo but it wasn't electric

1444
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,279
boogaloo either

1445
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,880
and so what this does okay is for every

1446
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,319
but for everybody that's out there is it

1447
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,838
just makes figuring out the [ __ ]

1448
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,599
lineage

1449
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,358
of what these things actually are and

1450
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,720
what seed companies they came from

1451
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:22,000
really hard yeah it does but he gave

1452
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:24,558
nicknames to [ __ ] right yeah

1453
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,480
and so once you give nicknames to stuff

1454
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,960
then it's like a very small group of

1455
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,280
people

1456
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,400
are gonna know what the previous name

1457
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,319
was

1458
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,240
you know and the only reason why i know

1459
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,318
that snow was skunk five

1460
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,159
is because i literally know the people

1461
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,318
that drove it out in their car from

1462
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:44,000
florida to oregon

1463
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:46,239
yeah well that's creighton too

1464
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,599
those people are that's just luck of the

1465
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,118
draw

1466
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:53,119
right and so you know

1467
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,119
you know those are just two examples you

1468
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,880
know i think i think electric boogaloo

1469
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,039
is an nl5 haze

1470
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,800
starts out as nl5 haze the first crew

1471
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,400
names it electric boogaloo the second

1472
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,119
crew names it dog [ __ ]

1473
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,200
90 of the people that have it call it

1474
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,838
dog [ __ ]

1475
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,879
yeah yeah that's such though i'm really

1476
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,159
i'm gonna push

1477
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,000
back on that i'm calling that [ __ ]

1478
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,118
electric boogaloo from now on electric

1479
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,440
boogaloo is a great name

1480
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,318
you know yeah good snow bee called skunk

1481
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,960
five

1482
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:21,599
you know it got called snow because in

1483
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,119
in oregon

1484
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:29,280
it was white yeah frosty

1485
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:31,200
makes sense yeah you know and uh

1486
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,640
you know yeah i mean you know so that

1487
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,838
kind of stuff happens over and over

1488
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,480
again and so

1489
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,838
what that does is that you know because

1490
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,240
in america and canada

1493
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:46,558
um it obscures the fact that

1494
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,239
the vast majority of it came from like

1495

in the pot in the podcast but i'll say

1545
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,279
when i talked about earlier in the

1546
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:55,358

events um i have a bunch of friends who

1551
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,720
would certainly be considered fair

1552
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:09,920
family and some of my oldest friends why

1553

1556
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,519
podcast that for the podcast but

1557
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,280
it's just it's a play on the dog and

1558
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,960
it's got kind of a silly funny story

1559
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,720
behind it

1560
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,440
um i love that story yeah you know so

1561

i don't know i mean uh i kind of got

1562
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,960
distracted by that question and now

1563
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,480
um oh so urkel you know we'll talk about

1564
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,318
that real quick and you know earlier in

1565
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,000
the podcast i was talking about on the

1566
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:39,838
live i was talking about how every time

1567
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,760
a name strain came along

1568
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,960
that became super popular it crushed

1569
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,079
what came before

1570
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,318
okay so in mendo mendocino county where

1571
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:51,280
i live in northern california

1572
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,199
there was so much demand for purple for

1573
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,880
a number of years that everyone grew it

1574
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:55,679
and no matter how much of it you grew it

1575
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,480
moved

1576
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:01,039
right so i'm literally talking there are

1577
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,559
thousands of growers up here

1578
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,679
that grew urkel then sour becomes

1579
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,599
popular kush

1580
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,679
cookies skittles this that everything

1581
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,720
else now there's like six [ __ ]

1582
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:12,879
that have oracle

1583
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,318
yeah yeah it's crazy it just all of a

1584
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,960
sudden died everywhere

1585
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,639
it you know i mean you know if there's a

1586
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,119
few people that hadn't saved it it would

1587
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:23,920
be freaking gone like the super skunk

1588
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,720
yep and we're lucky that csi saved it

1589
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,559
and loves it

1590
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,639
and decided to breed it into all kinds

1591
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,839
of stuff so it can't be lost

1592
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,679
exactly we went in 15 years from

1593
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,159
literally thousands of people in

1594
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,838
humboldt and mendocino county having it

1595
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,078
to almost no one in either of those

1596
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,838
counties having it it was being sold as

1597
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,318
a clone in almost every collective

1598
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,358
as a and the legit cut was being sold in

1599
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,519
almost every clone

1600
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,440
or collected the clone fast forward 10

1601
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:50,318
or 15 years and nobody cares about it

1602
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,079
because

1603
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,838
you know uh it's not marketable

1604
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,599
currently and yeah

1605
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,880
nine percent of people that had it drop

1606
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,200
it and they grab something

1607
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,640
that's more marketable uh breeders

1608
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,159
syndicates the podcast

1609
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:06,558
it's available on itunes spotify

1610
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,558
sound i don't know and it's coming soon

1611
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,000

1612
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,960
supposed to record it with matt a few

1613
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000

i had some stuff come up it became uh

1615
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,199
you know problematic for me to do it but

1616
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,160
um

1617
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,679
we're gonna keep doing it um uh you know

1618
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:22,960
a lot of you guys probably know fletcher

1619
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:26,480

1622
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,239

1623
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,960
various historical podcasts and in

1624
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,798
various ways shapes and forms

1625
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,199
as much of that history out there as we

1626
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:42,480
can uh that we know about

1627
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:45,039
you know and um and have people

1628
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,318
be able to hear it you know yeah from

1629

someone that's not trying to sell you

1630
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,119
[ __ ]

1631
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,400
so yeah and and it's hard for people to

1632
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,838
research you know even

1633
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,599

info that was up there once

1636
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,279
