00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,629
[Applause]

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,630

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,400
all right shave

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,159
what would we consider the topic tonight

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
uh i thought we i thought we could chat

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,359
a little bit about like just like the

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
like the changing seed dynamic

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,519
and how it's how it's been one way for

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,478
it was you know how every five or ten

20
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,959
years or something it's kind of

21
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,920
dramatically different yeah especially

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,079
since

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
in today's world uh there's a ton of

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,719
stuff now that's coming out

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,200
that's uh you know old and authentic and

26
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,200
this and that and unchanged and you know

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
a lot of people might not know

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,079
that you know even stuff 10 years ago is

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,640
hard to get yeah yeah you know so i

30
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,039
thought we could kind of chat about uh

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
you know what how how how it changed how

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
it started

33
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
and we can take questions on this one

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,438
pretty easy we there's like a lot of

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
years to cover so it's not like you're

36
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,478
gonna be like chronological even or like

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,840
go into tons of depth on everything but

38
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,200
we can kind of give like a general

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
overview you know yeah um

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
and there's already questions about the

41
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,359
the nl repro and hawaiian lights and

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,519
this and that and yeah you know a lot of

43
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,239
people when you hear skunk one or you

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,000
hear nl or you hear this or that or even

45
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,878
sour diesel for some people it might be

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,318
like a legendary thing of old yeah that

47
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,079
you're hearing about but you might have

48
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,839
come up in an era where like it wasn't

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
popular or common

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
you know yeah and so you know there

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
might be a but there's a lot of

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
information out there about certain

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,680
things

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,199
um but you know it kind of gets needs to

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
get taught again and again and again and

56
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,238
again

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
yeah and it seems to be need to be

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
refreshed more often now than ever

59
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,598
before

60
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,959
yeah you know and then

61
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,199
people coming in

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
the information is out there and there's

63
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,079
you know there's i mean there's always

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
been dishonesty in the seed game but

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
there's there's dishonesty and there's

66
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,799
sleight of hand and there's letting

67
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,719
people assume

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
yeah that's a big one assumptions are a

69
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,120
big one where it's not you're not

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
actually

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
you know

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
lying necessarily you're lying by

73
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,238
admission you're just kind of throwing

74
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,039
it out there and being like oh well you

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,840
know

76
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:05,679
yeah you assumed that not me yeah

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,680
so where we want to start

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,719
maybe we could just do like a super

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
quick

80
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,199
overview

81
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,119
uh of what things were like in the uh in

82
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,639
the like in the beginning

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,719
okay go ahead you start with this one

84
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,479
this is your era it's my era so i mean

85
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,239
we've already done some like long

86
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,399
podcasts on this so i won't touch on it

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
too much but the parts that that are

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
important for people to know is that in

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,679
the beginning

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,040
there was only a few companies

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,799
it was all regular seeds uh reversals

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,000
and all that were years and years and

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
years away

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,439
and because there was not very much

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
competition

96
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,318
there wasn't very much pressure to

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,560
change things right yeah so companies

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,479
would come out with a lineup and that

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,479
lineup would often stay the same within

100
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,280
it within a mission or an addition or

101
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,438
two

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,840
over a number of years

103
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,519
um the seed bank from neville changed

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
every couple of years as he figured out

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
what he had going on

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,959
but the first like the first five years

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,719
of scentsy were basically the same stuff

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
unchanged and then every year or two

109
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,158
they'd add a new thing in

110
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,679
you know when simon from serious seeds

111
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,679
came out i mean he was pretty famous for

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,319
kind of having he had like the same six

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
things yeah six just like they did six

114
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,399
things you know um

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
and so that was pretty common back then

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,679
where it was like

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,279
most of the companies that you could buy

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,879
from were out of holland because that's

119
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,679
where it was legal

120
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,279
yeah and they all had printed catalogs

121
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,879
and there wasn't really internet or

122
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,159
internet was very young

123
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:39,120
and so the biggest difference from today

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
is that they all used males

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,478
and so if you look back at that early

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,400
work they typically found

127
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,120
males that worked for them

128
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,079
you know um and repeatedly used them

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
across multiple lines yeah

130
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,240
and you know and

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,639
finding for them it might sound crazy

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
today but like the older breeders would

133
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,240
tell you that like the males were the

134
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,239
most valuable cuts in their stable

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,399
because the females the females you

136
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,839
could obviously grow the flower and you

137
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,478
could decide whether or not you liked it

138
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,159
a bunch yeah the males figuring out

139
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,159
whether or not they pass the traits that

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
you wanted was time consuming

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
it was either that it was either a roll

142
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,560
of the dice and you got very lucky or

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,240
extremely time consuming yeah you had

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,839
you had to like look you had to make

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,038
seeds and grow the seeds and be like oh

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,319
that's not the male i want i'm going to

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,800
go to a different one

148
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,279
so typically breeders when they figured

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
out an actual male that was golden for

150
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,038
them

151
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
they hung onto it like crazy

152
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,639
yeah

153
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,038
right and i i get that one

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
i get that one you know and and so part

155
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,079
of the part of the thing

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
you know we were talking in the

157
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,918
beginning about like olden strains

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
popping back up with the skunk one and

159
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,719
this and the

160
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,478
and the nl and this and that and

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
everything else is that

162
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,318
some of the reasons why these strains

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
were so famous is because unlike today

164
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
where there's like a ton of breeders

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
releasing new names all the time and

166
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,799
they're there and gone

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
um

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,038
these things had lasting power

169
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,879
yeah they hung around

170
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,719
you said that then you

171
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,639
and back then if you bought a seed pack

172
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,919
usually the the following if you chose

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,639
to buy another one the next year it

174
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,758
would be a similar seed pack the same

175
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,680
kind of stuff

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,160
yeah and like even when changed even

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
with the canadians and stuff and other

178
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
companies started biting that initial

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
stuff

180
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,799
they still use those initial names

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
yeah

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
so they got

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,680
you know they got like you know that's

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,600
part of the reason why some of those

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,879
names have such

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
for lack of a better term name

187
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,399
recognition

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
even with casual smokers they might not

189
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,679
have never most smokers have probably

190
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,800
never smoked pure northern lights

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
anything

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,840
but everybody's heard

193
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,439
most it

194
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,439
really haven't honestly probably even

195
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,959
haven't smoked skunk one

196
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,160
yeah pure

197
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,159
you know even though it's in lots of

198
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,479
things but they've heard the name

199
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,599
yeah you know and so uh you know they uh

200
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,199
um

201
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,879
so that was kind of that was kind of how

202
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,079
it was for like a really long time was

203
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,759
that there was

204
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,719
there was different there was different

205
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,879
groups

206
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
and i would say for the first 15 years

207
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,719
it was almost all holland

208
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,598
amsterdam based

209
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,639
yeah

210
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,680
like 85 to 2000 or something yeah it was

211
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
pretty good

212
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,918
it was pretty amsterdam based and then

213
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,478
like in the late 90s early 2000s it

214
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,198
started shifting over to canada too

215
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,639
yeah and there was um you know there was

216
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,680
you know there was a bunch of different

217
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,800
groups from canada federation and uh

218
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,639
uh legends legends and and bbc memory

219
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,680
emory yeah i mean there was even there

220
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,598
was even uh the you know

221
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
one of the cool things about canada was

222
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,478
that before like when i first started

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,319
you either had to fly to amsterdam or

224
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,639
you had to get

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,039
mail from holland

226
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
yeah which was kind of sketch

227
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,560
you know and then there was canadian

228
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
seed companies that started opening up

229
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
in canada and then you could get it from

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,478
canada which was like a lot more

231
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
male back and forth between our two

232
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,839
countries right so it was a lot more

233
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,000
like lost in the shuffle

234
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,519
yeah and so he said mark emery uh the

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
one that was kind of famous for a minute

236
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,758
was heaven's heaven stairway

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,319
yeah um and they were all tied into like

238
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,439
the first forums

239
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
yeah

240
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,478

247
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,359
talked to his brother

248
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
um i'm going to go back to not paying

249
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,639
attention to the comments but yeah i

250
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,399
know i will pay attention soon it's just

251
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,159
hard it's just hard to chit chat and

252
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,958
read at the same time i lose my train of

253
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,159
thought

254
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,599
but yeah like

255
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,120
so

256
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,000
one of the one of the amazing things

257
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,039
about about the canadian seed companies

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
is that

259
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,199
there were individual like companies

260
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
like like scentsy or something that were

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,278
like in canada that were like making

262
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
seeds but there was also like sort of

263
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,958
the first seed brokers

264
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
yeah right

265
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,838
where you know uh in amsterdam days you

266
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,360
kind of went to each individual seed

267
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
company

268
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,600
and got seeds from them

269
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,039
yeah but mark emery or heaven's seven

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
stairway you know these these groups

271
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,480
like you could get

272
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,319
all of that

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
supposedly plus all this stuff from

274
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,278
canada

275
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,279
right and what's important about that

276
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,120
too is that the canadian people it

277
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,639
really kind of like widened what was

278
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,560
available

279
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,799
yeah you know there was different people

280
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
like uh you know reefer man was another

281
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,919
one you know there's various people that

282
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,278
started throwing out all kinds of

283
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,879
different stuff

284
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,439
you know um

285
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,439
you know uh dj short shifted his his

286
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,160
work after not being very happy i don't

287
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,279
think with partnering with with uh dutch

288
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,360
guys

289
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,958
yeah he wasn't too i think he was at sag

290
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,039
martha first

291
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,799
and then he went to dutch passion yeah

292
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,399
um and then he pretty much started

293
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,278
mostly selling his stuff through

294
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,240
canadian companies yeah right

295
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,078
um and that was this is still all

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
males era

297
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,399
but what happened

298
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,480
in the late 90s with with overgrow and

299
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,360
with cannabis world is now all of a

300
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
sudden

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
um like you talk about ig there was the

302
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,399
potential for people to get

303
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560
sort of internet famous

304
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,000
yeah absolutely and there was some

305
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,199
people that were on that were on there

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,278
early on

307
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
that because they i'm not this isn't

308
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,000
dissing them so don't take it that way

309
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,679
but just because there was only so much

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,639
competition and there was only so many

311
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,879
people

312
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,919
like willing to do what they were doing

313
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,879
publicly

314
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,919
um they got kind of famous

315
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,799
yeah

316
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,679
right

317
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,439
yeah you know um the whole first edition

318
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,039
of you know uh

319
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,079
you know people started posting on

320
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,919
overgrow

321
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,919
threads with blueberry i mean

322
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,078
blueberries pretty close to matt's heart

323
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,439
you know and people would freak out

324
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,519
because it looked

325
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,160
so different than anything else

326
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,919
it was wildly different yeah

327
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,078
and that's another part of it where it's

328
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,479
like that's the start of where things

329
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,719
started getting internet famous and

330
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
everybody started talking about them and

331
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
like

332
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
one percent of people that were talking

333
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,240
about them had ever seen it in a bag or

334
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,039
smoked it or smelled it or touched it

335
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
yeah just online vision just online

336
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,719
vision and online talking and so you

337
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,720
could get a couple of people that

338
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,600
sounded intelligent talking about

339
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
something yeah and it was gospel

340
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,200

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
discussion or whatever what's kind of

361
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,759
important about it is that

362
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,000
in the beginning it was literally like

363
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,519
sssc and neville

364
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,839
selling seats

365
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
yeah and then there was like 12 dutch

366
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,440
dudes selling seeds

367
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,278
yeah and then there was like 20 dutch

368
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
dudes selling seeds

369
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,958
and then there was a bunch of canadians

370
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,120
making seed and then there was like some

371
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,159
aggregators of seed in canada selling

372
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,159
seed

373
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,078
yeah and then the internet comes along

374
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,240
and all of a sudden somebody from from

375
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,439
oregon like dj short or you know

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
brothers graham or these different

377
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
people could just pop up

378
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
yeah and there was wait there was what

379
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
was it was breed bay the for what was

380
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
the first

381
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,838
was it was it like probably like direct

382
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
messages in the very beginning which was

383
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,519
the easiest way for people to

384
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
communicate and actually get seeds oh

385
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
yeah yeah

386
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,320
yeah

387
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,240
that's more it goes down in the dm it

388
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
goes down in the dm so

389
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,560
you know the forums the forums was

390
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,039
really the first place where sort of

391
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,719
like the worldwide weed community could

392
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,519
start to chat

393
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,200
yeah

394
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,720
and it's where a lot of legends were

395
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,519
born

396
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,680
you know it's also where the people that

397
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
are legends started writing down

398
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,159
versions of events that we could compare

399
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,360
to what they say and wrote later

400
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,799
yeah so the forums is where a lot of the

401
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,800
real story of skunk one first got told

402
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,240
right yeah the real and we talked about

403
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,319
we talked about it with chem dog on the

404
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,000
last episode it's where people started

405
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
writing down thoughts about chem dog and

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,399
the original story

407
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,399
um

408
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,839
and you know people could find they

409
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,919
could be active on threads and they

410
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,600
could find other people and you could

411
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,599
start learning about sort of like the

412
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,759
larger weed history

413
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
yeah and a lot of times we'd see people

414
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,439
growing the clone and be like [ __ ] i

415
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,519
want that one so you'd go talk to them

416
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,199
and you'd make connections and you know

417
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,278
that's that's how it all worked that's

418
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,120
how the circles started the the clone

419
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,559
circles of people you know kind of

420
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,560
banding together as crews because they

421
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,239
realize like i've got to keep honest

422
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,399
people around me to trade with because

423

um you know and that's where like a lot

432
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,719
of times for some people the first time

00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,719
people saw old-timers start arguing

434
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
with youngsters over what the [ __ ] even

uh who you know um matt interviewed him

442
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,680
and read uh a while ago

443
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,198
uh

444
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,198
you know he he's actually really

445
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,278
personable to watch talk

446
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,439
but he was like the most intimidating

447
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,600
breeder to read about

448
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
yeah because his level of like technical

449
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,639
knowledge and education on how genetics

450
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,199
works is pretty deep yeah it was really

451
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,959
hard to argue with him very hard because

452
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,198
he could he could run circles around

453
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,679
people science-wise yeah i mean he just

454
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,439
he just he's you know he just

455
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,359
breeding and genetics and how all that

456
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,519
stuff works he had a you could call it

457
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
like a classical education in it or

458
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,198
whatever yeah

459
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,039
um you know and he got hella famous but

460
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,559
it's like nobody i never tried any of

461
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,799
his weed

462
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,439
i never tried any of his strains

463
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,719
no yeah i did

464
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,920
but i'm just saying like you know

465
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
something like i said some of the stuff

466
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,039
like with blueberry and stuff like how

467
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,399
many people actually tried the blue

468
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,719
velvet

469
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,159
yeah not many and it was so expensive

470
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
back then it was one of the more

471
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,559
expensive strains for its time you know

472
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,480
so a lot of people weren't buying it

473
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,479
and so the so people would like live

474
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
vicariously through like the people that

475
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,320
did buy it and they'd start a grow

476
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,320
journal on some forum and then

477
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
like that would drive seed sales for

478
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,320
certain ones like crazy

479
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,920
yeah because here's this crazy purple

480
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
blue like long before cookies or

481
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,319
whatever you know uh the blue family

482
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,959
really did look unique

483
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
yeah and so i think we're gonna do a a

484
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,799
whole set segment for people watching

485
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
we're gonna do a whole segment on the

486
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,559
history of purples because i think

487
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
nowadays um

488
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,758
looking around you see all the purples

489
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,759
and you think well this must have been

490
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,399
how it always has been but it just

491
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,639
wasn't like purples were rare as [ __ ] up

492
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,159
until

493
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
2006

494
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,838
2008 you weren't seeing a lot of true

495
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,439
breeding purples that you could you

496
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
could breed with and reliably pass on

497
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,639
purple traits or only a few

498
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,600
and really in 2008 with matt's talking

499
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,839
about

500
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
those purples that started popping were

501
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,040
kind of all descendants from

502
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,639
half a dozen purple cuts that got famous

503
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,399
most of them were descendants of mendo

504
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,519
perps because blackberry is probably a

505
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,360
mendo purp spino and blackberry

506
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,919
the majority were blackberry or purple

507
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,240
oracle yeah so erical and mendo p kind

508
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,799
of created a million hybrids

509
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,558
yeah but you know i i mean

510
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,400
just we're gonna we'll probably yeah we

511
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,918
will do a whole show on that i guess but

512
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,600
yeah we definitely will there's an

513
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
aspect to it where like in general

514
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,399
people should still know that like from

515
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,000
you know so now

516
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
everyone all those people still had

517
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
males

518
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,519
hold on hold on uh roan dog no he will

519
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
never be on this show because he's been

520
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,440
taught too many lies about his [ __ ]

521
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,360
herbal but i'll i'll fill you in later

522
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,519
roan dog

523
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,159
go ahead couldn't let that one slide by

524
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,359
yeah so no i mean like i'm still not i'm

525
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
you know and so

526
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,279
so basically like just keeping it with

527
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,038
the seed game or whatever everyone still

528
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,879
use males

529
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,720
but now it did all of a sudden it was

530
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,760
really it was almost like democracy in

531
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,440
wheat

532
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,240
right yeah there used to be like an

533
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
aristocracy of seed companies

534
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,880
that like they

535
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,880
they didn't have very much competition

536
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
you know and they didn't have very much

537
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
new things coming in to like sort of

538
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
turn the thing so stuff like nl that

539
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,319
gets famous and all was sold for 20

540
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
years

541
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,759
yeah

542
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,160
right like yeah you know i mean skunk

543
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,679
one these you know uh hazes these

544
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
various different things super silver

545
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
haze there was like new things would hit

546
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
like we talked about the white family

547
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,678
and the blue family a little bit last

548
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,919
episode too those things had five or six

549
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,080
years of a run where they didn't have

550
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,240
very much else hypey battling them for

551
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,759
eyes and drool and you know oh my god

552
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,519
what is that

553
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,679
yeah right it was slower

554
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,440
right it was much slower but what the

555
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,400
forums did

556
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
is

557
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
they introduced the ability for

558
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,960
small-scale growers in america

559
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,240
to start selling seed

560
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,519
yeah

561
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,319
for the most part

562
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,160
you really had to like you know um i

563
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,399
mean even for someone like dj short to

564
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
sell his blue line he basically had to

565
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,960
send it to

566
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,959
dutch companies and hope

567
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,558
yeah right when i first started i had to

568
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,079
send it to to

569
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,200
at that time it was mostly british

570
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,439
companies that were doing it and

571
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,519
you had to send it [ __ ]

572
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,080
uh front it all of it you just had to

573
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,558
hope that someone wasn't gonna [ __ ] you

574
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,599
yeah you know and so you and so

575
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:26,879
basically then the internet allowed some

576
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,359
of these seed people to sell direct

577
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
yeah and and to create their own seat

578
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,159
you know

579
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
uh in a way

580
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,080
where that sort of i'm trying to think

581
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
of like who else was

582
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,279
um you know breeder steve got really

583
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,079
famous

584
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,839
in that same era because there was a

585
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,159
thing where you know once they started

586
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,079
changing the laws in holland in 99 where

587
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,640
they didn't allow seed production

588
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,798
switzerland opened up big

589
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
and so there was these there was these

590
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,679
you know there was these forum posts and

591
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,079
stuff about swiss groves

592
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,679
and people like breeder steve and shanti

593
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,759
baba and some of the other people that

594
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
had made the switch over there all of a

595
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,400
sudden like now it's like oh whatever i

596
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,798
see another huge 20 acre grow

597
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,400
yep 500 lights

598
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,000
just scrolling through ig oh look the

599
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
jungle boys are building another [ __ ]

600
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,319
warehouse

601
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,558
but yeah

602
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,399
seeing like seven greenhouses lined up

603
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,558
in a row that were commercially scaled

604
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,798
full of weed in switzerland

605
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:28,240
all of a sudden you were like whoa

606
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,119
yeah it's not in a bedroom anymore

607
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
right

608
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,798
yeah

609
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,880
and they were actually able to breed

610
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,759
over there and so yeah it was kind of

611
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
like

612
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,400
can you think of anybody else besides

613
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,400
like brothers grimm

614
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,200
the dj short breeder steve

615
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,879
you know what i was just thinking as you

616
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,319
were talking was that um what i really

617
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,120
remember was that nobody from europe was

618
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,399
selling direct there were very few

619
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,759
unless you were someone that was a

620
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,759
well-known breeder

621
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,519
you weren't able to buy seeds like from

622
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,038
scentsy you weren't able to buy from

623
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,798
nirvana direct you weren't able to buy

624
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,798
from shanti direct they would not ship

625
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,119
to the us whatsoever

626
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,599
everybody had to go through these these

627
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,839
other venues of the of the one spot

628
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,719
whether it was sea bay heaven stairway

629
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,918
um

630
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,000
onto seed bay you know uh uh seed

631
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
boutique places like that before you

632
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
could even get your hands on them so

633
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,639
nobody was buying direct from the

634
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,279
breeders back then none of them no one

635
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,799
was doing direct seed sales

636
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,038
everybody got sketched by what happened

637
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,639
to neville yeah and so that's what i

638
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,480
mean like i went out in the 90s when i

639
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
was going like you basically most of

640
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,200
them you had to go and get seed

641
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,158
yeah you had to go there and get it

642
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,000
yeah but they weren't they're gonna be

643
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,760
shipping it to you but having stairway

644
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,519
and mark emery in places like that they

645
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,440
would ship

646
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,599
yeah you know and and they and all of a

647
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,440
sudden you could like you'd get cannabis

648
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,519
culture uh which was mark emery's

649
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,279
magazine or height you know and that

650
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,279
that thing was pretty famous i think

651
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,798
most donors bought it because it had

652
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,279
some cool pictures and a few cool

653
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,879
articles but then it would have pages

654
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,319
of his seed company and what the

655
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,919
offerings were

656
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,399
yeah and you would just read those

657
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,000
paragraphs over and over and over again

658
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
yeah there's some good copywriting in

659
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
some of them yeah you're like oh

660
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,558
federation or you know or

661
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,720
casey brains or this or that and these

662
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,759
new names and with new names came new

663
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,480
claims

664
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,480
yeah and new genetics

665
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,558
and you know the the dutch started

666
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,159
losing their their place of like

667
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,240
centrality

668
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,080
yeah you know um but that also started

669
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,120
to speed things up a bit

670
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,279
you know um most famous strains had kind

671
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,519
of an arc of i would call it like five

672
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,639
to eight years where they were dominated

673
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,038
yeah

674
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,159
you know um and i think that was true

675
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:45,919
with like

676
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,200
like i said like with skunk and nl and

677
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,600
it was true with white widow and

678
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,759
blueberry and it was true with

679
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:55,279
you know um i mean you remember all the

680
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,919
hype about like like cindy 99 cinderella

681
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:01,119
oh yeah and like well yeah i mean a fast

682
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,360
fast flowering uh haze supposedly haze

683
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,839
type high that you could grow outdoors

684
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,038
and finish in time it's yeah it's kind

685
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,359
of like

686
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,038
dj used to claim about flow

687
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,879
oh yeah the seven weaker all the

688
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,000
qualities you want in a long running

689
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,080
equatorial sativa found in a seven week

690
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,759
you know yeah seven week plan and so

691
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,678
cindy 99 was kind of the same thing but

692
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,400
it was more like eight or nine weeks

693
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,759
yeah

694
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,679
much closer

695
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,279
much closer and so

696
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,559
um and also we should probably note that

697
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,879
um

698
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,798
whatever whatever

699
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
what's the best way to put it

700
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,038
dms and the internet

701
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,959
really started people

702
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,720
all of a sudden being able to trade

703
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
clones with people they didn't know

704
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
personally in real life

705
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,559
yeah

706
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,158
and i think that was kind of a

707
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,839
revolution

708
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,760
yeah that's that's when a lot of these

709
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,678
cali clones over cali clown only started

710
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,119
to make their way around the nation

711
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
you know because you really had to be

712
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,399
connected

713
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
um you really had to be connected in

714
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,960
order to to get things

715
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,200
yeah you know um and you and generally

716
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,120
speaking like you had to go meet someone

717
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,319
to get them

718
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,158
you know where

719
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,000
all of a sudden i mean it sounds quaint

720
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
now but like people could like go make

721
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,599
internet friends

722
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,038
and do some private dming

723
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,119
and all of a sudden they got some cuts

724
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,240
mailed yeah

725
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,479
that that to me has has

726
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,880
been lost from from what's going on

727
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,440
today for the most part not always but

728
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,200
for the most part a lot of people um pop

729
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
in and expect to

730
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,960
just be given you know just be given

731
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,278
they don't understand

732
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,679
you pay your dues you work you work your

733
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,440
way into certain circles you gain trust

734
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
and this is a several year

735
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,400
kind of thing you know yeah i mean

736
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,479
that's the

737
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,919
i would say that that probably is true

738
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,278
like um

739
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,640
in any like small subculture

740
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:57,440
yeah right like uh um

741
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,880
the the ability for you know for the the

742
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,759
people that are already in it to kind of

743
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,559
lay down the law the rules and like the

744
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,640
the you know what conduct is appropriate

745
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,960
yeah you know um

746
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,640
you know i could use like uh me i'm a

747
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,720
little young for that but

748
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,919
um some of my older dead head friends

749
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,839
told me the worst thing that ever

750
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,759
happened to the dead was when they had a

751
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,959
top 10 hit

752
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,400
in 1987 because so many people

753
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
mindset

754
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
well so many people started coming to

755
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,400
the show that like

756
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,839
95 of the people going there

757
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,519
knew sort of the framework of the rules

758
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,038
yeah and then you get two three four

759
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,400
five hundred thousand people that start

760
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,679
showing up at all these different spots

761
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,360
in different places and they don't know

762
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,038
the rules so much

763
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,839
and the same thing has happened with

764
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,720
weed like there used to be a thing where

765
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,558
i mean

766
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,000
20 years ago there wasn't anybody

767
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,639
offering like hey i've got all these

768
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,319
rare cuts this one's 300 this one's 500

769
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
this one's 800.

770
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,798
like no one would ever trade with you

771
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
if you may if you made a price list for

772
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,639
clones back then

773
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,038
you would probably be blacklisted

774
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
every collector would be like oh no

775
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,599
now people just look at it like oh it's

776
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
a perfectly acceptable business model

777
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,918
yeah

778
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
like i can just gather up all these

779
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,640
clones and i'm not even making a value

780
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,719
judgment

781
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
i'm not saying that back then like that

782
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,400
would have been crazy like you had to

783
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,639
build trust with someone and they would

784
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
usually extract some type of concession

785
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,400
that you would treat it in a way that

786
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,439
they felt was respectful in order to get

787
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,960
it

788
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,519
yeah and if they saw that they probably

789
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,440
wouldn't trust you yeah if you posted on

790
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,440
overgrow or cannabis world or something

791
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,038
like or i see mag later if you posted

792
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
some hey here's the 20 cuts that i'm

793
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,000
selling and here's the price ranges

794
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,759
yeah you'd be [ __ ] you'd be super

795
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,759
[ __ ] you'd be [ __ ] dude and like you

796
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,200
people would be jumping down your throat

797
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,720
people would be

798
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,319
flipping out

799
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,360
because it was it was considered like a

800
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,200
lot of those things were kind of

801
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,558
considered like family heirlooms back

802
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,798
then yeah

803
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,158
you know but what's cool about that is

804
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,119
that that revolutionized breeding too

805
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,200
because

806
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,038
like one of the things that like you

807
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,798
know neville got so lucky when he did

808
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,599
was he got all these american breeders

809
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,200
to just give him their work

810
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,038
and he got across it

811
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,558
right so that was very lucky in that

812
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,558
sense because it's like

813
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,399
he got to cross skunk and nl and he got

814
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,278
to cross hayes and then allen he got to

815
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,798
cross

816
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:23,119
you know all this [ __ ] so yes dms and

817
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,200
trading that went on in the forums

818
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,519
that started really like

819
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,919
changing up what what growers and

820
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,319
breeders could have access to

821
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,399
yeah and what they could use and people

822
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,720
mailing each other seeds that was even

823
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,678
more that was way more common

824
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
than

825
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,640
i think clone trading oh yeah for sure

826
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,960
way way more common like clone trading

827
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,720
was still pretty rare and sketchy but

828
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,679
people would be like oh i took this i

829
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,200
took this uh sweet tooth

830
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,559
and i crossed it to these eight things

831
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,558
that i have and now i have seeds i'm

832
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,480
gonna send them to all my friends

833
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,038
yeah clone mailing is also a huge pain

834
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,880
in the ass and it always it has been you

835
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,640
know it happened

836
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,360
it was just super rare in my opinion

837
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,919
then yeah it did happen

838
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,839
but i think trading seeds was more we

839
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,200
were still like in this in the you pop

840
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,240
seeds era

841
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,720
yeah yeah definitely don't you think

842
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,558
yeah oh yeah yeah i mean i just think i

843
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,558
think in general

844
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,398
sending clones was so much labor so much

845
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,240
more laborious there were so many there

846
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,319
were so few people that had legit [ __ ]

847
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,798
and it was easier to track who had what

848
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,079
back then than it is now

849
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,319
so there were there were all kinds of

850
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,839
factors that went into why seeds were

851
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,158
much easier to ship and why they were

852
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,398
more traded than clones and there's more

853
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,360
emphasis on seeds back then anyways than

854
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,199
clones market wise too i think before

855
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,240
the mid 2000s

856
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,319
um there was a lot less emphasis on like

857
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,759
i have this specific strain and it sells

858
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,759
for this much

859
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,798
yeah you could grow a lot of good things

860
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,119
and it would still easily sell

861
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,720
yeah right so people were much more they

862
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,319
were much more content with like oh send

863
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,360
me 30 seeds and i'll find a winner and

864
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,839
then i'm going to grow up my little

865
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,639
group and i'll have no problem moving it

866
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,798
yeah

867
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,600
that was a big issue too

868
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,440
you know is is that as the last the last

869
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,158
15 years it's gotten more and more and

870
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
more specific on do you have this cut

871
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,200
yeah

872
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,798
where i think that arrow that we're

873
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,440
talking about it was more people were

874
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,359
way more into like finding seats

875
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
yeah i think in that era you are more

876
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,199
likely to get

877
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,080
a real cut because the the whole fake

878
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,319
cut thing hadn't really taken off yet

879
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,079
well no there was there was no nobody

880
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,558
sold any so there was no money in it so

881
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,119
there was no reason to deceive and like

882
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,119
there was fake cuts getting traded

883
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,519
but like anything else it takes a long

884
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,879
time for that stuff to snowball

885
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,879
oh yeah because you have someone has to

886
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,080
grow it out figure it out that it's fake

887
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
in the first place go through enough

888
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,319
hands to be caught

889
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,839
sure and in some cases it's like so you

890
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,439
got a fake or two or whatever like

891
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,759
getting traded back and forth here and

892
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,080
there to one or two people and then fast

893
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,240
forward 10 years and the game changes a

894
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,918
little bit and there's 30 people

895
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,720
trading that cut

896
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,880
yeah so just get into way more hands

897
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,440
i was always honestly like that's more

898
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,600
matt's era than mine in the sense that i

899
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,360
was way more of a lurker

900
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,959
because i didn't trust technology

901
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,199
he's a like

902
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,278
to i didn't trust technology to dm

903
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,519
people and to give out my address

904
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,759
and to have yeah

905
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,440
i was stupid i was i was in the era

906
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,278
where people still weren't selling

907
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,558
direct and i'm like how the [ __ ] are

908
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,798
people selling direct i'm just gonna

909
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,759
sell direct and it was probably

910
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,839
a very very risky idea and i didn't

911
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,759
realize it at the time how indeed risky

912
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,879
it was i figured more people would do it

913
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,200
than me

914
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,840
i did super risky [ __ ] i just i just

915
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,278
like i just didn't understand like i

916
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,158
thought like with the push of a button

917
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:55,200
the fbi could just find my vpn and

918
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,720
everything they're all male phobic

919
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,640
i don't like it but i mean i would do

920
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,640
things like i would go to amsterdam you

921
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,679
know and i would like put

922
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,240
seeds sew them in the hem of my jeans

923
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,840
yeah like twice a year

924
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,159
and like and i would make these like

925
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:13,599
tiny little notes with like like prison

926
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:17,440
notes like the smallest lettering like

927
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,278
and nl5 skunk one this tiny little note

928
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,519
and i'd slip that in the hem and then

929
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,119
i'd push the 30 seeds in there and sew

930
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,440
it back up

931
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,278
you know so that's like actual like

932
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,960
smuggling in a way you know i was just

933
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,720
thinking how bad it would suck like if

934
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,480
you got home and you forgot to tell your

935
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,159
mom not to wash your jeans

936
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,759
oh yeah washes your jeans with your

937
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,240
seeds

938
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,319
when i was buying i i moved out uh soon

939
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,159
you know uh early on yeah there wasn't

940
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,079
uh there wasn't any like come home with

941
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,159
illegal seeds to my mom

942
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,480
um but yeah that was

943
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
and your significant other we used to

944
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,960
get really annoyed about

945
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,558
like the last day you were in amsterdam

946
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,319
you would like take

947
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,158
you would get a new hotel room and you

948
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,319
would take everything in your bag out

949
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,600
one by one and you would look for like

950
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,678
weed leafs

951
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,918
or something yeah or a small chunk of

952
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,200
hash you would make sure you laundered

953
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,120
all your [ __ ]

954
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
right like yeah uh

955
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,119
you know i have a buddy you know um i've

956
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,080
talked about him before but

957
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:19,278
um you know he had a he had a wallet

958
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:22,879
right and the wallet had a velcro seal

959
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:26,000
and like the tiniest flake of weed was

960
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,440
sticking to the velcro

961
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,200
and when he went through customs they

962
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
look through his [ __ ]

963
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,798
they find it yeah and all of a sudden

964
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,079
they're like what is this and there's

965
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,440
like the tiniest tiniest flake of

966
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,879
you know it was like a sweet leaf that

967
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,480
was stuck to the bud yeah and then it

968
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,919
stuck to the velcro

969
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,519
well that was like we had a two-hour

970
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,799
delay because then they ripped apart

971
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,480
everything in his life and they like

972
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,079
looked at the souls of his shoes and

973
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
they like imaged the bottom of his

974
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,319
suitcase i mean it was like they were

975
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,120
they were on him like white on rice i

976
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,599
bet

977
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,199
from one little flake

978
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,719
you know and then back then we were

979
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,319
sketched enough because you were flying

980
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
home sometimes we would do this thing

981
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,439
where

982
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,239
we would go to holland but we would fly

983
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,558
home from like germany or belgium or

984
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,640
france oh yeah yeah so at least there

985
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,158
was like a direct flight not necessarily

986
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
straight from amsterdam

987
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,720
yeah because you're going to be looked

988
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,639
at way more heavy coming out of

989
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,079
amsterdam sure yeah just because it's

990
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,399
like yeah it's like you're flying home

991
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,759
from like

992
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,479
yeah you know it's like it's like in the

993
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,319
80s you're flying home from bogota yeah

994
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,839
and you're doing exactly big sunglasses

995
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,119
you know like you might get looked at

996
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,959
for a minute you know because it's

997
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,759
bogota you know

998
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,000
so it it uh

999
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,200
you know it basically like it took a lot

1000
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,839
of effort

1001
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,519
then and the and i think the forums

1002
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,038
really sort of like democratized and

1003
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,038
made the effort easier because you could

1004
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,558
like hunt [ __ ] from your living room

1005
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,200
yeah

1006
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,038
you know and unlike today i mean i've

1007
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,519
like we i've made some comments before

1008
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,640
about like ig being irritating me

1009
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,558
because

1010
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,399
you know people curate their page so

1011
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,119
hard that a lot of good information gets

1012
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,798
lost yeah because people will just block

1013
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,719
you or delete your comment or even just

1014
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,000
take down the whole post

1015
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,159
if the you know it goes off it goes off

1016
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,719
kilter for them yeah right yeah

1017
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,720
you know even my my catalog posts have

1018
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,039
been flagged and taken down just

1019
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,638
pictures of cat pages from catalog so

1020
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,719
people have access to see what was in

1021
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,200
the catalog even those get reported and

1022
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,319
taken down you know so in the early days

1023
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,638
the only way that you could get

1024
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,280
something taken down on the forum is if

1025
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,559
the moderator you knew the moderator and

1026
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,960
they were willing to do something shady

1027
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,398
and get rid of it yeah back in the day

1028
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,398
the worst thing that used to happen on

1029
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,559
the forums was if people got too mean to

1030
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,319
each other they would just lock comments

1031
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,918
yeah lock the thread they would just

1032
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,800
lock the thread but the thread the

1033
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,480
information itself would stay up there

1034
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,839
so i think there was like a generation

1035
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,358
of people

1036
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,320
that grew up

1037
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,719
um

1038
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,399
you know and i mean i i talked i've

1039
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,118

1045

1061
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
that's where we met

1062
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,078
yeah

1063
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
and it was the internet and then there

1064
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,240
was people like uh like chip who started

1065
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,240

1068
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,519
royal gold from

1069
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,039
royal gold he has a podcast now and i

1070
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,960
think he's in colorado or something like

1071
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,199
that that's what i heard but anyway like

1072
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,280
i you know i met chip there and he you

1073
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,879
know he was just back from

1074
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
uh switzerland

1075
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,960
yeah and he had a bunch of you know

1076
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,800
pictures of all these greenhouses full

1077
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,880
of weed

1078
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,280
and so it was like those kind of things

1079
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,559
brought together a bunch of breeders

1080
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,200
yeah right

1081
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,960
and that is what really started like the

1082
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,799
poly hybrid era where people started

1083
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,679
being able to trade their stuff back and

1084
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,920
forth

1085
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,358
yeah and start crossing things to

1086
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,800
different things and oh i've got this

1087
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,880
little bit because most of the time back

1088
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,320
then you got two or three cuts that your

1089
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,119
friends grew

1090
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,519
yeah

1091
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,119
and that's all you had access to yeah

1092
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,280
and then maybe

1093
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,519
you know it's like yeah like if matt was

1094
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,320
if matt was growing in san diego or some

1095
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,199
[ __ ]

1096
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,800
then he could get things in san diego

1097
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,879
yeah but he wasn't going to get things

1098
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,880
that were famous in new york or florida

1099
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,640
or that wasn't that easy

1100
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,640
yeah not during that era not during that

1101
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,319
era at all it wasn't that easy

1102
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,000
and so you know matt made the point now

1103
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,400
where people like want access to all

1104
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
this stuff really fast

1105
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,119
yeah and they don't realize how many

1106
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,359
years

1107
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,320
of just being around and being trusted

1108
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,440
it took

1109
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,519
before

1110
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,599
someone would start to let you in

1111
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,679
i take i compare it a lot to like if

1112
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,480
people are familiar with tattoo shops

1113
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,239
how

1114
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,719
when you want to be a tattoo artist the

1115
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,399
first place you start is with the broom

1116
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,799
you start with the broom

1117
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,160
and you sweep the tattoo parlor and you

1118
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,720
can do this for

1119
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,440
six months to [ __ ] 10 years

1120
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,039
it's uh it's all based on when you gain

1121
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,480
the trust for someone to take an

1122
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,000
interest in you and be like i'm going to

1123
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,679
show you a trade because i think you're

1124
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,440
worth worth showing this to and i'm

1125
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,440
going to invest time in you and you're

1126
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,838
going to return that by helping me you

1127
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,920
know apprentice you know it was a much

1128
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,358
more of like an apprentice situation in

1129
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,559
in a lot of these things when it came to

1130
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:51,838
trust i and i think too that was how

1131
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,719
seeds work yeah i mean if you go back

1132
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,679
um

1133
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:58,000
you know uh why did you know after

1134
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,000
neville left uh scentsy for instance why

1135
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,320
did he partner with shanti

1136
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,079
yeah uh shanti was probably younger and

1137
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,519
more vigorous

1138
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,280
you know he kind of took him under his

1139
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,880
wing there was a lot of that that

1140
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,960
happened there was a lot of people that

1141
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,640
trained people coming up

1142
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,240
yeah you know and you learned from

1143
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:18,639

1174
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,519
forums

1175
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,159
uh the of overgrow for instance yeah and

1176
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,559
all of a sudden sam skunk man's on there

1177
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,719
yeah and tom hill's on there

1178
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,480
and chimera is on there

1179
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,719
and like guys that are like real good at

1180
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,039
what they're up to yeah and know a lot

1181
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,799
and are opinionated and you know or and

1182
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,159
they're fighting amongst each other over

1183
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,160
who's what

1184
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,719
yeah battling over this or that but in

1185
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,639
those battles you get to see like well

1186
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,519
here's why i believe this

1187
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,199
yeah

1188
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,759
you know and you could read that stuff

1189
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,559
and you could get a lot more educated

1190
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,920
yeah

1191
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,960
you know

1192
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,680
um

1193
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,358
and so you know yeah you learn from you

1194
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,358
learn from observation you learn from

1195
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,358
someone teaching you you learn from

1196
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,639
reading and various sources i mean

1197
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,559
someone asked me

1198
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,039
uh earlier today like you know what's

1199
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,318
the what's the go-to how if i want to

1200
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,358
start breeding where would i want to

1201
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,000
learn

1202
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,440
i told you i'll go to marijuana botany

1203
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,480
yeah yeah that's that's what i always

1204
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,559
tell everyone when it comes in here

1205
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,760
marijuana first place if you want a

1206
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,920
primer

1207
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,920
rob clark did a real good job of laying

1208
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,720
out all the basics so you might i don't

1209
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,800
think anything's come close even remote

1210
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,039
like there's greg green's breeders bible

1211
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,680
all that and respect to him but i don't

1212
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,159
think anything's come close uh to robert

1213
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,679
clark's um marijuana botany even though

1214
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,759
it's outdated

1215
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,759
it still has so much info that is never

1216
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,160
going to be outdated in it

1217
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,000
it's it's like it really is a true bible

1218
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,000
if you want the basics

1219
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,318
and you want the terminology and you

1220
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,760
want how the [ __ ] works and you know

1221
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,519
yeah obviously it was written a long

1222
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,200
time ago so things have advanced in

1223
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,559
certain ways but like

1224
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,000
um it's still a really good core

1225
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,838
core thing to learn

1226
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,679
sure um and that's and that's you know

1227
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,799
that you know so the other part of it is

1228
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,000
like people should probably realize that

1229
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,760
um

1230
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,079
when people

1231
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,079
uh which did you call it with with red

1232
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,079
and camaro the shotgunning method matt

1233
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,318
yeah yeah the shotgun scatter method the

1234
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,200
mailman you take some males you're like

1235
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,639
these males look good to me

1236
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,318
i'm gonna throw them on these plants and

1237
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,239
see what happens sometimes you use one

1238
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,519
sometimes you use five

1239
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,598
yeah and then you'd have to grow up a

1240
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,039
bunch of seed and be like which ones

1241
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,318
have the traits in them that i want to

1242
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:33,039
do for the next round yeah

1243
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,519
you know um and so we it was kind of

1244
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,279
more i think 20 years ago it was a lot

1245
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,358
more traditional breeding

1246
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,359
yeah you were forced

1247
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:46,000
to take multi-stage breeding yeah

1248
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,279
for the most part yeah

1249
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,480
you know

1250
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,519
um yeah and and you know and so

1251
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,000
you know

1252
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,480
uh you know someone mentioned subcool or

1253
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,838
gypsy nirvana i mean yeah the general

1254
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,079
point is that

1255
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,719
more and more people started being able

1256
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,318
to offer seeds to the public

1257
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,078
yeah whether they were making their own

1258
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,239
seeds whether they were middle manning

1259
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,480
seeds from other people

1260
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,078
you know there started to be a wider

1261
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,240
variety of places where you could

1262
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,839
actually get them yeah

1263
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:21,838
i mean it started off with two

1264
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:23,358
right sorry bryn's doing a dance for me

1265
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,599
you went from you you used to have to go

1266
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,159
to amsterdam and and that's part of the

1267
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,039
reason why like ssse

1268
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,000
and neville met all those important

1269
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,920
people

1270
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,079
yeah because they were the only people

1271
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,159
doing what they did

1272
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,200
so all these interested parties whether

1273
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,559
it's seattle greg or sam skunkman or rob

1274
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,358
clark or

1275
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,480
um

1276
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:49,039
jim ortega they all met the same dudes

1277
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,800
yeah because there's two of them

1278
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,400
right and then there was 10 and then

1279
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,440
there was 20.

1280
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,039
and so

1281
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,838
some cool was a lot of people's first

1282
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,920
breeder disappointment

1283
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,000
yeah um you know

1284
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,480
there's a there's a there's a phrase uh

1285
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
that's used a lot not not in cannabis

1286
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,599
but just in general which is don't get

1287
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to know your heroes

1288
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,680
yeah you know it applies to music it

1289
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,760
applies to art it applies to a lot of

1290
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,118
things sometimes your heroes the more

1291
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,800
you get to know them the more you're

1292
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,119
impressed by them

1293
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,119
yeah sometimes it's

1294
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,280
you're like oh my god how did why do

1295
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,640
people think this way about this person

1296
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,240
yeah

1297
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:30,960
you know um and uh

1298
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,679
you know and and and so you know because

1299
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,079
see seeds have always been shady

1300
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,679
always you know they're beans they all

1301
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,760
look just like some you know i mean they

1302
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,519
don't have that much variation in them

1303
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,119
yeah they look like seeds some of them

1304
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,119
were tire strikes some of them are pale

1305
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,559
some are big some are small

1306
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,800
but it's like you know you buy these

1307
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,400
things and you don't know what you get

1308
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,318
for months

1309
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,680
yeah and then it was all prohibition so

1310
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,159
what are you gonna like there's no like

1311
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,559
you're not gonna leave a bad yelp review

1312
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,199
yeah jumping online on amazon and being

1313
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,559
like this [ __ ] bag [ __ ] i i suppose

1314
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,159
you know like you didn't you were just

1315
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,759
like you told your friends and that was

1316
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,598
bunk

1317
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,200
but like there wasn't you know like the

1318
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,838
forums were the first place that people

1319
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,199
started to talk back and forth amongst

1320
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,039
like what'd you find

1321
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,480
yeah

1322
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,639
right

1323
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,639
yeah

1324
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,239
what'd you find you know and so it's

1325
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,838
always been it's always been a little

1326
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,239
bit rough because

1327
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,920
uh you know i talked about it on a show

1328
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,358
earlier too where people like shanti and

1329
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,960
others all those people in the second

1330
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,960
generation

1331
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,358
they decided to start hiding the lineage

1332
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,358
of what they used

1333
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,358
because they didn't want all their

1334
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,318
competitors to just copy them

1335
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:41,759
yeah

1336
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,800
i have been trying to figure out what

1337
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,160
the exact parents are of ak-47

1338
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,280
since

1339
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,639
ak-47 popped up in the mid-90s

1340
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,040
you know and

1341
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,639
i did invite

1342
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,519
uh simon on to talk about

1343
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,920
that

1344
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,440
um and and luke from paradise simon said

1345
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,720
he would but luke from paradise is

1346
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,159
another one where you just don't know

1347
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,639
what the genetics are in any of his

1348
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,480
lines but he's made some really awesome

1349
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,000
lines scentsy star

1350
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,280
yeah who knows

1351
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,960
who [ __ ] knows i mean there's

1352
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,720
theories about it being a big sur holy

1353
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,960
weed cross all kinds of different [ __ ]

1354
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,279
there's all kinds of theories and they

1355
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,119
don't know because neville and and

1356
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,560
carell from sssc didn't have any

1357
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,760
competition they were just like this is

1358
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,279
this and this

1359
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,040
yeah this is how i got it this is where

1360
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,400
i got it this is what i did with it yeah

1361
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,559
this came from a guy in new york in a

1362
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,400
bad seat here yeah this came from this i

1363
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,000
bought these two cuts in oregon

1364
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,519
and that's how i got the g13 and this

1365
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,760
hash plant you know

1366
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,559
yeah and then the second wave

1367
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,160
they all obscured most of what they were

1368
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,759
using and why

1369
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,598
yeah and maybe they did it for

1370
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,920
competitive reasons

1371
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,079
but for like historians or people really

1372
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,920
wanting to know the lineage

1373
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,760
uh i don't know how many hours matt and

1374
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,519
i and a group of our friends have spent

1375
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,520
trying to figure out what's we've

1376
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,280
scoured everywhere

1377
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,838
looking for lineage on some of this

1378
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,240
stuff oh yeah and you get hints here and

1379
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,639
there but it's never anything you can go

1380
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,799
off of even if you can track down the

1381
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,879
original quote-unquote breeder or person

1382
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
who relates release the seeds

1383
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,838
nine times out of ten you're still not

1384
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,160
going to know at the very end just

1385
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,559
because so the nature of how they remain

1386
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,358
back then people say cherry ak

1387
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,838
um

1388
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,679
you know ak was a very it had a great

1389
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,920
name for the time

1390
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,078
simon only sold six things

1391
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,440
um and you know probably four of them

1392
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,480
were pretty fire

1393
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,519
yeah uh

1394
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,400
and uh it you know and it's um

1395
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,599
you know there was a sandalwood ak in

1396
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,160
um

1397
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,720
in colorado uh matt's done a bunch of

1398
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:45,039
work with the cherry ak

1399
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,959
i had a lemon ak for quite a while too

1400
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,800
that we did work with there's the rc

1401
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,039
cola ak

1402
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,960
back in the day yeah it doesn't i mean

1403
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:54,239
even like uh who doesn't like nebu or

1404
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,920
something like that get all upset and

1405
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,879
say no one else could have a cherry ak

1406
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,200
but him

1407
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,800
yes which is preposterous because if he

1408
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,639
found it in seeds of ak-47

1409
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,560
it obviously can pop

1410
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,639
well i mean he says

1411
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:12,799
technically he says he owns

1412
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:15,440
he owns cherry liqueur ak-47 but he owns

1413
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,280
also all of cherry ak-47 that no one

1414
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,559
else has a right to use the name is what

1415
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,480
he says yeah

1416
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,880
obviously it's just a flavor profile

1417
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
that pops up in that cross yeah so it's

1418
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,680
like pretty hard to like

1419
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,559
be like i'm i'm trademarking this this

1420
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,118
terp

1421
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,599
it wasn't even his strain but no you

1422
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,559
know like i'm the first one that came up

1423
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,720
um

1424
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,359
and uh you know and so

1425
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,759
you know he had but what's in cali mist

1426
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,759
what's in the only one i think he

1427
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,160
actually said that you knew something

1428
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,599
was he had white russian yeah white

1429
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,039
russian that's right

1430
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,119
you knew half of it because it was white

1431
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:55,759
widow by ak-47 yeah you know

1432
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,760
um but aka and kali and some a lot of

1433
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,640
these different things like people start

1434
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,440
obscuring what's actually in stuff

1435
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:02,879
yeah

1436
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,838
you know or

1437
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,119
they started taking famous

1438
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:08,880
names you remember when who was who was

1439
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,079
the who was the group uh

1440
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,400
um that claimed to have nl9 in canada

1441
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,559
oh i don't know on that one i remember

1442
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,119
nl6 from kenny from trichome

1443
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,839
technologies that wasn't related to nl6

1444
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,079
yeah so there's so and you know

1445
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,440
that's the thing now is that

1446
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,800
you know we talked about todd a little

1447
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,760
bit or whatever but there's people that

1448
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,039
are popping up with these 80s and 90s

1449
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,000
seed lines

1450
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,480
yeah

1451
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,838
and the names are so famous

1452
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,639
neville did say

1453
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,679
uh collie missed his nl5 haze

1454
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:44,159
uh but then neville was bitter and very

1455
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,318
i liked neville i liked neville i mean

1456
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,358
he's a neville stan is what we call them

1457
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,358
yeah but

1458
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,358
neville was famous for being bitter and

1459
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,400
saying everybody in holland everything

1460
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,318
was from me

1461
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,599
yeah they all ripped me off

1462
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,279
and that happened when he came back

1463
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,280
about nobody had nobody had anything

1464
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,680
nobody had anything original and yeah to

1465
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,559
his to his credit i will say

1466
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,239
um

1467
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:08,559
you know adam and simon and uh and tony

1468
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,719
left his company and started their own

1469
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,760
seed companies yeah and all of a sudden

1470
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:15,759
had a bunch of lines really fast yeah

1471
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,960
so it's a little sus

1472
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,480
yeah

1473
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,760
yeah that was probably right that his

1474
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,240
stuff is in

1475
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,920
a lot of what's around it doesn't mean

1476
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,118
it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean

1477
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,559
that like

1478
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,720
all the stuff

1479
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,519
that they used was from him

1480
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,759
yeah

1481
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,519
but they probably took some stuff

1482
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,440
yeah probably even

1483
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,800
probably even some breeding males you

1484
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,559
know what was always interesting to me

1485
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,880
about the whole um

1486
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,720
hidden lineage type thing was that if

1487
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,760
these guys were super

1488
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:49,838
super well schooled breeders they would

1489
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,599
have known that even if the people had

1490
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,679
had the recipe let's say they just had

1491
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,119
the generic recipe of white widow crust

1492
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:56,799
the blueberry from blue widow and

1493
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,480
they're like ha we figured it out they

1494
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,440
could never remake it the same unless

1495
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,280
they had the exact same clowns sure

1496
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,200
it just didn't make any sense to me that

1497
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,200
they would ever hide the lineage but

1498
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,598
that yet it did happen

1499
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:11,358
pot of gold is fire someone's kind well

1500
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,960
i looked at the comments yeah um pot of

1501
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,440
gold and uh

1502
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,760
and the real mccoy were my two favorite

1503
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,920
lines from the flying dutchman

1504
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,800
yeah one of them was hawaiian by skunk

1505
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,880
one and the other one was a hindu kush

1506
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,400
by skunk one yeah i have a bunch of the

1507
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,079
real mccoy i think that's the hawaiian

1508
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,160
one it's the hawaiian one yeah they were

1509
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,519
really good um

1510
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,318
you know and so

1511
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,639
yeah they uh um

1512
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,639
they were like the reason why

1513
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,519
the reason people someone just asked how

1514
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,440
come

1515
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,719
a bunch of the other nl numbers aren't

1516
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,358
famous

1517
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,279
um it's because after three or four

1518
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,598
years of breeding with them

1519
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,839
neville decided to use the one the two

1520
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,640
and the female cut he found of the five

1521
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:57,920
basically and that's it yeah so the

1522
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,480
three four six seven eight nine 10 11

1523
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,838
um they just weren't sold

1524
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,838
yeah

1525
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,078
you know they weren't sold

1526
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,400
um and greg only seattle greg he really

1527
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,920
he only sent them to what he told what

1528
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,838
did he tell us he said he sent them to

1529
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,039
neville and the drunkers

1530
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:14,880
yeah

1531
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,639
so there was basically only neville and

1532
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,800
then scentsy

1533
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,239
yeah and sensei just ran with what

1534
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,800
neville had already discovered at the

1535
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,199
seed bank yeah

1536
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,318
so you know um

1537
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,318
you know and so that's kind of where

1538
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,679
they went is that and it makes sense

1539
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,599
because if you think about it from

1540
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,598
neville's perspective i mean he always

1541
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,280
used to joke that he could be like

1542
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,519
i'm gonna release the most fire line

1543
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,359
ever and someone's like oh i found two

1544
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:40,800
bananas and it didn't yield as much this

1545
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:41,679
line sucks

1546
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,119
yeah

1547
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,598
sucks ass

1548
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,838
right and so even back then the people

1549
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,800
felt pressure from consumers

1550
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,639
yeah

1551
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,480
yeah and so

1552
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,879
you know people like to breed with stuff

1553
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,159
that makes happy customers

1554
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,519
yeah

1555
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:02,239
you know nl's 6 7 8 9 10 11 or whatever

1556
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,400
that were all like like messes of afghan

1557
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,078
and and sativa

1558
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,000
they probably were a big mess and a pain

1559
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,680
in the ass

1560
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,119
very likely he said that he was using a

1561
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:13,679
lot of indians

1562
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,039
mexicans colombians mixed up in that in

1563
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,799
that bid so there's going to be some

1564
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,558
wild [ __ ] that just wasn't good that

1565
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,519
they crossed it i mean even today most

1566
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,200
people don't want to grow something

1567
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,519
that's longer than nine or ten weeks

1568
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,358
yeah exactly you get some nl10 or

1569
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,559
whatever and you grow it and it takes 13

1570
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,558
weeks and you [ __ ] can it

1571
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,000
you know

1572
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,519
most people would still do that today

1573
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,519
yeah i would think so

1574
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,199
just because it's like it it

1575
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,639
you know and so

1576
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,598
um

1577
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,199
that i don't know like it

1578
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,720
and so then maybe we should we should

1579
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,960
talk about something for a minute where

1580
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:50,879
it's like the real

1581
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,159
so for let's say from like 85 to 2005

1582
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,640
okay um

1583
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,159
it was it was all

1584
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,239
traditional breeding as the lord

1585
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:59,679
intended it was all males and females

1586
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,439
yeah you know

1587
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,118
you just you let a few males go in a

1588
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,599
room full of ladies

1589
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,680
um and all the traditional types of

1590
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,359
breeding were applied for the most part

1591
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,399
because that's all anybody knew

1592
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,759
yeah

1593
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,760
and then uh around um

1594
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,359
you know uh

1595
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,119
i don't know matt knows better than me

1596
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:22,078
but probably somewhere around

1597
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,880
say oh six to 2010

1598
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,760
yeah

1599
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,318
uh

1600
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,480
a revolution happened

1601
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,558
in that um and i'll shut up here in a

1602
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,599
minute and let matt talk but certain

1603
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,599
people started on the forums

1604
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,680
uh and doing research and stuff like

1605
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,318
that figuring out that you could you

1606
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,279
could induce a female plant to produce

1607
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,400
pollen

1608
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,640
yeah and you could make feminized seed

1609
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,200
yeah and that information was rare and

1610
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,879
tightly held and how to do it was

1611
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,078
basically unknown

1612
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,280
and

1613
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,039
at first

1614
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,800
matt knows better than i do

1615
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,400
but it was kind of like who was it it

1616
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,839
was you and

1617
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,358
well i mean if you if you start back

1618
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,400
with the feminized stuff you had dutch

1619
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,558
passion really starting it um hai

1620
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,559
was doing some work on it sam the skunk

1621
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,960
man had covered a little bit of it

1622
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,480
fett from spice brothers had talked

1623
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,000
about it a bit and he was over in i

1624
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,760
think new zealand

1625
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,519
but as far as the american stuff it

1626
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,760
really didn't kick on into the american

1627
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,559
stuff till like og rascal

1628
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,440
hybe me csi

1629
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,359
and there are a few others but um soma

1630
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,480
yeah someone mentioned soma his

1631
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,279
his

1632
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,679
rotalization method was notorious which

1633
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,920
was basically the torture method the

1634
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,719
herm torture method

1635
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,480
right the small pop the extreme drought

1636
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,879
that gets the hell out of it they get it

1637
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,199
to think it's dying multiple times to

1638
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,358
the point where it freaks out and panics

1639
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,679
and throws some manners that you can use

1640
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,078
yeah and and

1641
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,598
during during that period probably i

1642
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,760
mean i want to say all the way up to

1643
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,480
like

1644
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:01,200
2013 2014 femme seeds were just looked

1645
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,318
down upon or at least the general

1646
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,798
consensus was all femmes herm often see

1647
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,358
term they all produce poor [ __ ]

1648
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:12,639
progeny it's all it's all riddled with

1649
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,400
[ __ ] mutants and you know and and even

1650
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,960
though that wasn't the case and people

1651
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:21,838
weren't finding that it didn't matter it

1652
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,838
was such a common a common theme

1653
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,880
that you were cheating

1654
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,279
cheating

1655
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,559
was a huge there was a huge issue with

1656
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,400
with feminized seed where most customers

1657
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,400
felt like you were cheating

1658
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,400
yeah

1659
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,559
you were [ __ ] up lines

1660
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,318
you were selling out for profit

1661
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,160
you were getting rid of males and

1662
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,199
getting rid of traditional breeding so

1663
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,798
you could

1664
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:51,118
um you could skip steps and profit

1665
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,358
yeah and people were looked down on

1666
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,519
yeah for feminized breeding and i should

1667
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:58,480
make the point the reason why i said it

1668
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:01,039
you know that era was because

1669
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,440
all the first people that matt mentioned

1670
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,199
they were not sharing

1671
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,920
how they did it

1672
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,000
no

1673
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,159
you couldn't find out from dutch passion

1674
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,920
how they were making feminize seed

1675
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,519
no no they didn't want that you couldn't

1676
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,480
find out from that you couldn't find out

1677
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:18,480
from any of these people yeah right so

1678
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,760
did it exist yes

1679
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,519
was it hidden knowledge 100

1680
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,079
one of the first people i did actually

1681
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,119
see say how to do it was phet

1682
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,599
um

1683
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,838
and he released someone else's info that

1684
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:35,119
was around but put it out there pretty

1685
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:39,039
wide and it was the first recipe um on

1686
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,880
how to make sts mixture that i saw but

1687
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,239
caleb remembers better than me on who

1688
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,318
was the original person that wrote it

1689
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,558
but my first introduction to it was when

1690
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,798
fett published it

1691
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,559
right and so you know

1692
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:51,679
yeah that stuff was

1693
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,519
um

1694
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:54,960
someone said collodial silver was hidden

1695
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,798
knowledge

1696
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,720
you know people want to say that like

1697
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:59,440
all the knowledge that people have right

1698
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,558
now

1699
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,679
um

1700
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:06,079
even with breeders like matt or like csi

1701
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:10,639
or people that have been doing feminized

1702
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:13,119
seeds for the last 10 to 12 14 years

1703
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,719
yeah it's still an art form with a lot

1704
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,480
of failure

1705
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,318
yes and there was a lot of failure in

1706
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,920
the beginning it wasn't just like oh i'm

1707
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,000
going to spray collodial silver or i'm

1708
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,599
going to spray some sts

1709
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,280
and now i'm done

1710
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,480
yeah you know when i was doing a bunch

1711
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,720
of breeding

1712
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,639
you don't really fail with males

1713
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,318
no no yeah i've never had a male tail

1714
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,000
you know like you don't i never had i

1715
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:35,679
never like was like oh i failed that

1716
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,838
whole seed run and now i'm growing like

1717
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:41,919
18 different strains

1718
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:44,000
one or two of each right yeah yeah you'd

1719
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,599
have one or two or three males and they

1720
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,519
would produce an enormous amount of

1721
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,318
pollen for your whole room

1722
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,318
yeah

1723
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,759
um when people first started

1724
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:53,039
experimenting and

1725
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,359
let's be clear

1726
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,798
we're not done experimenting

1727
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,679
no matt

1728
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:02,400
and csi and i and matt and csi and other

1729
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:05,358
various friends we talk all the time

1730
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,960
about improving methods

1731
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,400
limiting failure

1732
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,480
everyone fails

1733
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,960
yeah trying to trying to find the

1734
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,960
consist what what brings consistency in

1735
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,119
reversals is

1736
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,039
it's very hard i mean me

1737
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,559
i talked about this with csi three or

1738
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,440
four times a week just our different

1739
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:26,000
findings and and comparing our notes and

1740
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,400
all that [ __ ] and it's just we no one's

1741
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,440
found a consistent way to

1742
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,440
guarantee that every plant every

1743
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,358
expression of every plant meaning not

1744
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,960
just pheno but it's

1745
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,759
like expressions and

1746
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,440
of the same clone two feet apart why one

1747
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,760
reverses and drops pollen and the other

1748
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,000
reverses and doesn't there we have no

1749
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,079
answers to this yet i mean and it's

1750
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,480
always experimenting they've done you

1751
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,039
know they've done things where it's like

1752
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,639
matt or him have have reversed something

1753
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:56,239
and it's worked like a charm and they've

1754
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,798
gotten unbelievable results and it's

1755
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:00,399
dumped pollen yeah and then they go back

1756
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:01,838
and they use those same plants to

1757
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,760
reverse them again and they do the same

1758
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,880
thing to the plant and it fails

1759
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,680
yeah

1760
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,000
or

1761
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,798
or drops 10 of the amount of pollen it

1762
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,079
should

1763
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,239
yeah

1764
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,480
um and so

1765
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,719
you know i see i see our buddy pip yeah

1766
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,400
he failed i mean and failure is really

1767
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,639
frustrating for a breeder

1768
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,798
yeah you know you might only get

1769
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,318
if if you're non-stop breeding you might

1770
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:25,759
only get three or four cracks at

1771
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:27,358
breeding a year

1772
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,240
and if you want to buy the sds spray

1773
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,440
it's on riot seat code.com we got our

1774
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:32,639
reversal sprint someone asked about it

1775
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,720
so i'm gonna say

1776
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,118
reversal spray up at right seatco.com or

1777
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,558
you can buy it but just just read the

1778
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,400
read the directions because i'm very

1779
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,040
very transparent sometimes you're gonna

1780
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,798
have to try three or four times not to

1781
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,719
get it to reverse but to drop pollen

1782
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,400
there's a big difference reversing

1783
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,879
doesn't mean success

1784
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,440
showing balls doesn't mean success you

1785
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,640
only have success when it drops pollen

1786
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,480
and makes seeds and makes seeds and

1787
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:01,039
and you know even just on the forums and

1788
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,199
all the learning of like how much of

1789
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,960
what of each to use

1790
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,598
should i use collodial silver should i

1791
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,159
use sts should i use this other thing

1792
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,318
should i use that have i tried this

1793
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,239
yeah do i need less concentration do i

1794
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:17,119
need more concentration when do i

1795
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:19,759
combine them do i apply it once strong

1796
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,920
do i apply it 15 times a week

1797
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,599
and if you do all that and get success

1798
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,760
and try to repeat it the next time the

1799
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,760
exact same way with all the same inputs

1800
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,440
it may not perform the same way it's

1801
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,559
it's so uh

1802
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,760
it's frustrating it is so in a way

1803
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,079
um

1804
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,640
you know uh

1805
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,480
the the forum's slowly

1806
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:43,598
slowly pushing

1807
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,440
feminized seed was like a sea change in

1808
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,760
how people bred

1809
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,720
yeah because before everyone had to have

1810
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,640
males

1811
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,639
and everyone had to keep those males and

1812
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:55,199
everybody traded seed

1813
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:57,199
and then and then people were like oh i

1814
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,199
can take this elite

1815
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,798
and i can reverse it and cross it to

1816
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,118
these other elites

1817
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:05,679
yeah and so now most breeders honestly

1818
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,559
don't even have males

1819
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:11,519
a lot don't no yeah most most it's

1820
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,920
completely shifted in the last 10 to 14

1821
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:17,280
years from like a few people getting

1822
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,358
[ __ ] on for daring to reverse plants and

1823
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,359
cheating to being

1824
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,318
the way everyone does it

1825
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:24,639
yep

1826
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,798
and i made i made a backwards switch

1827
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,440
where i did almost all exclusively

1828
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:30,400
feminized breeding for a long time

1829
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,480
and

1830
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,039
went back to doing mostly male breeding

1831
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,079
despite selling the spray just because

1832
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,639
uh

1833
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,798
it is costly it is super costly to make

1834
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,798
femme seeds because of uh the failure

1835
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,960
i mean we've talked about it we've

1836
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:49,838
talked about it before and our like

1837
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,679
uh our buddy pip commented but

1838
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:52,880
um we've had a bunch of really good

1839
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,038
friends

1840
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,079
that have tried to reverse sour

1841
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,680
and uh um and failed

1842
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,119
yeah

1843
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,199
you know or

1844
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,280
you know i remember you know you know

1845
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,439
pip reversed it once and got like 30

1846
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,880
seeds yeah

1847
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,920
so you do this you do this whole thing

1848
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,318
and all of a sudden you're like oh i

1849
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,760
have a little handful for myself

1850
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,599
but i can't actually sell them to the

1851
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,880
public

1852
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,680
i don't even have enough to give to my

1853
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,880
friends

1854
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:23,919
yeah i think csi the first two or three

1855
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,760
times he tried to reverse tk failed yeah

1856
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,680
it was real bad and he kept trying

1857
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,039
different methods to even get the thing

1858
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,199
to reverse

1859
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,520
yeah and he finally got it to reverse

1860
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,038
and it gave him about 10 or 15 of the

1861
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:37,679
seeds he would normally get from

1862
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:41,280
something that reversed well yeah

1863
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:43,440
um so you know it it's completely

1864
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,440
shifted how people breed

1865
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,440
it's completely shifted what they're

1866
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,400
after it's completely shifted like what

1867
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,159
um

1868
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,200
you know what uh

1869
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:54,000
uh

1870
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,838
what customers expect

1871
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,679
because when i was talking about in the

1872
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,838
beginning a lot of these seed lines they

1873
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:00,719
would be available for like five or ten

1874
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:01,519
years

1875
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,199
yeah

1876
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,079
most seeds today are one-offs

1877
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,480
right

1878
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:11,119
and maybe that same breeder will go back

1879
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,039
and redo the line again

1880
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,039
but most seeds exist

1881
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,640
from however many seeds that dude got or

1882
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,039
that lady got

1883
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,279
until they're gone yeah and someone's

1884
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,680
asking about red pollen on femme plants

1885
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,000
it's totally fine it's totally fine a

1886
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:28,558
lot of a lot of today's clone on the

1887
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,199
lines that are being hit are

1888
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,960
femmes they're just made with bad seed

1889
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:36,719
herns so i mean it's it's so common that

1890
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,400
it's in moot point

1891
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:41,118
yes and yeah you could have things that

1892
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,160
you don't realize are a femme plant

1893
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,160
but yeah

1894
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,719
you know and

1895
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,639
you know um there i we i do have some

1896
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,239
thoughts on why things don't reverse

1897
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:52,239
well

1898
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,798
that could be a show in itself

1899
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:55,759
yeah um but people people should think

1900
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:57,519
about

1901
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,920
um you know because one of the things

1902
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,000
that breeders get hated on the most

1903
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,039
which i'm actually supportive of is

1904
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,079
herms

1905
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,400
yeah

1906
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:10,960
um because you got to think about for

1907
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,039
for forever of cannabis history

1908
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,599
perms were a survival tool

1909
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,280
yeah that allowed female plants to

1910
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,440
pollinate themselves and continue the

1911
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,960
species if for some reason the males got

1912
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,280
killed or the pollen failed or they

1913
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,119
weren't around yeah and so lots of

1914
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,798
strains hurt

1915
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:31,200
yeah and then in the beginning all the

1916
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,280
weed was seeded

1917
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,960
so why would you care if it hurt

1918
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,400
yeah it was relevant you're selling

1919
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,559
seeded weed all the thai all the

1920
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,240
colombian all the mexican all this that

1921
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,798
it was all it was all seat it was all

1922
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:45,279
seated yeah so it's only really herm

1923
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:46,480
started only really becoming an issue

1924
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,798
for people

1925
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,480
in probably the 90s

1926
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,880
late 80s early 90s when people were

1927
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,240
growing indoor and they had a very small

1928
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,240
amount of weed they were trying to grow

1929
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:57,519
for them or their friends or whatever

1930
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,358
and they didn't want to get a seated

1931
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,318
room

1932
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,000
right

1933
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:02,960
yep um

1934
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,440
but

1935
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,400
those herms had been bred in as a

1936
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,200
survival mechanism for cannabis for

1937
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,039
millennia probably

1938
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,199
and we've and there's only been about 30

1939
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,240
years of pressure to get rid of them

1940
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:17,118
yeah

1941
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:19,279
right

1942
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,640
and then now the cookies is the

1943
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,440
abundance

1944
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,000
it's back in full form well what happens

1945
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,798
to is somebody mentioned s-ones you know

1946
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,798
and stuff and and you know s-ones

1947
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:32,960
i'll be the maybe i'm not the first to

1948
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:35,440
tell you but s-ones kind of suck

1949
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,199
right yeah um you know i mean obviously

1950
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,519
i have friends that sell s1 so i'm not

1951
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,639
dissing it but even they will tell you

1952
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:44,000
that like

1953
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:46,078
the primary goal of an s1 is to find to

1954
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,199
look in that exact strain without an

1955
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,680
outcross

1956
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:51,919
and see what's in its genetics

1957
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,078
or for preservation period yeah or for

1958
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,318
preservation you know and and you're

1959
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:59,119
more likely to try to find an

1960
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,880
elite or two or something you like

1961
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:04,240
um than you are to get any kind of

1962
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,318
consistency yes you know um if you want

1963
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:08,798
consistency and you want phenols to pop

1964
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,960
at some rate and outcross is better

1965
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,639
yeah all right

1966
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,720
but in a lot of cases

1967
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:17,440
there might only be one cutting left of

1968
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:20,318
an entire line for you to work through

1969
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,039
yeah there might not be a male you know

1970
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:25,920
there people don't keep males either

1971
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,520
so how do you get a male a trinity

1972
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,200
yeah how do you how do you get a male of

1973
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,119
dog [ __ ] how do you get a male a corn

1974
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:34,318
how do you get a male of

1975
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:36,720
of you know you name it yeah

1976
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,159
you know i know in a lot of cases you

1977
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:39,759
can't

1978
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:41,358
you used to be able to get males by

1979
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,520
you'd buy the seed line and it was a

1980
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,598
regular seed line yeah

1981
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:47,920
now that it's almost all femme you can't

1982
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,400
even get a male if you wanted to

1983
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,639
yeah it would take some uh a lot of work

1984
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,838
people say why are some s1s uniform and

1985
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,279
some aren't

1986
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:57,519
because

1987
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,760
if you have a bunch of uniform

1988
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,679
s1s it means that there's not very much

1989
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:06,160
genetic variation in that cut whatsoever

1990
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,759
if you get a bunch of crazy stuff all

1991
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,318
over the place it means that you have a

1992
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,839
pretty wide genetic lineage in there and

1993
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,880
it's going to express in all kinds of

1994
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,719
different ways so to dumb it down it

1995
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,240
just means

1996
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,159
if you have a bunch of variation you

1997
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,399
have a line that probably wasn't worked

1998
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,159
if you have a a uniform line it was

1999
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,480
probably whatever that clone was came

2000
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:29,440
from a line that was either worked or

2001
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,318
already uniform to begin with by nature

2002
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,760
yeah

2003
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:32,880
you know so

2004
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,039
um

2005
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,318
you know and and so males have become

2006
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,520
super rare

2007
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,239
you know and

2008
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:41,838
and all that and everyone is and so

2009
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,479
breeding has gone from almost a

2010
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:47,679
guaranteed success

2011
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,960
to very dicey yeah

2012
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:53,279
i would say yeah and and in

2013
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,880
natural agriculture or like agriculture

2014
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,119
normal agriculture

2015
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,680
most most breeding work is done with

2016
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:02,400
selfing and feminizing it's it's not a

2017
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,239
lot of male work um cannabis is just

2018
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,280
catching up to that

2019
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:09,279
just catching up to it

2020
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,720
and you know it um

2021
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,720
and that's the other part of it is like

2022
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,919
real real i don't say real breeding

2023
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,439
because i don't want to insult anyone

2024
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,679
but

2025
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,480
agricultural breeding they are breeding

2026
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,838
with very specific goals in mind

2027
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,838
yeah

2028
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,039
you know

2029
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:26,559
um mostly bleeding is goals mostly

2030
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:27,920
that's what it is well i mean in

2031
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,560
cannabis breeding i don't know if it's

2032
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,158
goals no seed making seed making in

2033
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,759
cannabis is not goals but actual

2034
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:35,759
breeding

2035
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:37,119
so so for instance if you're breeding

2036
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,079
something like i'll just throw it out

2037
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:43,039
there like corn you might be going for

2038
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:45,039
ear size and disease resistance and pest

2039
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:47,119
resistance and when it finishes and you

2040
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,798
have certain traits you're looking for

2041
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:50,798
yeah and if you're gonna self or you're

2042
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:53,278
gonna like breed on that level you're

2043
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:54,719
finding plants that match all those

2044
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,080
characteristics and you're trying to

2045
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,119
lock them in

2046
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:58,880
yeah

2047
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,198
you know um

2048
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,039
for the way we breed now

2049
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:06,000
most people are just most people aren't

2050
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:09,198
growing rooms a seed anymore

2051
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,279
you're just pheno hunting

2052
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,559
for a lot of people yeah you know so

2053
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,319
there's not a lot of breeders that are

2054
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,960
like i need to be able to breed this

2055
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,560
super consistent urkel by snow

2056
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,480
because people are going to plant acres

2057
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,560
of it and these are the qualities

2058
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:24,000
they're looking for when they plant it

2059
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,839
yeah

2060
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,880
you're like crossing things and then

2061
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,439
hoping

2062
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,199
you know hoping something pops up and so

2063
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,879
you know our buddy bitter just said

2064
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,678
breeding should be goal-oriented it

2065
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,838
should

2066
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,920
yeah i mean

2067
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,000
and the more goals you add to what you

2068
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,399
want the harder you made your job

2069
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,158
yeah it's real hard the more you start

2070
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,479
adding to it

2071
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:48,079
finding what you want in one plant the

2072
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,678
more things you put on that plant that

2073
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,119
you have to have is tough

2074
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,560
yeah

2075
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,960
you know um

2076
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,400
and so a lot of times now

2077
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,079
maybe we should talk about this for a

2078
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:59,920
second because this is totally your era

2079
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,439
where it's like when breeding

2080
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,760
breeding became

2081
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,000
i'm going to reverse this plant

2082
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,800
that's an elite that most people can't

2083
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,640
get

2084
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,640
yeah and i'm going to cross it to these

2085
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,679
10 or 15 things that you also probably

2086
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,000
can't get

2087
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,600
yeah and i'm going to sell seeds and you

2088
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,039
probably can't get either parent but

2089
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,719
here's a hybrid

2090
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,640
yeah and you've already gotten excited

2091
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,560
about both parents

2092
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,039
so maybe there's something cool in the

2093
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,120
hybrid i haven't tested it

2094
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,000
but there's a lot of breeders out there

2095
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:29,840
now

2096
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,920
that don't test their own work

2097
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,520
yes correct they take this they're going

2098
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,279
to be like you know and i'm not calling

2099
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,800
anybody out specifically but it's like

2100
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,279
i'm going to take gelato this and i'm

2101
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,079
going to reverse it onto the

2102
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:44,399
12 most popular cuts i know of

2103
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:45,920
that are getting decent a decent ticket

2104
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:47,279
and then i'm going to add packaging and

2105
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,640
i'm going to make a special name for

2106
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:50,399
each one and i'm going to hope somebody

2107
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,360
finds something bomb and it helps my

2108
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:53,359
sales yeah

2109
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,679
you do you don't yeah you do lose you do

2110
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,120
you lose hybrid vigor with s1 there

2111
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,880
isn't a hybrid vigor there is no hybrid

2112
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:06,319
you're breathing with your

2113
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:10,079
you can lose vigor yes with s1's however

2114
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:11,439
depending on it it's it's

2115
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,679
it depends on how you compare it because

2116
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,238
there's lines that are old clones that

2117
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,920
are slow and if you if you make s ones

2118
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,759
of it it'll make it look like you've

2119
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,279
given the line new vigor but it's just

2120
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,800
because you were growing an old slow

2121
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:24,399
clone so

2122
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,119
it depends on how people look at it but

2123
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:30,079
hybrid vigor it it like like not so

2124
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:32,158
saying it it implies hybrid hybridizing

2125
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,079
and if it's an s1 it's selfie not

2126
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:36,479
hyperbolic the way i look at maybe this

2127
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:40,319
is a bad definition too because we could

2128
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:42,639
talk about how misused uh names are in

2129
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,399
in you know people get breeding terms

2130
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,800
from other areas and try to apply them

2131
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:48,559
to cannabis yeah and it doesn't it's not

2132
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,800
exactly a straight because we don't have

2133
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,080
the same kind of breeding techniques

2134
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,880
but generally speaking uh hybrid vigor

2135
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:59,439
is when you take two p1 parents and

2136
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,760
cross them and in the hybrid

2137
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:04,559
all of the dominant genes pop

2138
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,800
it's not just two p1 parents though it's

2139
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,600
two specifically

2140
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,119
different genotypes it has it's not they

2141
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,480
can't be similar in order to get it it

2142
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,880
has to be totally different to get the

2143
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:17,678
hybrid figure so you know a famous one

2144
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,119
would be you know i don't know nl5 haze

2145
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,520
or something yeah yeah

2146
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:22,960
would be one a very a very indica with a

2147
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,159
very sativa

2148
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,800
very different lineages pops right yes

2149
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:31,039
um and so and that's another thing too

2150
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,719
is people don't like this and this is

2151
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,880
this is what's like

2152
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:37,439
if you look on some of the lineage stuff

2153
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,760
of like i'm going to cross cushmints by

2154
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:41,599
apples and banana by this and that like

2155
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,520
there's so much incestuous stuff that's

2156
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,520
gone on because people have overused the

2157
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,520
same clones over and over and over and

2158
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,679
over again yeah

2159
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,080
most of the most successful crosses are

2160
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,239
by crossing vastly different things from

2161
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:57,039
one another

2162
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:59,439
reading today is a lot more of i wonder

2163
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,679
if i can find my own slight variation on

2164
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:02,960
this already popular theme

2165
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,960
yeah

2166
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,198
wouldn't you agree yeah i'm not saying

2167
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,679
everyone i'm not going to everyone

2168
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:12,960
there's no exceptions but the majority

2169
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:15,279
is looking for this is already popular

2170
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,960
maybe i can get maybe the name and maybe

2171
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:18,960
the look and maybe the pictures will

2172
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,840
catch on yeah

2173
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,840
and if i get one famous thing you know

2174
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,760
i'm not going to call them out but like

2175
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,600
um look at what

2176
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:31,600
finding mac one did for for cap yeah

2177
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,679
you know somebody finds a what they

2178
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,120
consider to be a killer pheno in your

2179
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,039
stuff

2180
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,800
and all of a sudden the next

2181
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,760
however many seed drops you have sell

2182
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,000
out

2183
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,880
yeah and there's hype around it

2184
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,800
yeah but most people don't find their

2185
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,840
own stuff because they're not

2186
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,760
um

2187
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,239
they're not growing their own stuff

2188
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,679
yeah honestly like our buddy caleb is

2189
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:55,359
one of the few people where you can just

2190
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,319
see years and years and years of him

2191
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:59,759
popping his own seeds that he made yeah

2192
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,479
i'm gonna answer this question real

2193
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,280
quick

2194
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:06,959
um because it's one i see a lot and and

2195
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:09,119
it's there's no steadfast answer to it

2196
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,960
um it was from nigel no friends how much

2197
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:12,960
phenotypic genotypic variation do you

2198
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,640
experience from s-ones i've read a lot

2199
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,119
of contradicting information and the

2200
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,079
answer is it really depends on how

2201
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,559
worked

2202
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:23,600
one parent was if it's if it's a self

2203
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,800
how how worked that clone was and how

2204
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:29,120
not worked

2205
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:30,880
the the pollen donor is um if if it's a

2206
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,840
worked line let's say it's a

2207
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,159
a

2208
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,840
a deep chunk let's go deep jump if it's

2209
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:36,799
a deep chunk and you s one deep chunk

2210
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,719
you're not going to have very much

2211
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,199
variation at all because it's a work

2212
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,719
line there's already very few phenotypes

2213
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:44,799
in the line that you selected the clone

2214
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,640
from let's say you choose like cushman's

2215
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,159
you you s1a phenotype of cushman's well

2216
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,560
there's all kinds of [ __ ] in that i

2217
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:53,198
mean it's going to be variant

2218
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:56,080
to any degree you know so that's that's

2219
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:58,079
why there's no specific answer to how

2220
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,519
much variation is in an s1 it just

2221
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,079
really depends on the parents and

2222
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,320
another way to put it and uh

2223
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,198
uh caleb talked about this before where

2224
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,679
it's like

2225
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:09,119
let's say you were to s1 deep chunk

2226
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,199
yeah and you were to give out a bunch of

2227
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,640
those seeds and let people make their

2228
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,238
own selections

2229
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,440
because there's not much variation in

2230
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:17,439
that line

2231
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:18,719
the people's own selections they're

2232
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,599
probably going to look a lot like deep

2233
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:24,399
chunk yeah but he's he's talked about

2234
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:27,840
like how the mendo p that i that i found

2235
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,920
has very very wide variation in in the

2236
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,400
s-ones which leads us to believe that it

2237
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,239
might be an actual land race right

2238
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:37,039
um so you could he's like you know you

2239
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:39,279
could give 50 or 100 seeds to 20 people

2240
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:40,800
and tell them pick what they want

2241
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,479
yeah and then if you had them two years

2242
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,079
later all gather and bring the weed that

2243
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,238
they had created

2244
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:48,800
it would look vastly different because

2245
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,238
people would be making their own choices

2246
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,960
and that's actually some of the stuff

2247
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:56,238
even early on like people like mel frank

2248
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,480
that sent durbin to holland

2249
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:00,879
or different things breeders will tell

2250
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:02,639
you well it was this way when i had it

2251
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,079
yeah but then i gave it to these guys

2252
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,480
and they made different choices than i

2253
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,719
would have yeah and now it's not even

2254
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,559
remotely like what i preferred

2255
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,760
yeah because they made different choices

2256
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,760
than i did

2257
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,600
sure i liked it anise and they made it

2258
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,840
all red hair and sweet

2259
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,800
yeah or bite or this or that or whatever

2260
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,760
so

2261
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,920
um

2262
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:25,760
you know it uh

2263
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,199
so s1 s s1 is just a tool

2264
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,840
like these are all just these are all

2265
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:32,319
just tools there's no there's no like

2266
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,400
better way than another necessarily

2267
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:36,559
um they're all just like based on what

2268
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:39,599
you're looking for

2269
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,960
you know um are you looking for

2270
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,880
you know it's never really happened

2271
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,800
before but like are you looking for like

2272
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,199
i want to plant 10 acres and i want it

2273
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,520
to be uniform

2274
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:51,279
something like as uniform as deep chunk

2275
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,000
would be very valuable for that

2276
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:55,759
yeah absolutely you know something like

2277
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,279
you know but there's other there's other

2278
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,960
lines that are all over the place that

2279
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,559
wouldn't be very good for that

2280
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,399
but that line that's all over the place

2281
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,679
it might be amazing to find

2282
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,399
a unique

2283
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,399
expression that you can then clone and

2284
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:09,439
name and all of a sudden it becomes an

2285
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,158
elite

2286
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:13,519
and and to add to that

2287
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,399
a lot of people don't understand that

2288
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,719
when you select a clone uh from a from a

2289
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,399
wide varied line let's say it's

2290
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,239
you pop a thousand seats and it's the

2291
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,839
only clone like it if you select that

2292
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:27,039
clone to breathe

2293
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:30,239
it may not be breeding true to the type

2294
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:32,960
that it is because it was an outlier it

2295
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:35,119
may only show up one in 500 times in the

2296
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,560
f2 round so it doesn't necessarily mean

2297
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,399
because you picked that clone it's

2298
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,800
always going to be like that clone if

2299
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,399
that clone is an outlier you are not

2300
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,760
going to run into that clone very often

2301
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:46,079
it'll be more often than you did in the

2302
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,159
f1 but however

2303
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,238
it'll still not be very often

2304
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:53,039
again it could be an odd combination of

2305
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,959
recessive traits yep and just because it

2306
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:57,439
popped in that particular female doesn't

2307
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,560
mean it'll pop in it's progeny

2308
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,879
yeah

2309
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,880
either

2310
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,479
with me sorry that's all right

2311
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,880
and you know people there was a guy up

2312
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,959
there saying get rid of all the anise

2313
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,800
you know um

2314
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,719
you know everybody has strong opinions

2315
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,640
about various flavors i don't think we

2316
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:18,480
should get rid of any flavor

2317
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,840
um because everyone has different

2318
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:20,718
preferences

2319
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,400
yeah

2320
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,239
yeah you know

2321
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:25,599
um there was yeah don't say that here

2322
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,599
because then gene's gonna think that i'm

2323
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,640
[ __ ] [ __ ] talking him and [ __ ] all

2324
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,199
that [ __ ] no there was a time

2325
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,119
there was a time when uh when

2326
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:37,678
um

2327
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,800
you know like terpenoline in uh

2328
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,719
in uh watching my [ __ ] uh

2329
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,199
you know and jack

2330
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,119
or train wreck

2331
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:49,039
was loved

2332
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:51,840
it was certainly loved yeah it was

2333
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:54,079
absolutely loved and then it bred so

2334
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,319
true for itself that people got burnt

2335
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:57,279
out on the true penalty yeah

2336
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,519
people

2337
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,759
[ __ ] a man people

2338
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,719
like calio and all this citrus stuff

2339
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,400
came out

2340
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,000
and it was hella popular for a minute

2341
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,839
and then it's like moderate potency and

2342
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,439
kind of one note and it sort of faded

2343
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,279
from

2344
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:12,319
it sort of faded from the world a little

2345
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,639
bit yeah

2346
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:16,719
and then you know the dab revolution

2347
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,920
happened well you know with and nails

2348
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,920
started coming out and all these

2349
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,399
accoutrements to be able to like smoke

2350
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,600
hash in a different way yeah and [ __ ]

2351
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:28,319
dna comes out with tangy yeah and the

2352
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,159
most blown out terp that nobody wanted

2353
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:32,319
was new again

2354
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,039
and people were like oh this citrus is

2355
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:37,198
just phenomenal oh my god

2356
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:39,600
stoked on this citrus where did this

2357
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:42,559
come from where 10 years before people

2358
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,719
would be like ooh citrus no no no

2359
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,719
yeah i don't want a [ __ ] citrus i

2360
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,520
call that [ __ ] headache weed man i

2361
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:51,279
always

2362
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,800
i was not a fan of uh calio or uh any

2363
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:54,158
kind of tangy or any of that [ __ ] but

2364
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,320
what's interesting about that kind of

2365
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:59,920
stuff is when tangy came out you know um

2366
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:01,840
because it came out in the first few

2367
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,560
years of sort of like the modern like

2368
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,239
hash dab revolution yeah

2369
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,639
it's not very potent

2370
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,559
no but it didn't matter as flower you'd

2371
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,719
get bored of it pretty quickly yeah but

2372
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,320
you turn it into bho or you turn it like

2373
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,560
there wasn't rosin really then you turn

2374
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:20,799
it into some kind of extract and now it

2375
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,760
goes from like 13 percent thc to 80.

2376
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,000
yeah

2377
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,520
and it gets everything at that point you

2378
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,359
know and there was an there was another

2379
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,360
aspect too where it's like a lot of

2380
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,198
times with extractions not all those

2381
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,759
terps come through strong

2382
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:35,198
yeah but those citrus terps popped

2383
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,039
strong

2384
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:39,198
so all of a sudden they had it's like

2385
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:41,439
bell bottoms coming back or something

2386
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:42,479
yeah like you know you you couldn't give

2387
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:43,599
them away

2388
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,279
and then all of a sudden the next

2389
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,960
generation is like this citrus is

2390
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:48,399
incredible can we get more lemon can we

2391
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,399
get more orange can we get more

2392
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:53,439
tangerine yeah

2393
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,439
and it's kind of faded

2394
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,239
right yeah

2395
01:20:55,279 --> 01:21:01,920
i mean we had a our our buddy uh

2396
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:04,000
our buddy pip rocked that lemon g cut

2397
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,840
yeah a lot

2398
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,760
you know and so people things go in and

2399
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,199
out of things go in and out of in and

2400
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,960
out of flavor you know

2401
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,638
i was talking about that with panda the

2402
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,960
other day i was smoking some georgia pie

2403
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:17,119
and i had no no [ __ ] clue what it was

2404
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,319
like what was in it but

2405
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,840
lemon g

2406
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:24,319
has this certain specific [ __ ] flavor

2407
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,319
that runs through all of its progeny and

2408
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,079
it's this thing get like for me i could

2409
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:30,639
not scrape that flavor off my tongue

2410
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,238
hard or fast enough but i smoked that

2411
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,600
georgia pie and you can immediately

2412
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:36,079
sense it in there but it's not listed in

2413
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,000
the genetics so i hope those people who

2414
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:39,359
have it out there give it give it a give

2415
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,679
it a little flavor puff and if you have

2416
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,679
some lemon g to compare it to uh uh tell

2417
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:45,279
me if i'm right

2418
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,279
so it you know and someone someone was

2419
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:49,198
talking about just just now like they

2420
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:50,238
were talking about how uh

2421
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:51,279
um

2422
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,198
you know

2423
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:55,119
uh train wreck train wreck was kind of

2424
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:57,919
unique because it was like it was one of

2425
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:00,000
the first named clones in humboldt

2426
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,158
yeah it yielded really big

2427
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,079
people was all of a sudden going indoors

2428
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,439
and stuff and getting big heels out of

2429
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,600
it

2430
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:08,879
and you know jack herrera becoming so

2431
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,800
popular

2432
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,239
burned people out on the terp for

2433
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,600
probably 10 years

2434
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,519
yeah

2435
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,840
and train wreck being just [ __ ]

2436
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,760
everywhere for a while

2437
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,880
yeah train wrecking they just it just

2438
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:25,840
gets burned out you know and so you know

2439
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,800
flavors and terp profiles come and go

2440
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,039
yeah you know uh i i don't really like

2441
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,639
like for me like like that kind of

2442
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:34,960
citrus isn't that popular because i

2443
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,840
think it's too one dimensional for me

2444
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,760
but i do like the sweet

2445
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,079
citrus there's some of it where it's it

2446
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,079
it it tastes like i opened my mouth and

2447
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:47,119
sprayed orange cleaner on directly on my

2448
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:49,119
tongue yeah yeah it's like astringent

2449
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:51,198
yeah that's how i feel about lemon g is

2450
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:52,800
it's just like having a lemon grow a

2451
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:54,879
dick and piss in your mouth

2452
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,039
yeah you know and so like if you like

2453
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,279
sushi or whatever like uh citrus could

2454
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,560
be like a really good like like pickled

2455
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,079
ginger

2456
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,880
it could be like a really good palate

2457
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:07,519
cleanser before you smoke something else

2458
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,560
but most people can't rock citrus all

2459
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,520
day long

2460
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,440
no

2461
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,120
no you know they got me anyways they get

2462
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:15,119
burned out on it but some people love it

2463
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,198
so it tends to like you know i mean

2464
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:19,198
that's that's kind of the thing where

2465
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:21,599
um i can't remember who commented on it

2466
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:23,678
but we were talking a bunch about skunk

2467
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,840
one in a previous episode

2468
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,600
and there was an era where like they

2469
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,800
gypsy nirvana and those different guys

2470
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,960
they all gave away skunk one as freebies

2471
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,639
yeah oh yeah because they had because

2472
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,679
they had a [ __ ] ton of it nobody wanted

2473
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,319
to buy it

2474
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,000
nobody wanted skunk one nobody nobody

2475

like god i got thousands of these things

2477
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,320

2498
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:24,000
uh

2499
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,920
the blue flavor

2500
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,760
does it taste like blueberries

2501
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,199
yes whoa

2502
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,119
i've never smoked weed that tasted like

2503
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,000
blueberries i want to get something

2504
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,479
yeah

2505
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
right a good blueberry should taste like

2506
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:38,000
blueberries yeah

2507
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,520
you know and and so

2508
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,158
you know um

2509
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,040
super skunk is not still around

2510
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:44,799
uh

2511
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:47,760
i mean from scentsy

2512
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,960
i just mean like like there aren't

2513
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,639
what we know of for sure as pure

2514
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,198
super skunk cuts

2515
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:57,920
we believe diesel is a is is there's a

2516
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,279
lot of stuff this derives from it yeah i

2517
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,279
think jesus is probably one of the

2518
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,599
closest but yeah we don't know if it's a

2519
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,359
hybrid of super skunk technically like

2520
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,280
we can't say

2521
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:09,599
we we can look at it and be like man it

2522
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:12,079
really has a lot of super skunk traits

2523
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,600
yeah extremely skunkoid in the way that

2524
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:15,439
it grows and the way that it is and the

2525
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,440
way that that but

2526
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,119
maybe that's maybe that's something that

2527
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:20,479
we should talk about because matt and i

2528
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:22,479
talked about it when we were kind of

2529
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:24,079
like mapping out what we wanted to chat

2530
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:26,559
is that

2531
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:28,880
every five or ten years

2532
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,800
uh what you can get from seed reinvents

2533
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,760
itself and so there's all these distinct

2534
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,639
arrows

2535
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,719
yeah

2536
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,480
and i i mentioned it before on on

2537
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,840
another thing but we were matt and i

2538
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,638
were looking through a friend's

2539
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,960
um freezer that he was getting rid of

2540
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,880
and it had an enormous amount of seeds

2541
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,719
from like 08 to

2542
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,359
2012.

2543
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,800
yeah and i would say 99 of them if you

2544
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:55,599
wanted to buy a pack of it today you

2545
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,320

2546
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,440
yeah

2547
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:59,279
there was tons of there you could never

2548
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:00,559
get there there was stuff from mr knight

2549
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,238
there was there was a few things here

2550
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,239
and there that you could get from the

2551
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,399
same company but for the most part it

2552
01:26:04,238 --> 01:26:10,158
was all like but that stuff at the time

2553
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:12,399
was hella popular yeah

2554
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:14,238
right yeah

2555
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:15,679
it was everywhere back then but it was

2556
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:17,439
everywhere it was everywhere it was

2557
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,679
hella popular and then you know he

2558
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:21,519
talked about og rascal og rascal for

2559
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,039
three or four years

2560
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,239
you know he had a bunch of good cuts and

2561
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:25,760
he was one of the first guys doing

2562
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:28,718
feminized seed and he made a bunch of

2563
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,719
fire yeah he even had a super skunk cut

2564
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,560
that was uh the 56 days super skunk i

2565
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:35,039
want to say something like that

2566
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,880
but you you you couldn't you can't find

2567
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,679
that [ __ ] now nope

2568
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:42,400
no it doesn't exist so so what happens

2569
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:43,440
is seeds people talk sensi scentsy still

2570
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:44,238
exists

2571
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,000
but

2572
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:48,638
you you can't get anything like you

2573
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,119
would get from 90 censi no nothing you

2574
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,079
can't get you can't get 90s serious

2575
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:53,198
seats

2576
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:54,800
yeah i mean some of these people might

2577
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:56,319
get mad at me for saying it but it's

2578
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,360
just like it's just not the way [ __ ]

2579
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:58,799
works

2580
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:00,639
it does it just doesn't work it's

2581
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,800
different the parents are different

2582
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:05,440
maybe they had to reconstitute the line

2583
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,960
from seed you know

2584
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:10,559
maybe they outsourced it to spain

2585
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,079
who knows yeah

2586
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,880
um

2587
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:16,319
for sure most most seeding most seeds

2588
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,039
are they're there until they're not

2589
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:20,719
there and then after

2590
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,158
you know 10 years or something like that

2591
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:25,359
the only thing that exists might be a

2592
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:25,359
cut or two yeah

2593
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,400
right well we're about

2594
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,079
almost at 100 minutes so we'll start

2595
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,238
turning this down yeah we're going in

2596
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:35,279
far

2597
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:36,479
so yeah is there anything else you

2598
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:38,479
wanted to get in

2599
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:40,399
you know i mean that this is a big topic

2600
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:41,759
you know i just lost a huge topic i just

2601
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:43,599
thought that it would be good for people

2602
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,600
to chat about there's a lot of

2603
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,400
misconceptions about what breeders are

2604
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,760
up to

2605
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:50,879
and what they're doing and what their

2606
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:53,039
methods are and and and you know

2607
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,719
um all that and like breeding has

2608
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:57,279
evolved a lot

2609
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,800
and yeah breeding also evolves based on

2610
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,198
competition and based on what the

2611
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,400
customers want yeah

2612
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:05,039
right

2613
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:05,839
it's the customers drive it fully now

2614
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:08,800
it's

2615
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:11,039
because because the prices are so low on

2616
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,719
wheat currently i don't think that there

2617
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,519
is a a

2618
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:17,679
an option for breeders to try to drive a

2619
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,719
market as much based on

2620
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,800
um

2621
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:23,359
their own hype their own you know like

2622
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,119
building a brand building the line it's

2623
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:27,119
not like it was

2624
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:28,960
no and i think there was a when i was

2625
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:30,800
doing most of my breeding

2626
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,198
there was there wasn't really american

2627
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,279
breeders there wasn't really an outlet

2628
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:37,359
yeah for those kind of seeds

2629
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:40,079
that i you know we were we we wanted to

2630
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:42,158
be but this was it was too early

2631
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:44,479
yeah and there was kind of i would say

2632
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,079
there's probably a 10-year explosion of

2633
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:48,000
american breeders and all kinds of

2634
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:50,960
people being able to jump in and be like

2635
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,479
i'm gonna make crosses with this yeah

2636
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,319
and that's kind of i think we're coming

2637
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:55,678
to the tail end of that now yeah we

2638
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:58,079
definitely are people are having to

2639
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:00,319
figure out whole different ways of

2640
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,079
reinventing their companies themselves

2641
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,319
how seeds are sold

2642
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:06,800
how they're marketed yeah

2643
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:08,399
yeah and and and just you know and on

2644
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,800
top of that it's like

2645
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:13,599
it was profitable for a while

2646
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,560
yeah and and the profit is is you know

2647
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,719
uh

2648
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,719
profit is defined you know most of these

2649
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,719
seed companies were all supported by a

2650
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:23,359
bunch of small and medium-sized growers

2651
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:25,359
with extra money in their pocket yeah

2652
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,439
so as it becomes more centralized and it

2653
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:29,198
becomes more legalized

2654
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:31,519
then there's less money going around

2655
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:33,599
there's less desire to hunt through

2656
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:36,080
things yeah

2657
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,600
less ability yeah yeah and even and even

2658
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,719
then too it's like

2659
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,880
people today if you want to start

2660
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,679
breeding today you're going to get a

2661
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,039
hodgepodge of plants that are a mix of

2662
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,920
everything that's been popular in the

2663
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,279
last 15 years

2664
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,039
big worm

2665
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,198
was the high water mark was we're

2666
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:54,399
holding his dick picture got weak that

2667
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:55,919
was the highest that was the highest

2668
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:58,000
point we ever got

2669
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,480
that's for damn sure

2670
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,719
i i mean you know a lot of these a lot

2671
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,359
of these people got famous for a minute

2672
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,399
yeah in certain circles you know

2673
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:09,439
um

2674
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:12,158
yeah you know lucky dog lucky dog is our

2675
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:14,238
is our buddy uh you know he

2676
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,079
he uses a lot of real cuts

2677
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,319
yeah and one of the best ways to be a

2678
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:21,279
good breeder as neville would say is to

2679
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:22,079
have good good plants to work with

2680
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:24,000
yeah

2681
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:26,319
you can be he knows good weed he's been

2682
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,520
around good weed forever that's a major

2683
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:30,000
advantage

2684
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,719
yeah knowing good weed knowing good weed

2685
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,279
and

2686
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,600
and honestly um

2687
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,119
maybe uh i always i always get weirded

2688
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,560
out when i talk about this but maybe we

2689
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,439
could finish a little bit on this is

2690
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,679
that

2691
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:43,279
what's happened a lot with ig

2692
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,239
as we're on ig

2693
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:47,359
is uh

2694
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:51,359
yeah um it's it's become very visual

2695
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:53,359
yeah uh breeding and people's desire for

2696
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:55,920
stuff has become extremely visual and

2697
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,359
extremely testing based and extremely

2698
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,760
named based

2699
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:01,599
where 20 years ago 15 years ago it was

2700
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,920
mostly effect based

2701
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,719
yeah right things became popular because

2702
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,480
they had a great flavor a great effect

2703
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,359
right uh because most people couldn't

2704
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:10,158
see it

2705
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:13,039
right

2706
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:15,198
and so people bred for effect

2707
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:17,760
and there's a there's a corollary here

2708
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:19,039
where in uh i don't know most people i

2709
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,760
don't know if people know this or not

2710
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:21,198
but

2711
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,079
pit bulls and like staffordshire

2712
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:26,238
terriers are basically the same breed

2713
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:28,079
right yes staffordshire terriers are

2714
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,799
bred for looks

2715
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,719
and back in the day when when actual dog

2716
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,960
fighting was still allowed pit bulls

2717
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,079
were bred for what was called game

2718
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,760
yeah right and game was basically a

2719
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,760
uh i don't approve of dog reading by the

2720
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,800
way but it's a good example game was

2721
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,639
basically

2722
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:48,000
um

2723
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:49,920
a complete disregard for its own health

2724
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,840
and a willingness to just get crazy and

2725
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,000
fight to the death yeah

2726
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,639
but you couldn't like but much like with

2727
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,679
cannabis and smoking it you can't see

2728
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,239
gain

2729
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:02,560
yeah game isn't shoulder structure and

2730
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,158
chin and jaw and color

2731
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,760
none of that you have to find it in

2732
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:07,439
there so

2733
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,600
you can't tell if weed's going to knock

2734
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:12,399
your head off by looking at it no you

2735
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,280
sure can you know there's a lot of ugly

2736
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:16,000
weed

2737
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:18,000
that hits me way way harder than some of

2738
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,079
the prettiest weed i've ever seen

2739
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,679
that tests it like eight percent and it

2740
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:23,359
will knock your head off harder than the

2741
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,440
pretty no it's like a lot of good sours

2742
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,519
or whatever they test in the low 20s

2743
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,839
yeah exactly you get some purple punch

2744
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,480
that tested 30 and i can't even tell i'm

2745
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:35,360
smoking weed yeah and so there's a lot

2746
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,879
of uh as people have bred for looks and

2747
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:40,319
bed for testing

2748
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,600
yeah they've lost that invisible effect

2749
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:43,439
yeah

2750
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,679
people call it the entourage effect they

2751
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:48,719
think oh it's some combination of thc

2752
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:51,039
and terps and this and that and theolos

2753
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,800
or whatever we don't really know

2754
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:56,000
what it's all there yet

2755
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:58,719
yeah you know and but we know that

2756
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,399
but people used to breed for effect

2757
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,480
and people used to hold on to things

2758
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:04,719
that had unique effects

2759
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:07,119
and cookies and these and these type of

2760
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:09,198
things started ushering in a wave and ig

2761
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:09,920
is super to blame

2762
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:12,158
for

2763
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:14,079

01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:53,439
there's a lot of very attractive very

2785
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,679
bland weed

2786
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:57,279
yeah a lot of blackberry kush out there

2787
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,639
a lot of bland weed

2788
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:00,479
yeah and so

2789
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:02,560
you know uh

2790
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,559
you know smoking for effect effect is

2791
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,920
invisible you can't you don't know it

2792
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,400
till you try it

2793
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,079
there's nothing there's no testing you

2794
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:11,439
know maybe we could get chimera on here

2795
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:13,760
and he totally disagree with me and make

2796
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,319
me look foolish but i still think that

2797
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,719
the best test is the smoke test

2798
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:20,559
yeah robots can't smoke weed and i'll go

2799
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,119
to i'll go to bat for that i don't care

2800
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:26,080
yeah because because of the end result

2801
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,760
what matters is how it affects me

2802
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:30,639
yeah or you

2803
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,639
yeah but one of us and you know yeah

2804
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:35,199
it's like it's it's whole it's our whole

2805
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:37,600
desire for it is for it to i want it to

2806
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:41,519
work good and taste good

2807
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:43,199
yeah those are the top two things for me

2808
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,880
effect and flavor now if i can get great

2809
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:46,479
yield and i can get great looks i can

2810
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,279
get all this other stuff great

2811
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:50,079
yeah

2812
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:52,639
you know but it's not i'd rather have it

2813
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:56,079
taste taste and work phenomenal

2814
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:57,600
yeah because in a joint you know

2815
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:00,000
it looks like a white pee a white or a

2816
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,159
tan piece of paper right yeah exactly

2817
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,679
exactly in a bong rip and a you know i

2818
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,599
mean what is it you know

2819
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,319
you extract it you don't even know what

2820
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,400
it looks like yeah now it's goo

2821
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,158
yeah all all extractions look the same

2822
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:13,920
to me i've never understood i mean

2823
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:15,599
there's different types or whatever yeah

2824
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,359
i mean in general it's all a [ __ ]

2825
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,719
extract you're looking at goo or you're

2826
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:20,559
looking for it's all different types of

2827
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,560
goo so it's like you know at that at

2828
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,639
that point uh what did what did chimera

2829
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,280
call it uh you're a resin farmer

2830
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,359
yeah that's right you're farming resin

2831
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:30,319
yeah the flower content and stuff like

2832
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:31,198
that

2833
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:32,319
um

2834
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:34,879
you know

2835
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:36,158
it doesn't really matter so i'm big on

2836
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,000
effect

2837
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:39,118
yeah uh but effect doesn't come through

2838
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,520
ig

2839
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:43,599
until no it doesn't it's not yet

2840
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,119
it's a lot harder to build rep off

2841
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,159
effect because you actually have to

2842
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:48,479
smoke it

2843
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,079
yeah well it's not something test

2844
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,638
results can tell you by looking at the

2845
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:55,198
test results unfortunately no not yet at

2846
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,600
least we can't you know but tomorrow

2847
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:59,118
burner and and chris compound could come

2848
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,880
out with the new new

2849
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:03,198
yeah and it could be all glistening and

2850
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,359
perfect lighting and professional camera

2851
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:07,039
work and all that [ __ ] and everyone

2852
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:08,839
would ooh and ah and this and that

2853
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:11,920
nobody even knows if it's any good

2854
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:14,480
yeah maybe its effect is boring

2855
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:17,679
yeah yeah i remember a specific example

2856
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:18,638
that i won't say but yeah yeah you know

2857
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,158
so

2858
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,920
i just wanted to throw that out there at

2859
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:24,000
the end if we're going to talk about all

2860
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,520
that is that you know breed for what's

2861
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,800
important

2862
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,800
yeah the most important thing is effect

2863
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,279
right yeah because that's what you're

2864
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,039
that's how it affects you yeah

2865
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:35,920
and it doesn't affect everyone the same

2866
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,600
so

2867
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,039
you know try to smoke it with a decent

2868
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,560
variety of friends

2869
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:43,679
yeah

2870
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,679
and see what they think too

2871
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,880
that's how you find winners that's how

2872
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:51,039
you find real keepers in my opinion

2873
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:53,118
and that's and and to be honest

2874
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:55,039
that's the reason why

2875
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:56,559
you know stop some like a lot of these

2876
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,960
things from 20 years ago are going to

2877
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,320
have their day in the sun again

2878
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,399
i hope so

2879
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:03,759
because because look at all the people

2880
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:04,799
right now coming out with i have real

2881
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,560
sour

2882
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,239
yeah that's true that's a good point

2883
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,159
good point you know look at how many

2884
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:12,158
people still breed with kush

2885
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,679
yeah look at how many you know it's like

2886
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:15,359
look at how many people on these go like

2887
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,920
some friend you know are breeding with

2888

2889
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,480
lasting power

2890
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:21,439

2891
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:24,238
