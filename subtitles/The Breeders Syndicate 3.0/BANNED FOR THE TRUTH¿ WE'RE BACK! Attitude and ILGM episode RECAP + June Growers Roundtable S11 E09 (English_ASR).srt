Syndicate welcome to breeder Syndicate

20
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,038
I'm Matthew here with thousandfold and

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,039
we have a few friends with us that are

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,399
also Growers and uh we've been gone for

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,800
I guess what will now be a few weeks so

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,558
uh we will probably recap on that as

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,518
well at the beginning um real quick I

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,558
guess I'm just going to jump into that

27
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,679
and uh yeah

28
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,560
this so tell us what's happened in the

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,960
last couple of weeks yeah so for those

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,280
who don't know we did a few shows that

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,478
um we felt were really important uh for

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,799
a lot of the newer Growers or newer seed

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:22,039
buyers to understand what they were

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,840
going to be looking at when they first

35
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,960
came online to buy seeds um Based on

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,400
data and statistics and just what we see

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,399
around like we chose two different sites

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,600
that

39
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,040
being I I could say it because I can't

40
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,919
do anything the attitude and I love

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,920
growing MJ I don't want to say that now

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,640
um and uh yeah so we went through and we

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,640
showed like basically what red flags are

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,879
you know we didn't really go after with

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,118
the attitude we didn't go after the

46
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,000
attitude we went after not even specific

47
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,640
breeders just the biggest red flags we

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,640
saw of some of the more popular breeders

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,879
for new seed growers and um yeah they

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:11,479
just got flaged taken down um reported

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:16,120
for drug dealing which was just you know

52
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:19,919
I mean we're a a history and info show

53
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,480
that happens to be about cannabis so um

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:27,639
we ended up uploading those on Vimeo but

55
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:29,919
we did get strikes so that's uh

56
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,839
something so that's why we have been

57
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,878
down for a few weeks and uh yeah you

58
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,319
know I wanted to do a quick recap on it

59
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,560
as far as like letting you guys know

60
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,158
they're out there and we'll include the

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,360
links below um but they're important

62
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,519
episodes like just think about all the

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,959
money that we all spent as we got into

64
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,640
this and how much of like after having

65
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,000
some knowledge and learning how much

66
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,399
money was [ __ ] wasted with this

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,400
[ __ ] that that's meant to just

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,200
completely screw you um so yeah it's

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,480
important as it is and as as many

70
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:08,639
requests as we've got to do that we

71
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:10,598
tried and uh just didn't quite work so

72
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,079
maybe in the future we'll try again but

73
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:17,119
it's it's the whole idea was to show the

74
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,560
site and show proof of it evidence of it

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,280
as we're going through but that's really

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,439
where they got us is uh by showing their

77
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,400
websites so that's it thousand let's

78
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,280
talk about what we're going to talk

79
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,519
about

80
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,360
today yes so today we have kind of

81
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,080
similar to last season where we invited

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,360
on uh who was it spindle Big Ear local

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,519

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,120
what they're looking for what they found

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,640
we have sha do I call you sha O2 Sean or

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,039

90
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,158

91
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,319

92
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,519

93
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,199
Growing Experience has been like and

94
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,280
maybe to tie it back a little bit to

95
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:14,119
what Matt was saying maybe just as a

96
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,358
bonus add in any anecdote about I don't

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,160
know early Seedbank experiences that you

98
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,839
may have had okay how about we start

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,080
with uh let's go with Sean since we just

100
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,679
talked to

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:32,319
Sean all right so my first experience um

102
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,680
growing was back I think in like 2008

103
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,159
2009 when I was just getting out of high

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:42,079
school um prices of everything were just

105
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,720
like we so [ __ ] good so um my

106
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,198
friend's dad he used to grow back in the

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,360
90s so he was like oh let's get in on

108
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,919
this and everything and and put kind of

109
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,720
me and and his son in charge of looking

110
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:57,240
up and finding seeds um we first started

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,400
with bag seeds that were coming from

112
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,560
some friends that were getting stuff

113
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:06,560
from either where they said Michigan or

114
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,240
C and so we kind of did that and then

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,319
when that was kind of going all right

116
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,560
and producing decent plants um he kind

117
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,680
of want us to look at seeds and I

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,038
remember first looking and I was on

119
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,519
attitude I think it was like looking at

120
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,199
Nirvana stuff and I remember looking

121
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,879
through the stuff that was kind of the

122
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,960
Cannabis Cup winning and I think there

123
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,159
was like cryistal

124
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,198
um there was like Snow White

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,199
blue mystic um

126
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:41,879
Blackjack what else um like a couple

127
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:45,080
others Northern bright Northern bright

128
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,000
um and a few others that we're like

129
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:51,560
looking at and then we ended up choosing

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Northern bright um snow white blue

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,439
mystic Crystal

132
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,959
and couple others and we're they're

133
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,160
going good but he would always want to

134
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,359
cut him at like five weeks and then not

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,120
go through the actual like and then not

136
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,598
even try and let things dry and see

137
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,000
because he was like I gotta get

138
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,159
everything sold in six weeks and

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,639
everything like done five weeks sold in

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
six and then just like and I I didn't

141
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,280
know why but I mean he had a drug

142
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,719
addiction so he was trying to there you

143
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,000
go do that and he was yeah I mean he

144
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,039
ended up having us uh sell a bunch of

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,959
drugs for him after his son kind of like

146
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,360
blew up the spot because we ended up

147
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,799
renting this

148
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,479
big place this big nice house and we had

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,360
the whole basement that we were starting

150
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,879
up and his son of course like brought

151
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,560
people that weren't supposed to be over

152
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,240
and his dad was like [ __ ] this tore

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,720
everything down and then like then he

154
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,038
was just like oh here you want to have a

155
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,280
sell like uh you know roxies or whatever

156
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:56,000
that he's getting prescribed that turned

157
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,719
in just bad to just horrible decision

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,279
after decision and then I finally got

159
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,560
back into growing and 20 17 and was

160
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,839
looking around and I started um doing

161
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,000
some more research um I'd always kind of

162
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,198
pop in every here and there just kind of

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,839
reading things because I mean I always

164
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,598
wanted to really get into growing and

165
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,239
and that's just what I kind of just want

166

to do just have like you know whatever

167
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720

170
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,120
whatever but um yeah so I got back into

171
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,519
in like 201 2017 started growing some of

172
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,918
bie stuff I grew strawberry milk and

173
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,878
then Stevie

174
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,680
Wonder um which was that was a good one

175
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,680
both yeah both were good that's where I

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,280
first had my first introduction with

177
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,639
Appalachia with the strawberry milk um I

178
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,079
enoy wonder one of his first strains

179
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,598
ever is one of the F the earliest ones

180
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:58,240
too yeah I think Williams Wonder

181
00:07:53,598 --> 00:08:00,839
something um yeah I can't can't remember

182
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,519
exactly uh what it was I know it was a

183
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,598
appal I know it's the Appalachian the

184
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:09,198
father and then um Stevie Wonder it was

185
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:12,478
like train wreck

186
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,120
blueberry um something else uh to the

187
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,439
snow Lotus

188
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,519
father um and all those were you know

189
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,560
really great um and then from there I

190
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,758
started getting some seeds from my

191
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,680
friend who you know I would help out a

192
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,158
little bit here and there and he would

193
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,440
show me a few different things and and

194
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:34,519
helped me learn about like a little bit

195
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,120
of soil building and and just different

196
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,000
things like that or tricks I just didn't

197
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,200
really think of and then I finally got

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
into um [ __ ] I guess when the blue

199
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,720
bonnet lines came out that's really when

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,919
I started getting some uh matte seeds

201
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,959
and grew I guess yeah when the first

202
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:56,639
drop of the the like pre-release of the

203
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,719
blistering came out I popped those yeah

204
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,399
those were those were phenomenal I had

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,120
like one that turned turned like blue um

206
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,879
but had like GMO structure and smell it

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,240
was it was like a perfect mixture of the

208
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,759
Bonnet and GMO where and then just like

209
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,639
the The Taste translated and it would

210
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,799
just coated your mouth and everything um

211
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:24,360
and then from there I I got onto blooper

212
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:27,759
skunks when they were released um I had

213
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,919
wrist surgery in between so when I had

214
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,799
wrist surgery I had a cast

215
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,078
on and my whole arm was up past the

216
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,599
elbow was immobilized so I couldn't

217
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,679
really do much for four months so I was

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,560
kind of just chilling and then got into

219
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:46,799
the blooper skunks um grew a bunch of

220
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,799
those was it your girlfriend hand yeah

221
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,559
unfortunately so I had to had to make

222
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,439
the other one stronger help me be idest

223
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,639
exactly

224
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:02,240
exactly yeah and then uh so then grew

225
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:05,360
out a few different things um in in

226
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,639
between there and now um the ones that

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,759
are most notable were Pock we're gonna

228
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,720
we're gonna get into like what like the

229
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,200
more detailed stuff about what you found

230
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,200
and like what you liked yeah so so I

231
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,680
kind of just been going on since uh

232
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,640
consistently since 2017 other than when

233
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,599
I had wrist surgery I had like the The

234
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,159
four-month Break um that

235
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,879
was

236
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,919
2020 like like right before the pandemic

237
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,559
happened so luckily that happened I was

238
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,879
in a cast and it wasn't like anything

239
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,159
wasn't a big deal but yeah that was uh

240
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,120
that's about it I

241
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:47,399

00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,039
grow when I was a

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,000
teenager and uh that didn't work out cuz

246
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,639
I know what to do and didn't have

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,039
anybody to show me or anything like that

248
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,919

00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,919
harvesting in

250
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,039
2011 and

251
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,680
uh I don't know I I wasted a bunch of

252
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:21,838
money on seeds from the

253
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,559

254
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,440

from you know like decent weed yeah and

266
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,319

267
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,399
for a little bit and so you you you end

268

270
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,120
bought yeah well not just Greenhouse but

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,078
Greenhouse was the ones I was banking on

272
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,560
I was like I'm going legit you know no

273
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,359
more of this because like I I started

274
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,719
realizing like man the problem is that

275
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,919
like I'm just popping like Mexican bag

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,639
seed I had no [ __ ] shot I didn't have

277
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,639
uh HID lights I was running off of those

278

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,360
that stuff and

306
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:58,559
uh yeah I didn't buy seeds again until

307
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,039
till I came back out of Hiatus cuz I was

308
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:05,958
just kind of helping friends grow since

309

when I when I got caught up and had to

323
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:54,278
stop for a bit like

324
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,639
I I started learning that cloning isn't

325
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,360
just about multiplication of like plants

326
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,240
it's like actually oh hey this this one

327
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,199
was better than the rest there you go um

328
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,720
so I didn't want to pop anything like

329
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,758
that I thought would be super special

330
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,199
yeah with even those packs those were

331
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,199
[ __ ]

332
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:19,000
too and then uh yeah I don't know I no

333
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,000
offense

334
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:26,439
H well I found you know I don't know I

335
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,278
found the the podcast started listening

336
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,959
and um

337
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,679
yeah I got some triangle choke seeds

338
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:38,278
from a friend uh that he got from one of

339
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,399
those one of those uh shirt that's right

340
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,720
yeah yeah yeah we had the shirt giveaway

341
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,799
seed

342
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,240
thing yeah so I popped those found

343
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:51,240
something I loved and I haven't really

344
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,759
stopped popping Syndicate beans since

345
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,079
yeah excellent yeah and the rest is

346
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
history yeah we'll get into that we'll

347
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,039
be getting into that and that'll be fun

348
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,318
because yeah I know you know the other

349
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:04,159
reason why I picked the three of you is

350
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,879
because yeah all three of you are great

351
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,318
Growers you've been growing stuff from

352
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,519
the crew for a while and so look forward

353
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:15,958
to hearing more about that as we go

354
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,720
on before before Kyle starts that Avatar

355
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,479
is my I have to say second favorite but

356
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,680
that was one of my favorite dogs that

357
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,000
I've ever interacted with and that was

358
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,599
kind of like me and Kyle knew who each

359
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,120
other were before like you know but like

360
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,278
I think that's how we became friends

361
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,959
friends was through that dog and cool to

362
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,318
see him there yeah for sure well that's

363
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:39,758
why I picked it so yeah excuse so

364
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:41,559
yeah that's pretty wholesome yeah go k

365
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,919
uh well I mean I'm pretty much a newer

366
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:47,318
grer uh man maybe five years um well

367
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,799
like screw I I'm tried maybe when I was

368
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:51,919
a teenager but I was been raising kids

369
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,599
for you know that's basically what I've

370
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,000
been doing so but I've been wi I've been

371
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
around cannabis you know basically my

372
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,440
whole life uh I've had family grow in

373
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,759
meno Sonoma uh some out in Virginia um

374
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,919
so you know that's uh pretty much it but

375
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,838
my first SE Bank uh I don't really

376
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,600
didn't really to deal with seed banks I

377
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:14,599
have my first seeds were from snow high

378
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,038
so i' I've really only dealt with uh

379
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,279
kind of that type of SE Bank they're no

380
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,558
real Dutch type stuff or anything like

381
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,199
that

382
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,199
yeah yeah pretty much and any SE banks

383
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,160
are ones you know that were uh Matt was

384
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,360
helping out and that's how I got a lot

385
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,720
of Matt stuff is basically I was trying

386
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,399
he's helping people out and I always

387
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,038
thought that was a cool thing that Matt

388
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,360
always tries to do and uh yeah so you

389
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,319
know that's and through um through my

390
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,279
seeds uh through my growing I started

391
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,519
out with the Rev so I do all T yeah

392
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,798
that's that's how I found about snow

393
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:51,119
high and Matt and Instagram and all that

394
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,918
stuff the lives um yeah that's basically

395
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,639
it and actually when I was and actually

396
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,400
when I was a teenager surprisingly how

397
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,480
it worked out is um I uh used to use the

398
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,000
um uh the Rev likes to do use nutrient

399
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,480
spikes and Miracle Grow actually had

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,359
them and that was one of the things that

401
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,240
I actually did when I was a teenager

402
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,719
because I thought hey that makes sense

403
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,880
why why do I want to feed it all the

404
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,558
time when I can just put it into the

405
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,799
soil and then just water it yeah uh and

406
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,960
so once I found his philosophy uh it

407
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:22,440
just everything fit for me and I just

408
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,240
been doing that and yeah there's no

409
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,880
reason for me to change basically yeah

410
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,000
right yeah I was gonna just say that's

411
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,679
right now I remember yeah you're doing

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,839
um T cuz uh bumat from our Discord

413
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,240
Community has actually been talking to

414
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,759
me about like a broad Organics episode

415
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,599
and I just have been struggling to to

416
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,919
think of people to include so maybe I'll

417
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,119
I'll I'll be in touch with you about

418
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,679
that for sometime in the future yeah I

419
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,399
really enjoy it because uh I'm getting

420
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,960
as a you know I'm not younger anymore

421
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,798
and I do construction so the Rev it's

422
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,600
small containers uh you know it's it's

423
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,440
it's real easy it's not a lot of heavy

424
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:02,199
lifting type stuff um so that fits my me

425
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,600
because I do night gardening so you know

426
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,319
it's hard for me you know to do a lot of

427
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,839
stuff sometimes once I get home you know

428
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,000
especially once I you know I gu it's

429
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,918
another job on top of another job

430
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,119
sometimes and that that's never fun

431
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,640
because that's not why I do this I

432
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,279
definitely do it for a passion and it's

433
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,360
what I like to do

434
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:23,558
so

435
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:26,399
nice Okay well I've Loosely divided this

436
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:27,879
talk into like three parts so the first

437
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,919
part is kind of meant to be like what

438
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,480
you've grown in the past then the second

439
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,880
part's like what you found and the third

440
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,120
part's meant to be like what else you're

441
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,760
looking for so more of the future in

442
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,038
saying that I know it's obviously hard

443
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,279
to talk about what you've grown without

444
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,079
talking about what you're looking for

445
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,000
but you know we we'll do our best to to

446
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,720
see we can kind of focus in these you

447
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,759
know from these different

448
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,519
perspectives so we're going to start

449
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,000
from what you've grown and I know you

450
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,679
guys have already sort of touched on

451
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,079
that but we could bring it back to Sean

452
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,960
because Sean was about to tell us about

453
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,720
you know blue PR skunks and all that

454
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,759
what are some of the highlights Sean of

455
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,600
of the things that you've grown um and

456
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,319
yeah just just kick it off and and I

457
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,038
think at this point I also invite all of

458
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:14,399
you to ask questions if you have any to

459
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:16,359
each other good call yeah so I guess

460
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,000
some of my favorites that I have grown

461
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:22,439
so far have definitely been the

462
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,279
blistering um the blooper

463
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:30,120
skunk uh the Blue Sour the blue

464
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,000
resin the Santa Cruz wreck that that

465
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:36,719
stuff's phenomenal um I found like this

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,798
this blue um Bubble tape kind of

467
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,919
feno um and then there was like one that

468
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:47,400
popped out that was just like this weird

469
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,200
Savory meaty rancid meaty kind of thing

470
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,600
oh wow yeah I don't it it was just weird

471
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,400
I I don't really know how to explain it

472
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,199
my nose kind of sucks too so I'm

473
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,320
probably so how someone else would smell

474
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,480
it they would probably be like maybe

475
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:03,119
that's not necessarily what it is is or

476
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:07,079
they'd pick up other notes yeah um and

477
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:10,119
then also Paco's sour skunk dog um

478
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:12,319
that's right yeah that was one of my

479
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,239
favorites of the the sour hybrids I've

480
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,119
grown and I've grown out probably like

481
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,038
10 10 different ones um of just like the

482
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,079
sour and the diesel hybrids over the

483
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:26,960
past two or three years and really the

484
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:29,359
the Blue Sour the Appalachian Diesel and

485
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,240
the sour skunk dog would be my three

486
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,079
that I would kind of just look through

487
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,599
the to find something um I really love

488
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:41,480
the the appy diesel um I threw out four

489
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:44,038
plants um one was all right the other

490
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,679
three I they're just like two were

491
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:50,919
really close um just really really loud

492
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,798
um just I could bring it into a room and

493
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,520
and people would smell it and and

494
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,720
immediately and kind of just asked like

495
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,599
what the [ __ ] is that um yeah and it

496
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,600
would have this just burnt

497
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:08,158
rubber kind of just rotten mango Funk to

498
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:11,519
it that translate completely The Taste

499
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,600
with the the high that's just uh hits

500
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,599
you and and you know makes you kind of

501
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,359
kind of dumb a little bit but it like

502
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,558
keeps you awake and it kind of just gets

503
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,240
your mind off of things and numbs your

504
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,119
body a little bit and just kind of stays

505
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,720
up in the head and doesn't really uh

506
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,879
doesn't really burn you out too much um

507
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,640
which is great like you don't have like

508
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:38,080
like the crash um and then the app f3s

509
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,400
were good um they're a little bit slower

510
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,678
veg for me than I I prefer um but

511
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,640
flavor-wise

512
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:50,000
um just really great I got this one that

513
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,200
was like a mango chem um so it I guess

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,679
it was more kind of Trace dog with just

515
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,798
like the the little bit of green crack

516
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:01,759
on the back end that kind of gave it a

517
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:03,519
little extra taste and flavor to it you

518
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:07,000
know

519
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,960
um then what else the original can I ask

520
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,440
Sean actually just before you go on what

521
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:17,840
what led you to these particular packs

522
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:20,000
with strains what were um so like good

523
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,918
diesel representations yeah I kind of

524
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,558
was looking for so I I also grew out I

525
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,919
was looking for like banana tie because

526
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:28,759
I always kind of wanted to do like a

527
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,559
little bit of just growing some seeds

528
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,000
and throwing things together that that I

529
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,480
would like so I was kind of going

530
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,319
through through all like the Diesels and

531
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,960
and and sour and stuff like that trying

532
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:42,759
to find a couple lines you know that I

533
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
would really like that I could then go

534
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,798
back through and how I kind of go and

535
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,520
purchase would be um I something I think

536
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:53,319
would be like really good or should be I

537
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,798
may buy like a couple packs you know for

538
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,439
but initially I if I'm not too sure

539
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,000
about I'll buy a pack and then grow it

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,278
out if I like it then I'll I'll buy a

541

543
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,960
back and and buying buying more just

544
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,599

for making seeds for my own and and

546
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,759

so he sent me some of the outdoor that

558
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,119
was just this like Juicy Fruit bubble

559
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:53,918
gum that reminded me of some wheat I had

560
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:56,918
when I was 17 uh yeah and like I skipped

561
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,480
school to go and get and everything and

562
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:00,159
um

563
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,159
and then the kid's dad comes home and

564
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,559
gets all pissed because we're like

565
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,360
smoking weed in his house and it's just

566
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,918
like this it I don't know it was fun

567
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,918
time so I wanted to kind of and then

568
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,960
that kind of brought the Nostalgia but

569
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,120
this banana tie had just like the most

570
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,880
amazing high it was just kind of just

571
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:20,079
really racy but not like anxiety

572
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,440
inducing yeah um which is is you know

573
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,720
what I really like and then just the

574
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,000
flavor and everything it was like this

575
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,399
juicy fruit bubble gum with a little bit

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,038
of a spiciness to it it and then he also

577
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:34,199
sent some shatter that was just all

578
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,798
Juicy Fruit Bubblegum and like this was

579
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,120
like

580
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:41,918
200 18 or 19 it was when your lives it

581
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,278
was when your lives I don't know when

582
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,880
your lives first started but it was

583
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,319
right before I guess it was like a year

584
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,278
2019 I

585
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:53,918
think when Cody was around yeah sometime

586
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,798
like 1819 yeah and so then I wanted to

587
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,520
you know I got a pack from you I think

588
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,599
the last pack of the F1 so I wanted to

589
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:03,240
you know try and find female to to keep

590
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,319
and then uh possibly use that or just

591
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,960
really just to have that so then I took

592
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,398
I didn't end up finding a female so I

593
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,880
ended up getting a male and I was like

594
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:18,719
all right let's just see what happen so

595
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I ended up pollinating blue resin um

596
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:32,360
some apocal Sour skunk dog uh a

597
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:35,720
NATO La lemon tree um NATO La TK from

598
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:39,479
CSI what else did I get oh uh Cherry

599
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,919
Berry yeah yeah hit and and those and

600
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,360
then I also hit the like I said the blue

601
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,000
resin um feel like there's like a couple

602
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,798
other things in there I can't I can't

603
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,359
remember everything they just didn't

604
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,639
really interest me all that much um but

605
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,759
I've grown out the blue resin banana tie

606
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,200
and got some really nice like creamy

607
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,480
blue and blue blueberry lemon and I

608
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,159
ended up with some of the more Blueberry

609
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,360
Lemon ones I ended up making some hash

610
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,559
from some boy that was sitting around

611
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,359
for you know four months curing and the

612
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,798
hash came out blueberry lemon um awesome

613
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,639
made some bubble hash and I've been

614
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,960
enjoying that a lot um and then the

615
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,600
Cherry Berry banana tie came out um I

616
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,840
only grew out three females I did a

617
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,079
small pop just to see what it was

618
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:31,519
everything's like really nice dense very

619
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:36,278
resinous to of the three fenos were

620
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:40,200
um they're like a Cherry Lemon and just

621
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:44,319
like this kind of like light green

622
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,200
with more of like a yarn like a rust

623
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,839
colored hair I guess and those ones were

624
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,360
are just really nice um I've given some

625
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,398
to some friends and stuff to try out

626
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:58,240
other than myself and they all seem to

627
00:27:53,398 --> 00:28:01,278
like them and then one was a purple feno

628
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,278
that uh kind

629
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:08,119
of was was more of like the Cherry Berry

630
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,960
um but it was purple so I'm guessing

631
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,678
that one was more um Cherry Berry

632
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,798
leaning super Frosty the high actually I

633
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,278
enjoyed more of that feno and ended up

634
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:23,879
smoking that one

635
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:25,798
first um so really most of what I've

636
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,640
bought and things like that I've kind of

637
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:32,119
wanted to to eventually find run through

638
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,480
things find things I I like and then

639
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:39,479
kind of mix them together um and enhance

640
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,319
the the the ones that I find so with the

641
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,880
banana tie doing that I was hoping to

642
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,918
pass on I was hoping the male would have

643
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,080
the you know the Juicy Fruit um tpine

644
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:54,120
profile and pass that along along with

645
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,199
the effects um so that was my goal I

646
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,439
haven't really

647
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,600
found the you know the juicy fruit

648
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,000
profile but and effect wise I couldn't

649
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,119
really tell you if it has passed on very

650
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,278
much but from what I've grown out I have

651
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,839
enjoyed it um I have you know seen the

652
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,880
nuances and and flavor profiles I I just

653
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:17,599
need to go back to those seats and grow

654
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,278
out more to to really see what's there

655
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,480
yeah um and everything but but like I

656
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,000
said you know I'm going from a male I

657
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,839
can't really if it was you know using

658
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,038
the female and going I would have a

659
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:31,558
better idea of what I'm trying to find

660
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:34,359
and this I was hoping you know it would

661
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,119
pass on certain things but and maybe the

662
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,558
other uh four things I have that I

663
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:43,319
haven't run yet something will pop out

664
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:47,839
of those um but we'll see about that um

665
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:49,720
yeah and then I guess so of my my top I

666
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,199
guess if I say the top three of of the

667
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,038
ones I have grown I definitely say

668
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,000
original sin that one's that one's yeah

669
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,839
everybody loves that one yeah I feel

670
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,759
like the crosses

671
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,558
uh it's Loompa loma's headband uh to

672
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,839
appy appy

673
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:10,240
F3 um and it's just like I haven't grown

674
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,038
out Loa headbands but I've seen it and

675
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,679
and seen what other people have said and

676
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:18,480
it's like a more

677
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:22,038
stocky and it's just like this pin

678
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,798
saww funk you know with a little bit of

679
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:27,599
like burnt rubber maybe in there and

680
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,960
there's some fenos that have that are

681
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,599
like a little bit of mango in there

682
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,798
instead of the the pinea and those ones

683
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,398
are just like really really good and all

684
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:39,398
the PO the potten and all of them um I

685
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:43,798
had four females all relatively close to

686
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:45,038
each other um and that's probably what I

687
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:47,240
or well not probably that is definitely

688
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:50,038
what I've been smoking on the most um

689
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,240
recently um and those I definitely want

690
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:55,879
to look through more and more but I mean

691
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,798
I found four that I was you know happy

692
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,799
with flavor-wise and effects with so um

693
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:05,119
I I know I didn't keep any because I I

694
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,720
have some work going on at the place I'm

695
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,319
at right now and keeping me from keeping

696
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,319
anything but then once the work's done

697
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:15,158
I'm going to go back to um the ones I've

698
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,398
really liked growing over the past you

699
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:22,399
know few years and then look into there

700
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,839
for Keepers to to then make some uh some

701
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,759
cool things with hopefully and then I

702
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:30,480
would also say I really love the appy

703
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:34,158
diesel and then the Cherry Berry the

704
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,960
Cherry Berry is really really good um

705
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,960
but man the blooper skunk and and

706
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,360
blistering too it's

707
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,120
just um the blooper skunk I got a lot of

708
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,359
like kind

709
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:49,638
of blue

710
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:53,199
like just buttery blue fenos and then

711
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:55,678
some that were like like really skunky

712
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,240
and then I got one that was like I don't

713
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,840
know how to how to describe it it was

714
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,839
kind of like a

715
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,440
blue like sweet tart kind of thing or

716
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,119
like an electric kind of blue thing that

717
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,080
ended up turning a little funky towards

718
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:13,239
the end um and I would just describe it

719
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,480
as best as like this is like electric

720
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,200
blue Funk and The Taste was just mouth

721
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,960
coating and T you know flavor just

722
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:28,240
translated and had this just really

723
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,440
really nice Mellow High um which I liked

724
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,240
about a lot of them I know I've seen

725
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,200
tests and stuff and a lot of people and

726
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,359
they test high but I mean I guess maybe

727
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,679
I I smoke a good amount but they didn't

728
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:43,079
like overpower me but they they did

729
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,000

814
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,679
smoke it's a no ceiling I can just keep

815
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,159
smoking get higher higher uh yeah yeah

816
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:19,759
it's just it's for me it's just i' I've

817
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:23,920
tested it pretty thoroughly I can't get

818
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,920
it to do Herm so it's pretty I want to

819
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,280
do work with it I've been trying I tried

820
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,920
my first reversal stuff uh I don't know

821
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,480
I don't think anything took but you know

822
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,760
that's how it goes and I only did one PL

823
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:38,280
so I I knew I knew failure was pretty uh

824
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,480
100% actually I figured I figured with

825
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,519
one PL but I figured I had one ready and

826
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,000
I just threw it in there uh to see what

827
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:47,358
would happen type of thing uh and I also

828
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,838
have another one I uh out of the pack I

829
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,480
I had got five and I got a pretty good

830
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,838
um Expressions especially from what Matt

831
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,639
has seen pictures of uh I end up getting

832
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,039
a cookies and cream one uh a few that

833
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,318
were kind of more of the dad uh from

834
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,239
what the pictures were that's on that

835
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:05,318
yeah that's the ones that you really

836
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,519
like as pictures yeah pictures are

837
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:11,400
beautiful yeah yeah yeah they definitely

838
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,800
the high it was okay uh wasn't there

839
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,838
what I wanted and and the turps it was

840
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,960
just kind of they the blend it when Once

841
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:20,519
stuff gets

842
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,440
muddled it's just it's kind of nothing

843
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,280
there's Bland ones inside that banana

844
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,159
tie and that's a thing like there

845
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,880
there's been um expressions in there

846
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,118
that I've definitely considered just

847
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,079
straight Bland like I don't know if it's

848
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,318
just the cookies that mutes it all but

849
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,160
it just goes Bland in some of them like

850
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,559
cardboard Bland but yeah we yeah yeah

851
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,480
yeah even though it's really they

852
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:45,599
smelled really good tropical mix like

853
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,240
there's nothing that was like banana or

854
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,920
anything they mix but then yeah once you

855
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:51,118
smoke it it was kind of yeah just

856
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,920
nothing no turpy wise but for me it's

857
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,800
always the effect I can I can get Beyond

858
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,079
tpps because I'm really old school so

859
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,800

860
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,000
stuff in my time because that's like

861
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,119
I've been smoking since uh uh basically

862

868
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,199
uh yeah I just really like the banana

869
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,719
thae um yeah and I just plan on working

870
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,199
that and keeping it so yeah yeah what

871
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,318
what other stuff have you grown in the

872
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,838
past that you you know you want to

873
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:29,318
highlight uh well my first thing I ever

874
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,279
did before I actually didn't get the

875
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,318
snow High seats first cuz he took a

876
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
little bit cuz uh he was waiting on

877
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:37,480
whatever I actually had ordered so I

878
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,679
actually had got CSI and it was a sweet

879
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Pig stink so that was my very first uh

880
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,480
grow line love that line yeah I did

881
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,318
three of those uh it was okay I just I

882
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,358
don't think I was the best obviously my

883
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:51,960
first Crow so looking back at the

884
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:53,440
pictures especially I'm like oh yeah

885
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,920
that's probably

886
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,760
why I didn't enjoy it so much but I I

887
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,519
still have half that pack uh but then I

888
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,640
did some perfect pearls those were

889
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,000
pretty good I enjoyed those and those

890
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,799
were ones of the few that actually my

891
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,639
wife she doesn't actually smoke but uh

892
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,200
she always smells Pine she's very

893
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,519
sensitive to anything Pine so basically

894
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:16,199
everything just smells weed Pine those

895
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,000
are ones she actually says and she

896
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,759
remembers was sugary sugary sweet so

897
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,719
those are ones so hard to describe Pearl

898
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,079
can you can you spell out what's perfect

899
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:28,078
Pearl who's it from oh so that's from a

900
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,318
souvenir uh SE

901
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,960
uh and that's the silver Pearl s1s and

902
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:34,960
these were his first release so uh you

903
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,838
know obviously I found out through Matt

904
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
obviously Instagram and you know I got

905
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:39,599
those as soon as they were available

906
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,919
actually I think that was through the

907
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,000
seed bank at the time and so I popped on

908
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,680
those really fast as soon as they came

909
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,679
up so yeah yeah that's one of my

910
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,960
favorite cuts that I've ever grown was

911
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,440
that silver Pearl cut that he used to

912
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,838
make the ones that's where I sourced it

913
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,159
same guy H uh yeah then uh see what else

914
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,799
uh everything else is kind of just a

915
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,199
random stuff I haven't really kept

916
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,400
anything uh too special there's some

917
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:09,719
people uh I've grown I'm not gonna

918
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,800
mention names um

919
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,358
yeah that yeah there's certain names I

920
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,160
just want like the certain seed banks I

921
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,679
just for me I just won't give them uh

922
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,078
this I just I just don't mention names

923
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:22,679
that's just you know it's just they're

924
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,720
not worth the time type of

925
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:27,399
thing let's see what else maybe one

926
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,679
thing I can ask you Kyle is uh did you

927
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,960
have a sense of what you were looking

928
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:35,719
for earlier on uh well for me uh I think

929
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,318
I was thinking recently that I think I

930
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:39,799
was searching for everything because uh

931
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,318
it was just this is such a passion for

932
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,480
me and I never grew that I G I have so

933
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,920
much now that I don't really know if I

934
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,519
ever have to buy anything anymore I need

935
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,039
to start kind of looking through what I

936
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:54,759
have yes um thanks mat and just Mak yeah

937
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,880
well I am making my own making my own

938
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,359
stuff because I know there's certain

939
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,318
stuff that people uh basically what I

940
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:02,440
look for is if everybody's doing one

941
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:04,358
thing I go the opposite so I know you

942
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,039
know right now everybody's kind of going

943
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:07,679
the blueberry in the Discord so right

944
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,599
now I probably wouldn't be glowing

945
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,879
blueberry type of thing so I start

946
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,680
looking in the opposite direction

947
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,160
because that's just that's just how

948
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,598
always how I've been for everything I

949
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,159
just kind of do the opposite of what

950
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,318
everybody's doing gotta keep it unique

951
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,480
bro well yeah and it's yeah it's kind of

952
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:22,519
you know but we're all going to see

953
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,130

955
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,240

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,400
oh yeah yeah so I got that one um yeah

975
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,280
and that's uh same thing with the tie

976
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,160
I've already put that through pretty

977
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,400
much uh good the pace and it hasn't done

978
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,759
anything it's hard for me to get it to

979
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,079
be mad and so I plan I like to mix that

980
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,480
with the tie because uh people say that

981
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,200
there's the Menthol camper nutty thing I

982
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,440
don't get that from mine mine is kind of

983
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,838
more just what I describe as hashy which

984
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,440
is just Bland there's no real flavor

985
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:38,159
it's just to me resin uh which I think

986
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,920
would be good with the tie because it's

987
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,199
just going to get add I would think more

988
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,880
more resin because the Sweet Pea is

989
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,679
pretty resinous and that everybody likes

990
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,960
the pictures and uh maybe a little bit

991
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,879
of structure but that I'm not too too

992
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,318
worried about but I think the mix would

993
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,880
be good yeah and and then and then the

994
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,279
high I think it would be good I think it

995
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,760
could be more an intense

996
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,760
uh with the legs is what I what I would

997
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,079
think and that's what I would be

998
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,599
searching for

999
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,599

[ __ ] good it's I mean three of the

1036

four

1037
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,440
females could easily have been kept just

1038
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:11,480
depending on like preference yeah but uh

1039

around jars and stuff like that

1042

um yeah we all kind of picked the one

1045
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:29,519

1046
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:32,239

really nice um it obviously it looked

1054
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,719

1093
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,079
the kind of thing that like uh we dream

1094
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,639
of more people doing I think in the

1095
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,240
community just like Shar like pulling

1096
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:57,279
your resources and time

1097
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,799
essentially yeah well we have uh like a

1098
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,119
little bit of like a geographic

1099
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,519
Advantage just because our city is so

1100
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,440
big you know like there's bound to be a

1101
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,159
lot of people in it that are growing pot

1102
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,358
you know

1103
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,000
um yeah it was it was just kind of like

1104
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:17,318
finding each other I

1105
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,599
guess that the hard part yeah it's hard

1106
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:22,679
to find people to trust in in any City

1107
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:28,760
you know to that degree trusting with

1108
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:28,759
