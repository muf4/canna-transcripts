oh like I said it's been a while since

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,620
I've looked at these and my memory is

66
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,179
bad now so this is the permanent way of

67
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,939
comp let's see

68
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,800
last time I don't remember what was in

69
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,620
this last time I looked at it but let's

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,700
see we've got it's a oh it's an epic

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,700
comp

72
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,500
and we have what the only ones master

73
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,238
switch oh the vibrators Judy that's

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,259
probably why I bought it

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,580
um one of the only ones the spike steel

76
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,840
another girl and other planets on here

77
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,459
so I probably would have brought that to

78
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,420
DJ too

79
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,580
after the fire curse off Liars

80
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,958

the diodes yeah there's good on

82
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,800
there so it's like a really not well

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,120
known

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,879
um 80s epic comp which yeah probably get

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,580
it pretty cheap if it's an old epic comp

86
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:19,979

compilation this is the dance Network I

92
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,479
believe that was Paul bevois and the Jet

93
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,919
Set uh ran that label you can correct me

94
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,199
if I'm wrong on that but that's what I

95
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,479
checked from it we are the mods volume

96
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,000
one

97
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,699

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,979
this is more recent put out but it's

99
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,719

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,500
roommate Brian P Miller That's how

124
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,899
everybody knows him by his full name

125
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,939
um originally gave this to me as a kid

126
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,339
and this is my introduction to mod

127
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,100
Revival

one it was real famous so yeah yeah you

132
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,698
can still probably get it fairly cheap

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
there's an extra copy right here without

134
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,520
a cover which

135
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,978
like it's one of the few things I would

136
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,418
keep without a cover catch or watch the

137
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,000
new watch The Wave that's what it is

138
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:30,599
this is I believe a Greek

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,180
um let's see Greek comp

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,740
or no It's Made in Great Britain so yeah

141
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,900
so this actually has like the head boys

142
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,379
the jam purple hearts

143
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,879
random hold the Cure sam69 the chords

144
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,978
and the passion so it's like a bunch of

145
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,439
mod Revival and

146
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,899
some punk in the Cure that's why I love

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,519
these old cops like sometimes it's it is

148
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,198
a bunch of music that I love regardless

149
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,599
if it's different genres somehow they

150
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,919
you know managed to do that

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
um through the back door if I can

152
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,000
remember I got this because of a

153
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,620
specific Donkey song on it

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,100
um yeah

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,399
got now live from Toronto the last Pogo

156
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,560
so this is the last Pogo

157
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,179
I can't really tell who's on it from

158
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,759
this angle but yeah it's there's great

159
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,500
bands on this one and that covers often

160
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,439
covered

161
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,300
and uh looks like this is oh no I can't

162
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,740
control myself team beat the same which

163
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,520
is very similar to uppers on the south

164
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,900
downs but this is actually I think yeah

165
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,599
I think it's the same thing with a

166
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,418
different name I need to look but I

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,479

whether you're a fan of screwdriver or

343
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,740

355
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,620
probably why I just grabbed it she

356
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,320
probably it's not something I'd run like

357
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,500
that this one is a Greek one

358
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,579

367
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,019
the is that you know

368

tends to be how a lot of these old great

369
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:39,959
comps go uh let's see what this one is

370
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:42,299
so troublemakers I think this is sire

371
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,518
or no Warner Brother

372
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,399
and

373
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,500
gang of four wire Devo so it's a bunch

374
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,419
of bands like that popular

375
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,419
popular

376
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:56,819
radio right

377
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,659
um The Logical steps can't see who's on

378
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,040
here

379
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,958
it's been a while since I looked at this

380
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,419
one this one was a

381
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,799
a recommendation from futon if I

382
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,360
remember correctly said this is when I

383
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,859
needed to get so

384
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,860
perhaps let's see what we got on here

385
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,980
Richard and the tax man doing Chinese

386
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,680
Takeaway

387
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,139
I know Richard and the taxman the dicks

388
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,379
the btp folders that that's what it was

389
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:27,440
I wanted this one for the btp folders

390
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,439
um vtp folders are like uh

391
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,559
ETP folders were a power pot fan has an

392
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,239
excellent seven inch and I swear to God

393
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,578
it wasn't going underground records on

394
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,220
the wall forever and nobody would buy it

395
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:42,539
but it was it's such good music that

396
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,000
it's one of those things where I just

397
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:48,179
don't get why it put in the name it just

398
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,039
didn't catch no questions no answers I

399
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,939
think this is just old

400
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,939

is the unissued stuff from hangman but

453

00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,279
I would have killed the like gone to

463
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,579

464

00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,339
like I love that and um yeah this

468
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,419
is some of my favorite music came out of

469
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,058
there here's another one Medway

470
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,520
Powerhouse rare and unissued it's

471
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:02,178
another one

472
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,179
um yeah

473
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,240
all in all like those those are again

474
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,620
really hard to find and they were hard

475
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,079
for me to track down but totally worth

476
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:13,199
it and here's one it's called 415 music

477
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,720
I see this all time VIPs on it good Punk

478
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,380
comp power pop and pump

479
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,480
um

480
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,059
dead B do a little vinyl so this is like

481
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,679
naked aggression and probably why I got

482
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,178
that

483
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,400
um what's this

484
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,798
Punk TV I think there was a

485
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,059
Captain jazz song on here and that's why

486
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,819
I grabbed this there's also another

487
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:35,099
seven inch in here of something

488
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:37,079
but there is a reason I grabbed that it

489
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:39,480
looks done with the surface like Punk TV

490
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,119
but there's a reason red starts this is

491
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,279
the futon grab

492
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,678
that's when he definitely recommended

493
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,599
let's see what we got on here

494
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,519
Dow Jones and the Industrials are on

495
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,139
here he knows I love that

496
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,058
um

497
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,520
I think desperate bicycles might be on

498
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,660
culture I don't remember but um yeah

499
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,400
that was definitely a futon

500
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,519

stuff like that okay

578
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,159
this should be easier because they're

579
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,900
not as packed as tight so I should be

580
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,500
able to get through this faster

581
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,298

Revival they are so good and yeah

591
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,759
there's not really that well known in

592
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,038
the US

593
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,140
badge

594
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,879
I found them because of the Japanese

595
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,100
mods if I remember correctly and that's

596
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,679
how I came across them the beat the Paul

597
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:01,319
Collins beat not the English Beat

598
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:04,880
there he is Paul Collins

599
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,879
and we have more Paul Collins

600
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,558
the butterfly collector

601
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:12,658

um

604
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
I think this is the girl who runs the

605
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,679
beat hotel that's a great album from

606
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,019

power stuff is that girl her into beat

608
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:26,038
Hotel uh paint house I think it's called

609
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,380
or the acid household now that's what it

610
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,119
is each one of these had an uh unique

611
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,700
cover that they did hand did which I

612
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:35,178

616
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,500
the girl that runs a beat hotel I think

617
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,740
this is like just some weird promo copy

618
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,940

619

622
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,000
the broken hearts

623
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,280
cheap time great band

00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,599
Chesterfield Kings New York classics

625
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,480
Johnny Thunders uh backing band when he

626
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,678
played uh so far away the chords used to

627
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,720
have all the chords and all the purple

628
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,220
hearts and all that but it was so common

629
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,500
to find that I eventually just got rid

630
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,380
of it never got it back cry Daddy's

631
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,359
probably had a few of these yeah good

632
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,600
like garage

633
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:31,099

636
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,640

637
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,379
my other dexy stuff is but it's not with

638
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,679

639
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,778
big Dexys fan it's the uh directions

640
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,419
it's a real one

641
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:53,579

642
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:55,340

646
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,380
the Medics this is just like a power

647
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,619
puppy song Spirit in the Sky they're

648
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,200
covered with power poppies the flu flash

649
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:13,500
I think that was a French mod band that

650
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,140
kind of sucked or by art

651

Gents

652
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,980
the head boys

653
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:23,099

654
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:26,579
Revival band you know very good r b mod

655

659
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:42,599

00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,079

00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,158
were ahead of their time too far ahead

690

of their time

691
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,600
really trying to do it beetles e ahead

692
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,359
of their time and yeah I think now they

693
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,959

737
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,298

And if they were amazing to me they're

777
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,360
probably amazing to everyone because I

778
