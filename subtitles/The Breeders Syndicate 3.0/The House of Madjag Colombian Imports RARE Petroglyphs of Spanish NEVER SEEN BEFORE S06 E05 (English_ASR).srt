12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,879
sneaky YouTube algorithm

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,980
leaving comments telling not to his

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,660
voice lulls you into a trance works as

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,519
well we hope you take the time to do

16

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,479
with everything around me

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,939
all of a sudden I just started

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,119
questioning everything I'd ever been

25
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,120
told

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,040
you know by the time by the time I got

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,040
high that very first time

28
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,819
started to hit me

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,940
and I'm like wow

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,320
[Music]

[Applause]

32
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,698
I got high

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,699
[Applause]

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,299
love that music

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,460
so first we're going to talk about

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,140
um something that's been going on

38
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,759
in the market you've been paying close

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,359
attention to which is

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,340
what's going to happen up to

41
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:49,920
and post legalization as it pertains to

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,478
other countries importing uh cannabis to

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,460
the United States

44
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,340
and we wanted to talk about some of that

45
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,739
I know a few years ago I started seeing

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,079
a lot of big Raiders start moving to

47
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:02,519
Colombia that's when I first noticed it

48
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,739
was about two or three years ago there

49
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,140
was a almost a mass Exodus of some of

50
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,280
the Breeders going down to Colombia and

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,000
a lot of people are trying to import

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,318
American strains down to Colombia I know

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,598
Bridger Steve was one of them down there

54
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,299
too Charlie Garcia those guys went down

55
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,939
down to Columbia yeah most of them told

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,459
me about Charlie in fact Charlie wrote

57
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,919
me too he was so sad with all the things

58
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,878
that had happened at Ace that he decided

59
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:33,000
to just go somewhere noon being Spanish

60
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:35,098
he would fit down there so well oh yeah

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,780
and I'll bet he I bet he's digging it in

62
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:38,939
Colombia and I bet they're digging him

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,979
probably treating him like a dignitary

64
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,359
you know really yeah like royalty I

65
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,579
would I would assume he's been around

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,459
forever he's done a lot you know and and

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,379
that would be a huge fit down there

68
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,539
and he knows a lot of people so that

69
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:54,299
when it comes time to Market

70
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,699
you know he knows how to do that is

71
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,680
Colombia I don't really understand the

72
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,399
Colombian Market as much but is Colombia

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,860
as controlled by cartels as say Mexico

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,019
is currently

75
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,360
I don't believe so I think the

76
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,158
government has stepped in by legalizing

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,140
and

78
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,899
they

79
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,419
they monitor everything they I'm sure

80
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,879
there's money being passed around to see

81
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,899
who gets what licenses because that one

82
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,899
article

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,900
said that there's only

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,340
there was how many I said that there's

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,819
only like 16 or six that were allowed to

86
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,780
produce seeds yeah but there was a lot

87
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,560
of

88
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,439
um licenses for Growers yeah 60 or 70.

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,739
so only 10 percent roughly

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,598
were allowed to uh produce seeds so

91
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,299
they'll be producing their own down

92
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,098
there and with someone like Charlie or

93
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,640
breeder Steve they'll get up the right

94
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:59,280
genetics design you know though yeah and

95
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,259
I'm sure that that Charlie's

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,620
searching in the

97
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:07,318
back jungles and Corners to find it's

98
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,060
close to land races as you can oh I'm

99
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,738
sure I mean he's he'd be one of those

100
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,840
ideal people for Colombia I think

101
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,379
because he understands

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,079
um different types of of uh

103
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,579
not just not just strains but types of

104
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,699
strains how they grow in certain

105
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,379
provinces and certain certain elevations

106
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,360
so I think you'd be excellent for that

107
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,100
like like finding a strain and he

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,379
understands breeding he understands

109
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,759
working a line acclimating it so I yeah

110
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,279
he's a great person to be down there

111
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,020
doing it I'm kind of shocked that

112
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,819
there's so few people allowed to produce

113
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,879
seeds I don't know that the U.S market

114
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:46,079
has a cap on the number of seed

115
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,060
producers uh licenses and stuff

116
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,180
I think it's kind of late if if there is

117
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,418
going to be yeah I mean yeah yeah

118
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,819
there's tens of thousands yeah there's

119
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,698
so much to could they be so brilliant

120
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,759
that they're realizing that the future

121
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,660
for their seeds would be if they're

122
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,120
certain lines like Chiba or Santa Marta

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,240
gold and they can regulate and make sure

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,939
that the six readers of seeds

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,319
really have that so that when they sell

126
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,160
them

127
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,659
uh it could be

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,639
Thailand's done something similar kind

129
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,039
of as I understand it's something

130
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,860
similar with their Heritage strains like

131
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,599
the silk squirrel tail the Tiger Tail

132
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,979
snake teeth there's a few other kinds

133
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,220
from Thailand they consider like

134
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:37,918
Heritage strains however they put a lady

135
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,600
in charge of it named I don't want to

136
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,339
see her name a lady in charge of all

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,900
this stuff and

138
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:44,758
um it seems that she doesn't even

139
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,379
understand that most of the ties that

140
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,840
were sold during that era were lay

141
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,939
oceans so she she's putting out like

142
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,638
this big thing where like almost

143
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,079
reparations that American farmers owe

144
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,400
Thai people money for growing Thai

145
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,740
strains and using them over the years

146
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,899
when in fact they'll probably lay ocean

147
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,120
strains so her bringing this forward

148
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,038
will kind of probably point out that

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,780
most high strains or laotians and that

150
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,579
probably the Thai is oh reparations to

151
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,559
lay oceans if she keeps pushing it that

152
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,879
direction because she she just doesn't

153
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,038
understand the culture she doesn't

154
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,339
understand the history of the strains

155
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,620
but she's in charge of it and I think

156
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,478
it's it's disappointing because I feel

157
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,538
like that happens a lot in corporate

158
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,639
Canon America uh obviously in Thailand

159
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,339
is is that you have corporate money

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,978
coming in and corporate money

161
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,538
choosing who is to head The Who

162
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,139
spearhead these

163
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:39,779
these campaigns and most of the time the

164
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,879
people with the money and incorporations

165
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,099
do not have access to the people who

166
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,159
have the knowledge or have been keeping

167
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,840
this clandestine stuff you know uh

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,220
keeping track of it the archivists they

169
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,500
just don't have access to these people

170
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,300
or even know so

171
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,978
they wait to be approached by these

172
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,259
people who tell them I am that person

173
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,899
and it almost I almost feel like they do

174
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,520
they have no way to check do checks and

175
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,739
balances on if this person's full of it

176
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,379
or not and it's almost like a to me it

177
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,660
feels random on who they choose like uh

178
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,339
you're gonna be the lady you know like

179
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,280
you're going to be the guy to represent

180
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,679
it and um I know a lot of Thai people or

181
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,239
people in Thailand right now

182
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,579
um that are super interested in land

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,280
races and preservation are a little

184
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,198
upset about that because I mean now

185
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,879
she's representing certain strains as

186
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,699
their Heritage strains that may not even

187
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,339
be they could be you know Dutch hybrids

188
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,660
of stuff and they will always be pushed

189
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,098
into their Heritage straight now because

190
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,180
she said so

191
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:38,819
hmm

192
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,199
yeah it's it's fascinating the politics

193
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,000
that go behind

194
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,740
all this stuff because you never really

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,060
realize how much it's going to affect

196
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,400
potential future written down history

197
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,060
so I found the article from April 12th

198
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,758
of 2019. so we're talking two years ago

199
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,439
and it says there's a hundred and twenty

200
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,220
six

201
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:06,180
um companies in Colombia at that time

202
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,199
that's two years ago but only 16 for

203
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,360
seeds

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,379
oh wow yeah 126 had been cleared to grow

205
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
and have

206
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,899
huge but only 16 of those 126 were

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
qualified to produce

208
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,159
um cities since these companies are

209
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,739
allowed to register genetics in batches

210
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,660
of 10 at a time and the phytosanitary

211
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,180
tests will mandate them to cultivate a

212
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,158
test batch engage its properties before

213
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,879
it can go to the market or register the

214
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:38,038
genetics several well-known land race

215
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,200
strains will be featured

216
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,939
so they are going to try to do that um

217
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,379
that Heritage strain type thing that's

218
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,660
kind of cool

219
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,439
yeah Santa Marta goal

220
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,059
um

221
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,040
Chiba

222
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,139
black hopefully hopefully they choose

223
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,579
someone like Charlie to spearhead that

224
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,299
that would be cool someone that actually

225
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,240
knows their their business or or God

226
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,859
must have Funk or someone cool you know

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,100
I know he's not here but it would be

228
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,200
nice to consult

229
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,339
I'm pretty sure they'll need testers

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,940
no yeah that's for sure yeah

231
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,820
um

232
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,160
so what do we know about the what do we

233
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,459
know about the political climate in in

234
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,500
Colombia as far as so we talked about a

235
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,458
little bit about cartels in Mexico how

236
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,860
does this how do you think this

237
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:28,018
interplays with moving the product from

238
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,399
Colombia through Mexico because it's

239
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,899
going to have to pass through Mexico to

240
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,059
get to the US unless it's done on

241
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,980
airplanes right

242
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,419
um yeah I guess I guess I I don't know

243
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,700
why I would assume that they can't do it

244
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:41,360
on airplanes if it's legal though I'm

245
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:46,620
still living like that Outlaw mindset

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,060
the 747 pack yeah UPS like the way UPS

247
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,700
will pack

248
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:54,000
certain carrier planes you know they own

249
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,300
them and use them but that size sure and

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,159
then they'll be they'll be perfectly you

251
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,879
know protected you know they'll keep

252
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,778
them

253
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,519
oh I'm sure they may vac seal them I

254
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,899
don't think the glass bottle and like

255
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,519
some of the

256
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,019
Boutique companies in Northern

257
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,080
California but they'll definitely

258
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,159
they've learned their lessons over

259
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,100
decades so

260
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:20,159
and they may have some that they ferment

261
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,980
on purpose and help

262
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,659
bring about changes in the Smoke

263
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,459
qualities

264
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,379
it'll it's

265
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,539
I don't know when it'll be but once

266
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,399
we're federally legal

267
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:34,500
I bet they'll have their lobbyists

268
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,919
already waiting and already had their

269
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,679
plans made it may even right now and

270
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,539
when it happens they'll Rush In And

271
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,819
there'll be all these companies in

272
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,620
America fighting saying we need to have

273
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,720
tariffs we need to have tariffs and stop

274
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,399
them coming in

275
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,860
um so it'll be interesting

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,440
Washington DC battle

277
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,000
you know it almost I mean it kind of

278
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,260
would be common sense that a lot of

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
these companies because we know a few

280
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,679
years ago that a lot of people moved

281
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,700
down there and started doing this that

282
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:09,799
they are in these what were once cartels

283
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:12,720
maybe or maybe what is backed by

284
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,639
clandestine money in Colombia and and

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,300
Mexico

286
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,699
um

287
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,500
they have way more money than a lot of

288
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,120
the the corporations and it is what I've

289
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,759
been trying to tell people like a lot of

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
the the people that are in the US right

291
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,480
now

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,360
um a lot of the major companies Let's uh

293
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,899
for example schmungel schmoys

294
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,120
um something like that level of bigness

295
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,500
and they may not have enough money at

296
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,240
all to be able to compete with the

297
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,278
international market I mean that's just

298
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,560
a fact I mean we're not talking you know

299
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,000
the hundreds of millions of millions of

300
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,859
dollars that we have in America to

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,320
invest in some of these cannabis

302
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,480
companies you know we're talking like

303
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,000
billions and trillions of dollars being

304
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,980
invested and a lot of these people look

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,019
at these companies that were started by

306
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,600
actual Growers some into some cases

307
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,179
getting investments from uh you know

308
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,100
doctors lawyers chiropractors that money

309
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,019
is not going to hold any weight when

310
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,420
these guys come in it's they're going to

311
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,940
get crushed because there's no way it's

312
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:14,219
just by simple economics I mean

313
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,260
um the way it works is you know if

314
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,000
someone has x amount of space and it's

315
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,919
10 times the space that you have and

316
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,240
they can sell it for pennies on the

317
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,740
dollar compared to what you can afford

318
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,659
to sell it at

319
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,820
and they can afford to take a loss for

320
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,759
10 years there's no way to compete

321
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,839
that's just how all capitalist markets

322
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,679
work

323
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,540
um in a new in a new market where

324
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,099
I guess you could say this this is not a

325
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,319
new commodity but it's going to be

326
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,000
considered a commodity in a broader

327
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,579
sense for the for the world term that

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,200
people can uh invest in it's going to be

329
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,479
a commodity like pork bellies or

330
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,940
anything like that and and when those

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,220
come into play it dumps out any

332
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,100
mom-and-pop chance of being able to ever

333
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,540
compete again if I was in charge of a

334
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,278
big cannabis operation in the United

335
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:02,219
States I definitely have my

336
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,559
representatives in Colombia Thailand and

337
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,000
tropical areas right now which I

338
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,638
wouldn't doubt

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,379
um if Spain has such a large presence

340
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,200
down there from the people like Charlie

341
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:15,000
that are the Growers then there's they

342
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,740
have friends who own stores and

343
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,839
companies in their countries there's

344
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,299
plenty of millionaires and there's quite

345
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,180
a few billionaires these days

346
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,278
um yeah why not you know it makes more

347
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,759
sense in South America I guess or Mexico

348
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,919
or maybe even Thailand for the cartels

349
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,379
that are doing other things illegally

350
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,139
you know pain and opium and then they

351
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,360
make billions of dollars and now they

352
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,820
can put it into something legal it's not

353
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,339
washing their money it's like it's

354
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,800
beautiful and wanting the money to

355
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,180
retirement so how do you think Mexico is

356
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,338
going to interplay

357
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,199
um in this whole transition I know you

358
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,079
know I mean Mexico is a bit behind

359
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,579
Colombia as far as uh how people are set

360
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,319
up there

361
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,879
um the politics are going to be much

362
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,620
different I I don't know how much

363
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,078
different I don't know the level of

364
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,379
political corruption in

365
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,259
um Colombia but I'd imagine it's

366
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:12,659
somewhere or on in between Mexico and

367
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,720
the us as far as corruption and politics

368
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:18,059
so I I just wonder with

369
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,879
with the powers and the money that the

370
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:23,219
cartels have in Mexico

371
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,019
how they will

372
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,820
how they will be prepared to enter the

373
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,679
market because with all that land in

374
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,899
Mexico and as cheap as land is in Mexico

375
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,759
I mean it seems like that and the

376
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,139
climate are the determinant factors on

377
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,240
where a person can grow cannabis

378
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,700
essentially on where these Farms will

379
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,500
start popping up around the world

380
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,500
Gustavo Petro

381
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,440
is a former Guerrilla fighter and he is

382
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,720
now the president in Colombia and that

383
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,279
makes a big difference because he's

384
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,740
going to

385
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,320
he has a much different view much more

386
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,480
down to earth he's not like the high-end

387
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,278
Only Money person

388
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,839
being yeah

389
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,659
um it says he

390
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,339
is it an economist politician but he was

391
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:08,399
a former Guerrilla fighter

392
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:12,680
and he's been in prison since 2022. yeah

393
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,958
Mexico has too much corruption in Murder

394
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:18,479
yeah Colombia in the kidnap capital of

395
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,500
the world but Mexico is far and above it

396
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
now

397
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,399
because

398
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,399
I don't know it's just so split into so

399
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,919
many factions when you had only four big

400
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,220
Godfathers and godmothers in Colombia or

401
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,019
five it was very organized but Mexico if

402
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,019
you look at all the cartels

403
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,519
yeah maps that show like 25 different

404
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,198
ones and they're they're trying to

405
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,778
combine and then others are fighting the

406
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,859
others I I think Mexico will lag far

407
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,198
behind

408
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,220
however it's so close to the United

409
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,859
States

410
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,320
that will have a spillover beneficial

411
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,959
effect for them just like think

412
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,019
automobiles everything was Ford and

413
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,838
Chevy and then suddenly Toyota and all

414
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,419
these other countries I mean German okay

415
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,880
Volkswagen was always here too and BMW I

416
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,099
guess but suddenly

417
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,078
when the Imports started flooding to the

418
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,959
United States they came in with some

419
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,819
great quality and stole away a lot of

420
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,619
the market and now they've been playing

421
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,240
catch-up for years before it in the

422
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,698
Chevy yeah

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,100
with electrifying it's going to be

424
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:25,979
interesting because Tesla kind of broke

425
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,600
the ground but now there's companies in

426
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,300
China that make electric cars that are

427
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,740
seven thousand dollars yeah it's gonna

428
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:35,338
be hard to compete with that

429
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,198
even if we tear fit 100 14

430
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,399
000 for an electric car just to use in

431
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,159
your neighborhood and around shopping

432
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,458
and stuff yeah those will sell like

433
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,919
crazy oh yeah yeah affordable affordable

434
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,719
electric yeah that'd be insane I mean

435
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,039
you know what's funny is uh you know I

436
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,440
collect a lot of different things that

437
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,360
I've talked about and in the over the

438
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,980
years I've watched the guitar Market

439
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,800
specifically

440
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,959
and the knockoffs that have come and how

441
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,299
fast the turnaround time is on Guitar

442
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,698
knockoffs now is literally it went from

443
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:08,818
probably five or six years from a model

444
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:11,160
being released to where you were able to

445
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:13,500
buy that model

446
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,679
um bootlegged in China pretty easily you

447
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,660
know for 300 to 400 as opposed to ten

448
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,360
thousand or fifteen thousand you know

449
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,140
that much yeah oh yeah that much of a

450
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,578
difference

451
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,720
um because they're doing like they're

452
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:30,779
doing like Custom Shop like like artist

453
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,120
Edition versions like perfect replicas

454
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,440
that you can get and sell for 500 bucks

455
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,418
because they're doing it in Mass but

456
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,038
they're doing it so good

457
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,320
um and now they're down to they're down

458
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:44,220
to about two months two months after

459
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:48,119
each uh uh line is released for guitar

460
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,740
maker if it's a high selling line

461
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,659
they will have it knocked off in two

462
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,579
months now as opposed to six years

463
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,919
there's no turnaround time whatsoever

464
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,178
it's crazy and I'd imagine

465
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,538
um it's like that with a lot of stuff

466
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:03,000
China's able to reproduce and produce on

467
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,859
such a level and on such an affordable

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,679
level that we couldn't even begin to

469
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,899
understand over here six cents a gram

470
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,519
production price they're predicting in

471
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,200
Colombia

472
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,119
um I think we're going to see a replay

473
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,419
in the weed Market

474
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:21,058
Mexico could certainly compete in their

475
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,520
more tropical areas like Oaxaca and

476
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,779
Guerrero because people live in the

477
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,359
mountains and they they grow their own

478
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,700
beans and it's a much simpler life like

479
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,699
much of Colombia Colombia has some big

480
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:37,019
cities though and yeah a port on the

481
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,240
Caribbean and a port on the Atlantic so

482
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,579
they can ship right from the Atlantic

483
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,460
side right up to LA or San Diego or they

484
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,859
can ship right to Miami from

485
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,759
you know Buena Ventura I think it is the

486
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,418
one that's by Santa Marta and it you

487
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,519
know

488
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,960
they could pick up a little Jamaican

489
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,839
along the way you know yeah right

490
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,640
because the Jamaica by the way son do

491
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,980
you do you ever see a country like China

492
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,100
entering the the Cannabis Market based

493
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,599
on culture and religious aspects

494
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:08,480
not for a while

495
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,279
I I don't know

496
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,579
Thailand and look at all of Southeast

497
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,519
Asia you know kalamantan and you know

498
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,859
the guys on the forums from Australia

499
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,619
certain people you know Wally duck and

500
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:26,178
bucket bong and a few a bunch of others

501

Dutch citizens well hippies they it's

505
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,538
just more difficult of a society to just

506
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,400
go over there I know Rob Clark's been

507

00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,500
If he if he'd let me there's some

516
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:11,220

a 50 kilogram fish in his arms oh my God

518
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,860
looks like Papa Hemingway he's got white

519
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,120
hair now and white

520
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,740
he's in his rubber clothes because he's

521
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,798
on the beach you know pulling these in

522
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,960
and he uh he loves it that's his thing

523
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,179
and apparently Shanti Baba

524
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,700
and he were thinking of maybe even

525
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:34,200
getting a little tiny Resort

526
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:37,880
in former Borneo calamenton yeah

527
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,880
who knows wow

528
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,440
yeah right over to some place where the

529
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,200
people running it were

530
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,298
long-time friends that'd be really cool

531
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,220
I mean longtime friends and Seed nerds

532
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:53,279
like stray nerds that you just sit there

533
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:56,038
and nerd at me yeah it'd be amazing

534
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,639
I wonder if it would never be the time

535
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,819
that Americans can go to Colombia and

536
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,440
not get kidnapped or bothered because

537
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:07,798
from you know someone from Spain

538
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,058
speaking perfect Castilian Spanish you

539
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,779
know they're going to fit right in but

540
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,519
yeah Americans are still viewed I

541
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,379
believe in many of the countries like

542
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,720
south of us

543
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,520
every everyone's gonna

544
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,919
someone's going to be willing to pay for

545
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,798
you if I can exactly yeah maybe it's

546
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,679
only 10 grand and not 10 million like if

547
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,538
you were really special that I don't

548
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,880
know maybe it's only 400 you know but

549
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,859
that's that's months of of someone's

550
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
livelihood there and that's enough for

551
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,019
them you know what I mean

552
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,880
yeah

553
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:46,740

guy was staying with a lot was with the

585
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,700
Huns of people and they just seemed so

586
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,099
nice and friendly just wonderful

587
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,500
wonderful culture

588
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:09,418
I have a little booklet I got in the

589
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,079
health food store in the

590
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,179
early 70s on the whole hunza story and

591
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,879
their diet they eat a lot of apricots

592
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,759
which has a lot of benefits and

593
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,940
they're they don't eat a lot of meat if

594
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,740
they do it's probably goat meat uh yeah

595
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,058
lots of yak yeah yeah

596
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,980
and hunza Valley until maybe 10 years

597
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:35,158
ago was very difficult to get to you had

598
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,259
to Trek for A's to get there now I know

599
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,960
there is a road that leads in there

600
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:43,798
however the people are probably still

601
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,200
just as friendly they called it like the

602
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:49,139
Garden of Eden like it was a paradise

603
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,019
hidden and these people lived in Perfect

604
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,659
Harmony and whatever they have

605
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:58,918
um different districts different little

606
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:02,700
Regional uh voting areas well not even

607
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,400
voting like people in charge that were

608
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,380
voted in by their their tribe because

609
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,419
they were such good people so it was

610
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,240
good good

611
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,640
yeah it it I know that um the dude who

612
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,220
went there it was mostly because of um

613
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,600
the whole Shangri-La story like he was

614
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,400
trying to figure out like where where

615
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,158
this was kind of considered or where it

616
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,659
was just going in that area and yeah I

617
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,460
if I remember correctly it was either

618
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,260
the Hunts of people or

619
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,900
um somewhere close to there where they

620
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,599
were saying they're not Muslim so they

621
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,120
are looked at as second-hand citizens

622
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,779
not really quite

623
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,019
um

624
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,178
they're not given proper representation

625
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,558
in Parliament and Pakistan and stuff

626
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,259
like that because they're not a Muslim

627
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,058
culture and yeah I thought that was

628
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:51,720
absolutely fascinating that this little

629
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:54,839
tiny Bastion of like free people exist

630
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,759
in their own little area in Pakistan and

631
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,678
they're just so sweet they seem sweet

632
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,058
you know I never been there but they

633
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,240
seem sweet

634
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:05,639
but I was thinking about the uh kogi

635
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,759
people who were all white and they live

636
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,159
in the Santa Martin mountains there's a

637
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,679
a beautiful

638
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:17,220
movie that came out maybe 20 years ago

639
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,380
and it's called Uh message to little

640
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,298
brother I think was the name of it I I

641
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,679
researched this the other day again and

642
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:25,798
it's about an hour and a half long

643
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,000
documentary and you can't go into the

644
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,278
kogi

645
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,919
highest Villages they they have been

646
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,900
blocked on these paths up into the Andes

647
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,179
you can get that far but they won't let

648
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,759
you be on that and wow they have the

649
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,940
right too because it's their land and

650
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,940
they they consider everyone else in the

651
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,700
world like us little brothers and they

652
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,220
were this was in environmental movie

653
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,679
showing how they have noticed the snow

654
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,200
is no longer on top of Santa Marta there

655
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,538
it's the weather is changing and and

656
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,840
it's because of little brother not

657
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:03,960
knowing what he's doing and talking with

658
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,699
nature and right next door is Venezuela

659
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,400
and there's parts of Venezuela and then

660
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,819
going to Guyana that are un almost

661
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,880
unexplored

662
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:18,720
that's the upper end of the Amazon

663
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,400
which is also very little unexplored and

664
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,519
fortunately there's people helping the

665
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,159
tribes there maintain their lands and

666
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,139
hold back the

667
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,559
people who chop down the rainforest to

668
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,000
make the palm oil plantations

669
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,859
really

670
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,900
it's amazing

671
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,819
we live in interesting times that's for

672
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,400
sure I

673
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,158
I look forward to seeing Santa Marta

674
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,640
gold coming in original it would be so

675
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,980
cool or oaxacan some strength of oaxacan

676
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,020
that no one knew existed because the

677
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,000
people there were guarding it yeah

678
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:57,119
became legal and they were no longer

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,339
criminals they had friends who were in

680
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,199
the city who knew how to bring it and

681
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,298
yeah it'll happen

682
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,460
I I still think that there's a good shot

683
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,558
that we have these Colombian Golds and

684
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,480
oaxacans even in the in US seed

685
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,000
collections I'm sure you know even even

686
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,179
with Rob Clark and and um

687
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,980
and others like that you know uh Watson

688
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,659
I'm sure they have these old stuff I

689
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,519
mean Watson said a million times that he

690
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:24,120
has everything that he's ever touched

691
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:26,158
and see stored frozen forever so you

692
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,538
know I I hope that they do bring these

693
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
back out and grow them at point of

694
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,440
origin type places you know like grow

695
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,119
them go take it back to Columbia grow to

696
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,820
point of origin bring some of this

697
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,899
natural stuff back that that has been

698
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,439
wiped out

699
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:43,259
that'd be cool

700
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:47,100
one 1977 guerreran seed

701
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,658
that a friend found in his desk it's not

702
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,558
viable

703
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:55,200
and down the road with the advances in

704
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,418
PCR and DNA and RNA

705
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,580
it's very possible they'll be able to

706
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,820
deconstruct it just by breaking the seed

707
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:05,879
and taking the remnants of whatever's in

708
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,759
there and the genetic code yeah and

709
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,100
re-engineer it uh I don't know if this

710
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,798
is good I think it's very possible you

711
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:17,158
know it's GMO you know so it's very very

712
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,900
possible I mean it's it's not easy like

713
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,340
it shouldn't imply that it's easy but

714
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,200
it's definitely very possible to take

715
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,639
something that has its genetic code and

716
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,860
if they understand the genetic code and

717
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,340
how to reinsert it it'll take years to

718
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:32,038
understand the DNA map of cannabis and

719
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,158
what goes where and why but it's at some

720
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,720
point they should be able to to have a

721
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,460
um would you call that like a blank

722
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,919
canvas type seed that they can inject

723
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,600
this code into I I definitely think

724
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,659
that's in there in our very near future

725
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:48,359
and something like that will be

726
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:51,539
absolutely so important to have

727
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,519
tissue culture yeah it's at a Cutting

728
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:57,058
Edge right now and the company that's

729
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,379
really the most advances in Canada and

730
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:01,918
they recently opened in the United

731
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,860
States I contacted them maybe a year two

732
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,860
years ago called them in Canada and they

733
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:10,379
said at this point having a Single Seed

734
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:13,019
like that it isn't feasible but it's on

735
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,659
its way and they feel very confident

736
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,720
that they will be able to take a seat

737
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,840
like you said and

738
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,700
somehow take what's left in it and

739
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,038
inject it into tissue culture and then

740
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,740
grow it again and then

741
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,259
cross it and make new seeds of the exact

742
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,759
same string so

743
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,798
hmm

744
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,980
I think it's not too far out

745
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:41,460
no I don't think so at all Kerry Mullis

746
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:45,298
is the cool guy he was a surfer too who

747
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:48,538
invented PCR basically and oh really and

748
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:51,898
he died just a few years ago

749
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:55,558
he wrote a really cool book that I have

750
00:29:51,898 --> 00:30:00,839
and he did a lot of acid when he was in

751
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:04,139
college and he more or less saw the RNA

752
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:07,379
helix or whatever on acid and that's

753
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,860
what allowed him to then make the final

754
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,820
steps and make PCR real and he worked

755
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:17,579
for a company at the time so they got

756
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:20,700
the got the patent for it

757
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:23,699
he got the Nobel Prize of chemistry that

758
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,500
Year by the way and his friend said you

759
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,960
should just quit your job and then do it

760
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,099
on the outside and he estimated it would

761
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,079
be worth

762
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,579
this is 20 years ago when you wrote this

763
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,199
book I believe he said it would have

764
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:36,658
been worth about a quarter billion

765
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,759
dollars that oh I'm sure and today be

766
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:42,799
worth probably 20 billion dollars you

767
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:45,480
know because PCR is used in everything

768
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,339
yeah that's how it goes when you work

769
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,159
for a company they own you and they own

770
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,599
your they own your soul all of these

771
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,899
books are non-fiction almost every

772
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,538
single one I have probably 40 50 fiction

773
00:30:54,898 --> 00:31:00,000
books but yeah

774
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:02,339
and now with the internet I can skip

775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
most of these books however there's

776
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:08,459
still my friends right I can't let go of

777
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,960
this stuff like every move that I do is

778
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,058
insane mostly because of my book

779
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,579
collection it's insane it's heavy

780
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:16,440
there's so many boxes of books but and I

781
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:17,639
know a lot of these are online but like

782
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,620
at the same time there's a lot that

783
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,140
aren't you know and there's the ones

784
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:24,178
I've been trying to scan in and get out

785
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,759
there for people because I really have

786
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:30,298
this this fervent belief that like in

787
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,740
order for us all to progress and get at

788
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:33,179
the level to where I wish people were

789
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,220
when it comes to breeding and cannabis

790
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,899
breeding and taking it seriously we all

791
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,278
have to be have access to the same

792
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,678
information and be on the same playing

793
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,298
field to have you know expectations of

794
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,940
people to put in the work and to know

795
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:46,558
what's what so if I'm not making that

796
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,240
available and I have the resources too

797
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,178
then I'm part of the problem that's the

798
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,058
way I look at it it's weird but yeah so

799
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,100
I I'm determined to get it all scanned I

800
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:58,558
had 10 feet of National Geographics at

801
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:01,038
one point because my grandfather gave me

802
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:05,339
a subscription when I was nine years old

803
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:07,500
and for the next 15 years and then when

804
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,359
he died a friend of mine picked up where

805
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,359
he left off and kept sending them to me

806
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,778
but once it went digital and I realized

807
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:19,019
you can search every copy yeah for what

808
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:22,019
I need in my life I gave mine to the

809
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:24,019
Boys At Girls Clubs and it was 600

810
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,220
pounds

811
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:27,898
and I was so happy to give them away

812
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,480
because they would use them to cut out

813
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,678
photos and yeah yeah collages or do

814
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,839
whatever they're doing in their class

815
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,820
and that was fine

816
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,099
that's the best

817
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,678
but um now in High Times that's a

818
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,819
different story I'm give those to the

819
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,919
Boys and Girls Club

820
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,480
[Laughter]

821
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,360
definitely going to hold on to those

822
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,200
yeah you need to those are special I

823
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,639
mean

824
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,480
share them with people like you and

825
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,220
other friends yeah like since since high

826
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,240
times has put the whole archive online

827
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,940
like I have several and but I still find

828
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,519
myself picking them up every time that I

829
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,500
see them for whatever and I'm like man I

830
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,538
know I can just go access it online but

831
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,419
there's something about having a hard

832
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:15,000
copy from the 70s being able to smell it

833
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,580
and flip the pages and re there's

834
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,859
something about that that I'll never be

835
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:23,939
able to walk away from smell of books

836
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:27,359
the feel of books also

837
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,580
I underlined I I'm not keeping a book so

838
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,439
that it'll be valuable later unless it's

839
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:34,980
one of the ones I collected as first

840
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,740
editions so I index my books and I hope

841
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,179
you open the front page and it's got my

842
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,778
index

843
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,778
and

844
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:47,220
this is just a small one where I you

845
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
know I wrote that many things

846
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:55,319
like page 91 it's about shin splints

847
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,019
page it's about ligaments and yeah

848
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,319
it's just that's what the beauty of

849
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,319
books

850
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,119
you know I never um

851
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,059
I've never really taken notes in books

852
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,960
but I had a uh or notes on books period

853
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:15,119
I always memorized what I could and I I

854
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,918
when I was doing a lot of UFO research I

855
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,800
ran into a guy that just blew my mind

856
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,838
because every single book he had a long

857
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,700
list of everything he had ever read

858
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,199
about it and and he'd be like have you

859
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,460
read this book no here here's my notes

860
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,739
and I'd be able to read it real fast and

861
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,480
I was like this is so useful if I would

862
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,638
have done this for every book that I've

863
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,179
ever read I could be helping a lot of

864
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,159
people like real fast yeah so now I'm

865
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,159
making a habit to do stuff like that to

866
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,220
make notes to you know

867
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,919
well I think it's super important

868
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,959
this is probably the best book on it's

869
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,480
called The Rocks begin to speak

870
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,579
and it's by Lavan Martino and about

871
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:00,358
petroglyphs yes and but this guy

872
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:02,719
um he was raised on

873
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:02,719
his

874
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,838
background he's part native American and

875
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:09,259
he was raised

876
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,259
and

877
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,019
this is how I index my books oh wow you

878
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,379
know

879
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:23,039
all the all the pages that have

880
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,760
things word order Clarity you know like

881
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,759
yeah

882
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,599
a lot of archaeologists thinks he's full

883
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,700
of it

884
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,579
he's no longer alive

885
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:39,659
however he was the first to start

886
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:43,760
like he said rocks broke the silence and

887
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:46,440
I've used his techniques personally in

888
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,839
even a Mad Jack Cannon there's lots of

889
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,880
petroglyphs and yeah

890
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,679
there's one that's very Sim simple

891
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,300
that's just a circle with a dot in the

892
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,519
middle of it and it means something

893
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,280
there and

894
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,719
you see this in the Rock and he said he

895
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,019
walked around the Boulder and on the

896
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:07,980
back side there was a spring

897
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:10,199
wow they had anyone in it didn't matter

898
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,240
what language you spoke they all spoke

899
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:19,139
sign language or Rock writing language

900
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,519
and it's it's incredible I and if you go

901
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:22,199
to other countries like Central America

902
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,940
South America

903
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:29,159
Asia there's petrobus or pet you know

904
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,200
hieroglyphs all the glyphs in the world

905
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,699
um it's just wonderful to me I think

906
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,960
it's amazing there's stuff like that to

907
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:35,699
even be found in the United States

908
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,260
because the United States like when we

909
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:39,358
think about our history we think of it

910
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,359
traditionally being you know 600 500

911
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,519
years old from um the European Conquest

912
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,679
but realistically like like you said

913
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,239
magic there is a beautiful I I've never

914
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,159
seen petroglyphs in person but I can

915
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,199
imagine the energy the

916
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,139
the vibrations around stuff like that

917
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,598
has got to be magical

918
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:00,118
one of my favorites that I've found I

919
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,519
think I sent you a link to the nfts I

920
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,099
made because I was

921
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,259
searching when nfts first came out a few

922
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,140
years ago it was a big and I searched

923
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:13,140
openc and wearable and all these sites

924
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:16,679
and no one had done anything with with

925
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:18,960
weed I yeah I found one finally one

926
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,480
photo of a of a flower

927
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,900
some guy had posted on open seat but

928
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,559
yeah I think all kinds of stuff and wove

929
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,639
them together and one of my favorite

930
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:31,619
most rare

931
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,598
petroglyphs I've ever found with my

932
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,800
first grow partner Doug the second

933
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,338
actually

934
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,780
um

935
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:39,059
showed

936
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,200
men on horseback

937
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,599
and

938
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,338
it was early conquistadors because they

939
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,760
have helmets

940
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:50,400
and it's it's a fairly rare thing to see

941
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,520
there are a few in northern Arizona and

942
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,380
Utah as well but this is

943
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,380
not in magic

944
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,059
came in proper but five miles away on

945
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,640
top of a Mesa where it drops off into

946
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,559
another Canyon my friend and I were

947
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,059
hiking over to look over the edge and

948
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,338
see these other Canyons we were

949
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:11,820
considering other growth spots and we

950
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:15,179
found this and it's um it's pretty

951
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:18,359
stunning to see a horse shape and a guy

952
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:20,819
on it and he's got a helmet and this

953
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,219
dates back to the first conquistadors in

954
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,440
the 60s them documenting seeing these

955
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,059
guys come through or like I'm trying to

956
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,639
figure out what they were seeing

957
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,500
in the 1500s and 16s because they

958
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:33,299
conquistors went through Arizona all the

959
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,519
way up to the Hobie reservation they

960
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,380
came also from Santa Fe which was their

961
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,739
Capital at the time

962
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,400
and Mogan was one of the first Spanish

963
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:46,919
Governors so the mogiano's

964
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,079
Juan Ignacio Flores moyon

965
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,039
no I didn't know that

966
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,680
yep he was for four years in 16 like 10

967
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,679
or something he was the governor okay

968
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:02,219
yeah and you can see they're on horses

969
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,838
clearly and their human humanoid forms

970
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:05,578
and they all have

971
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,880
headdresses on

972
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:11,300
and the the horse was introduced as you

973
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,920
know by conquistadors to North America

974
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,820
and

975
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,039
they were

976
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,300
stolen many times I don't think they

977
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,639
were traded that often because they're

978
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,980
too valuable in the early days but

979
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,500
Native Americans got some and then

980
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,780
the Plains Indians I mean they were

981
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,179
there was hunt hundreds there's tens of

982
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,800
thousands of wild horses at one point

983
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:33,118
you know just like there were millions

984
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,460
in Buffalo

985
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,559
and they were the the main ones but to

986
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,199
go over rough Terrain in the west the

987
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,119
conquistors yeah

988
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,118
they don't show up in many petroglyphs

989
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,019
the books that no and this one is

990
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,720
beautiful

991
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,579
yeah it's almost like a freeze frame of

992
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,959
of one of them talking like looking back

993
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,820
and talking to one of his other people

994
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,740
like that they you know what I mean like

995
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,900
giving them orders his hands up

996
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,819
directing there's

997
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,619
three clear ones

998
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,260
yeah marching almost there and then

999
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:07,440
below that at the back left it looks

1000
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,079
like another human feature like he's on

1001
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,780
a horse perhaps too or he's falling off

1002
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,940
and then below it's difficult to see I

1003
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,980
have the larger version that shows this

1004
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,380
whole Boulder this section you're

1005
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,240
looking at here is about two feet wide

1006
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,640
and wow

1007
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,319
well three feet wide and two feet tall

1008
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,379
this

1009
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,900
photo is uh but each of those horses

1010
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,079
petroglyphs are about I'd say eight

1011
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:37,858
inches tall maybe ten wow yeah when we

1012
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,180
saw that we were like oh my gosh because

1013
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,699
you know

1014
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:43,679
they're not existing documented in any

1015
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:46,319
Petroglyph books this picture that

1016
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,639
you've taken no and I've been wanting to

1017
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,338
go

1018
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,440
um get with my friends at Coconino

1019
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:55,460
National Forest

1020
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,139
but I've known them for 40 years the

1021
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,300
archaeologists there there's a new head

1022
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:03,239
archaeologist Peter pilis was the

1023
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,740
previous archaeologist and

1024
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,618
he

1025
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:09,719
loved Petra Bliss too

1026
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,480
there's two huge sites outside of Sedona

1027
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:16,019
honaki and palatki palatki's open to the

1028
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,579
public honakis uh where tours go and

1029
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:19,739
they walk you through and they describe

1030
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,200
stuff and Peter came down once and gave

1031
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,939
a three-hour class that I was fortunate

1032
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,759
enough to be a part of with three other

1033
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,440
people and oh wow they went over what

1034
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,119
they were saying about stuff and then he

1035
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,480
told them if they're full of [ __ ] or not

1036
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,480
and they were 90 totally wrong

1037
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,119
this is the Sean's cave and he said well

1038
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,579
actually in the sonawa which means

1039
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,680
without water that's the nickname the

1040
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,440
ancient people of the Verde Valley he

1041
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:53,279
said there was no no

1042
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,960
documented signs of shamanism at all

1043
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,640
oh

1044
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,260
the Shaman's cave because of the

1045
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,838
petroglyphs that were associated with it

1046
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,579
so then he would go through and then say

1047
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,440
what was more likely

1048
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:07,619
um it was an excellent

1049
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,700
and I was I wasn't I had already been a

1050
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:13,320
grower 20 years before I met Peter and

1051
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:14,939
and he uh

1052
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,700
I shared some things with him but I

1053
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,099
never took my Petroglyph book I have all

1054
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:24,179
these and as photos which I've since

1055
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:26,760
digitized as you can tell here yeah

1056
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,598
I was stunned never ever and I've been

1057
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,359
to

1058
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,859
a newspaper not newspaper rock but this

1059
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:35,219
big one that's up near the hope you're

1060
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:38,219
is in other areas

1061
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,219
fascinating

1062
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,179
one of the largest

1063
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:47,219
in northern Arizona is called newspaper

1064
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:49,199
rock and it it was a site that was used

1065
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,539
for many years

1066
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,059
people would add to it and add to it and

1067
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:56,539
it was like a newspaper they akined it

1068
00:42:54,059 --> 00:43:00,059
to because it had so much information

1069
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:03,119
that was obviously packed into the rock

1070
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,880
over many decades not just one person

1071
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
sat down for two years didn't you

1072
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,660
graffiti

1073
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,818
this is this takes to do one of these

1074
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:14,460
figures this is called

1075
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:16,259
this patina is called desert varnish and

1076
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,780
it appears on rocks as they get older

1077
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,839
certain types this is volcanic rock and

1078
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:25,079
it gets this brown or blackish patina

1079
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:27,239
and to Peck into it it reveals the real

1080
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,720
color of the lighter Rock underneath

1081
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:33,239
but it takes hours and hours to do one

1082
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,338
of these you're using another rock in

1083
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,439
your hand that's hard like maybe a piece

1084
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:41,400
of granite or something and make a point

1085
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,280
so that you can Peck the design you want

1086
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,838
so yes this might have represented more

1087
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,900
than one person

1088
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:52,019
leaving their information over many

1089
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,940
years it's hard to say I yeah I think

1090
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:55,880
the top three at least are the front two

1091
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,659
here were probably

1092
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,180
simultaneous

1093
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:03,299
in one stretch maybe in a maybe they

1094
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,919
spent a week doing this who knows

1095
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,200
you know I just think like the part that

1096
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,480
catches me is is the guy in the Middle

1097
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,039
with his hand up like director like that

1098
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,099
because it's like it's almost like

1099
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,199
obvious that he was the boss whoever it

1100
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:18,380
was they were portraying him as the boss

1101
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,879
he may have had a stick in his hand to

1102
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,880
whip the horse with you know because

1103
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,818
they didn't have oh yeah

1104
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,740
so it may have been they were portraying

1105
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:30,659
that he had something he was hitting the

1106
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:32,239
horse to make it go faster so I don't

1107
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:35,639
know that's true

1108
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:37,919
but the Spanish used either that would

1109
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,598
be another interesting thing to study

1110
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,440
it's definitely saw something on his

1111
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,019
head

1112
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,800
oh yeah and the guy up front here you

1113
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:48,780
know had these rival tribes in the

1114
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,900
Plains Indians they were lots of

1115
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,839
headdresses but that was the late 17s I

1116
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,019
think or maybe mostly in the 1800s these

1117
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:00,659
are going back to 15s and 1600s when the

1118
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:03,599
first horses came through in the sonawa

1119
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:06,299
and the mogulan people saw them

1120
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,460
yeah passed through and they were just

1121
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,839
like what the heck are those yeah yeah

1122
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,659
they didn't even know what horses were

1123
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:16,199
right no no can you imagine it'd be

1124
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:18,960
mind-blowing right let's see a horse

1125
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:19,980
any humans on top of them just riding

1126
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,280
them around

1127
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,199
wearing armor and helmets and because

1128
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,500
they were worried about getting shot by

1129
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,719
arrows yeah how quickly though like the

1130
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,000
Plains Indians adapted to be able to to

1131
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,919
or Native Americans were adapted to be

1132
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,838
able to ride horses and became very

1133
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,900
proficient Horseman

1134
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:43,318
bareback too yeah amazing it's just

1135
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,900
amazing how they adapted to that oh it

1136
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,920
helped them hunt and made their life

1137
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:51,480
easier

1138
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:54,960
yeah I I they call them dog soldiers too

1139
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,420
um the people that rode the early horses

1140
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,280
they were they they were comparing

1141
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,139
horses to large what does it feel like

1142
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,780
to be around these petroglyphs did you

1143
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,000
get any like I know it's it's kind of

1144
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,240
hard to quantify spiritual spirituality

1145
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,579
and feelings and stuff but did you ever

1146
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:14,159
get any kind of

1147
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:16,140
spark of energy or any kind of sounds so

1148
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,420
weird saying that but did you ever feel

1149
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:19,318
anything around these petroglyphs of

1150
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,338
note

1151
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:23,880
um

1152
00:46:20,338 --> 00:46:25,619
yes but it's hard to quantify like you

1153
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,480
said Sending

1154
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,818
next to a fire

1155
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,679
we we made underground fire pits so that

1156
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:34,199
the Flames wouldn't be visible sixteen

1157
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,779
hundred feet above us was a small Pueblo

1158
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:39,899
the Bruins have just two foot walls but

1159
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,800
the outlines created made about 20 rooms

1160
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:47,220
and wow and down below the boulders that

1161
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,760
next near the creek that had the some of

1162
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,559
these petroglets had outline of that

1163
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:56,339
structure you know 16 rooms little

1164
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,259
squares so they they had some very

1165
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:01,019
interesting communication and the field

1166
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,960
was that next near the creek that had

1167
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:07,318
the some of these petroglys had outline

1168
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,740
of that structure you know 16 rooms

1169
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:13,199
little squares so they they had some

1170
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:14,639
very interesting communication and to

1171
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,699
feel

1172
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:20,578
well to be growing weed in the middle of

1173
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:22,858
all that was very um very powerful if we

1174
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:25,019
had my battle Farm where and just had 10

1175
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:27,239
acres it'd be cool

1176
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:30,659
but being surrounded by this and at

1177
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,939
night hearing a creek flowing by and

1178
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:36,659
Bears smashing through the bushes and

1179
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:38,760
stuff it's like the only thing that

1180
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:42,480
divides you from the people who wrote

1181
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,640
those messages is time and like what a

1182
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,838
small barrier in some ways and

1183
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,239
understanding

1184
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,818
yeah and understanding yeah so I'd like

1185
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,279
to talk to you about one thing and this

1186
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:56,460
is um something that I feel like it like

1187
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,640
I talk about it a lot but I'm younger so

1188
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:03,059
even in my generation it was almost a

1189
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,818
loss or unless you were into uh maybe

1190
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:07,799
tattooing or even Plumbing or part of a

1191
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:11,759
union job or something like that which

1192
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,500
is apprenticeship learning a craft under

1193
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,599
someone

1194
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,420
um learning

1195
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,619
learning the The Apprentice meant

1196
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,539
Apprentice Mentor role where you snap to

1197
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:26,338
it do what you say you know because

1198
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:28,440
you're learning

1199
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:31,259
um and and how that applies in modern

1200
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,039
days and and how much of that is missing

1201
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,319
now

1202
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,059
in your time when you wanted to learn to

1203
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,858
grow were there guys that you could

1204
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:40,679
Apprentice under how would you have

1205
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:44,279
found an apprentice in the 70s

1206
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:47,639
let's say or 60s uh to learn to grow in

1207
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,400
76 when my dealer friend from Tempe said

1208
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,199
let's grow our own and I went sure

1209
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,599
um I already had a green thumb as far as

1210
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,939
I worked on five acres of garlic with

1211
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:00,539
some other hippies and Cottonwood

1212
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:03,240
Arizona and I love taking care of plants

1213
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:05,639
in my yard Vines anything that could

1214
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:08,639
make it pretty and beautiful

1215
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:09,779
I planted a few trees already so I kind

1216
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,539
of knew

1217
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,960
soil culture a bit comfortable to step

1218
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:17,699
in then yeah and yeah what I didn't know

1219
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,460
is anything about

1220
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:23,338
the needs of cannabis as it grew and

1221
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,858
especially when to harvest it and how to

1222
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,318
Manicure it you have to try it manicure

1223
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:31,318
so that was self-taught with my friend

1224
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,900
he had never grown either and luckily we

1225
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:36,619
had the Growers guides and later

1226
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:41,400
marijuana botany and all these fantastic

1227
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:43,318
so I frequently say the word

1228
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,920
the written word has always been my

1229
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:48,539
guide and my mentor I I would buy books

1230
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,260
and books and books on everything and

1231
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:54,300
just read and get ideas and ways to do

1232
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,060
it uh

1233
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,579
I didn't Apprentice as a carpenter or

1234
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:01,259
plumber or anything like that today

1235
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,359
you know with the Advent of more

1236
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,319
artificial intelligence doing other

1237
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,779
things

1238
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:10,619
really if you can fix air conditioners

1239
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,640
or heaters or Plumbing or electricity or

1240
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,260
buildings

1241
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,960
you're not going to have to worry until

1242
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,579
it's like George Jetson time and your

1243
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,720
robots that can walk around and do

1244
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,099
everything

1245
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,259
um I don't know that that day is going

1246
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:26,338
to come but

1247
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,319
probably will yeah maybe 50 years from

1248
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:30,059
now or 30 years I don't know they're

1249
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,920
they're creating robots to fight other

1250
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:35,059
humans which is stupid or other robots

1251
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,700
but yeah um

1252
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:42,119
you know being an apprentice to a great

1253
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:46,019
mentor would be fabulous

1254
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,539
um I know people who have gone to work

1255
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:50,280
in Colorado at Big rows and learn the

1256
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:54,179
basics and after a couple years they

1257
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,280
come home and they they've learned what

1258
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:58,199
they needed to know to feel confident to

1259
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,000
do it themselves

1260
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:02,759
but so if we

1261
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,980
but jumping out yeah like you mentioned

1262
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,079
if you're not invested in it and you

1263
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,659
haven't put 10 or 20 years in

1264
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:13,019
you you can always just quit like you

1265
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,699
mentioned and walk away whereas someone

1266
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:17,159
who's spent a whole lot of years

1267
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:21,179
learning how to refinish furniture or

1268
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:23,519
build furniture or anything uh

1269
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:25,618
I have a nephew who's learning about

1270
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,019
furniture right now and he's refinishing

1271
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:32,400
it and starting from scratch but I don't

1272
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:34,259
think he has a teacher other than

1273
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,780
Maybe YouTube

1274
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,000
you know and that's that's a legitimate

1275
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,040
method of learning now that wasn't there

1276
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,739
when we were you know doing stuff oh

1277
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,779
yeah oh yeah I was gonna change out my

1278
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,459
headlights and my Tacoma because they're

1279
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,400
10 years old and they're they're fading

1280
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,679
and I've bought 3M cleaners to put on

1281
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,160
you know and wipe the glass it's not

1282
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,598
even glasses it's polycarbonate and it

1283
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:02,879
works for a while and then it goes back

1284
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,519
to being bad yeah so I looked online at

1285
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,800
a guy who shows how to replace them and

1286
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,719
there's like 10 different electrical

1287
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,059
connections and if you could take a

1288
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,439
photo every time you got to a certain

1289
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,660
spot you're going to pull this one off

1290
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,300
and this take a photo and then when you

1291
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:20,519
pull it out take a photo yeah

1292
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,140
I get to a dealer and paid them to do it

1293
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,179
took them an hour and a half to put two

1294
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:27,779
new ones in it would have taken me two

1295
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:30,000
days oh my God man I might have made a

1296
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,220
mistake and then have to troubleshoot

1297
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,559
which wire did I leave off or put on the

1298
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:37,259
wrong one yeah no

1299
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,240
um it wasn't so it cost 150 a light to

1300
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,420
have them do it and it was worth every

1301
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,338
penny so I bet those guys who did that

1302
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,818
in an hour and a half they apprenticed

1303
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:50,338
for many years yeah mechanics who could

1304
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:54,659
do stuff like that I'm in awe of I never

1305
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:56,578
really next to that level no

1306
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:59,159
of course I ever did was change of

1307
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:02,880
starter in my Volkswagen van I did that

1308
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:06,299
myself I felt very proud I bet I used to

1309
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,160
have a 66 bug and um the idle pin would

1310
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,559
always mess up so I learned that if I

1311
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,299
got duct tape and a pencil eraser and

1312
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,859
put it on that idle pin that it would

1313
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,960
fix it every time that's about the most

1314
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:19,558
auto mechanics I've ever done as the old

1315
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,559
eraser yeah

1316
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:26,219
you uh turn it on its head and found a

1317
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:28,519
workaround which I did which I've seen

1318
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:31,679
some great mechanics back in the days

1319
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,780
that could do the same thing and duct

1320
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,519
tape man

1321
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:38,099
and bailing wire Gotta Have bailing yeah

1322
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,358
so when you think you're off road and

1323
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:42,440
you hit that muffler and it's hanging

1324
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:45,900
you can strap it back

1325
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,300
so there's also

1326
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,619
the idea and this this kind of goes

1327
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,099
along with the idea of mentorship

1328
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:56,579
apprenticeship and it's becoming a part

1329
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,119
of a group

1330
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:00,240
um

1331
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,140
for example when you become a part of a

1332
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,199
forum

1333
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:06,598
when the Forum days were around and big

1334
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,759
you know ever I I remember my first time

1335
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,400
coming on the forums and

1336
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,980
trying to figure out how first what am I

1337
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,440
what do I say without looking stupid

1338
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:19,440
right how do I integrate into this group

1339
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,059
that I don't quite understand some of

1340
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,460
these subcultures like I was a punk rock

1341
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:26,280
kid in my area growing up I don't really

1342
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,559
relate to the deadhead Community very

1343
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,599
much but that's a lot of this community

1344
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,359
is the hippie community so I've got to

1345
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:35,519
learn to integrate and communicate with

1346
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,440
people I've never really integrated with

1347
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,619
or communicated with or understand their

1348
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,358
cultural subcultural level and

1349
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:44,039
um we don't really seem to have that

1350
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,679
anymore what we have are social media

1351
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:48,779
where you just blast out whatever you

1352
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:52,078
know but back then you had to integrate

1353
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,780
yourself into a group to gain access not

1354
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,599
even to gain access but to to learn from

1355
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,460
each other and at that point you know to

1356
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,500
share then Cuts were shared between the

1357
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,659
group because you trusted each other you

1358
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,460
knew each other you know and it was over

1359
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:07,318
a period of several years where a lot of

1360
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,019
these groups and friendships were formed

1361
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:12,599
and bound and I I talked to the guys

1362
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:14,880
today like in my in our patreon Discord

1363
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,039
group and I see how some guys try to

1364
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,900
assimilate you know and some don't it's

1365
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,940
just it's very different than the Forum

1366
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,740
error where you where you watch these

1367
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,960
personalities kind of try to assimilate

1368
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:27,118
whereas now it's just like

1369
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,740
lots of clashing personalities all

1370
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,539
falling on top of each other and nobody

1371
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,479
really understanding assimilation into

1372
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:36,659
groups it's very fascinating you mean

1373
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,039
like I see maggas yeah yeah exactly it's

1374
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:39,598
it's a bunch of personalities all

1375
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,659
screaming at each other as opposed to

1376
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,420
like a group working together I see Mac

1377
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:47,219
had the great you know um SD's finest

1378
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,519
group that did pretty cool the San

1379
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:53,098
Diego's finest cuts on icmap those guys

1380
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:54,900
did really good for a long time

1381
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,220
um but they're so far and few between I

1382
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,660
mean you have the land race groups on

1383
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:00,239
icy mag that all kind of pulled together

1384
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:03,420
you know over time and they have some

1385
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:06,598
good groups and uh yeah they all had a

1386
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:09,240
huge following Tom Hill eventually got

1387
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:12,000
so fed up with all these um people

1388
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:14,299
hounding him and he

1389
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,059
he would just blast people

1390
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:20,099
was one of my early Heroes of the floor

1391
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,660
just because he didn't like it's not

1392
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:23,338
that he would just go off on people that

1393
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,500
wasn't it was that he would do it and he

1394
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:27,119
was right and he was correct when he was

1395
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,940
saying it you know and he was a

1396
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,640
geneticist he could put the top of him

1397
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:35,700
if he and Rob Clark were sitting down or

1398
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,739
someone who really knew genetics well he

1399
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:39,779
he would have no difficulty you know

1400
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:41,779
talking about back Crossing and

1401
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,760
just all the different

1402
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:46,200
mathematical formulas involved so you

1403
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,180
knew what how many would be this how

1404
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,699
many would be that way what Gene

1405
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:53,159
Expressions would you expect yeah I love

1406
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:56,279
that it's beyond me

1407
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,858
um I can kind of grab the concept

1408
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,859
if I'm growing a hybrid

1409
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:03,598
and I have 10 of those come up and I

1410
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:06,058
look at them I'll see differences in

1411
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,099
them I'm not sure I could scientifically

1412
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:12,140
say well one quarter we're going to be

1413
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:15,200
this cross you know and or Express these

1414
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:18,000
recessive genes and you know whoa yeah

1415
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,159
it's something else yeah yeah trying to

1416
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,300
have conversations with him is is very

1417
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,539
humbling

1418
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:27,059
so on a burrito level you can go going

1419
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:29,099
back to the uh apprenticeship imagine

1420
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:31,980
being an apprentice

1421
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:34,380
Petroglyph artist in the Native American

1422
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,358
days or someone who made projectile

1423
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,059
points whether they were

1424
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:40,920
spear points for the Paleo Indians ten

1425
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:43,980
thousand years ago to run up and kill

1426
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:47,099
Buffalo or the Archaic Period that came

1427
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,659
next and they were adult points that

1428
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:52,200
were looked like large arrowheads and

1429
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:54,299
they would boost a spear thrower spear

1430
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,219
and then finally the bow and arrow

1431
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,780
showed up in the southwest and little

1432
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:01,019
tiny points

1433
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:03,300
which are sometimes called bird points

1434
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,679
they had to be very tiny and sharp and

1435
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,140
and lightweight because they're going to

1436
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:08,879
be shooting through the air on a stick

1437
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:11,639
and if you put a big point on there

1438
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,900
which at 11 points are the that Arrow

1439
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:14,358
would just go

1440
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,559
40 feet

1441
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,838
yeah yeah so

1442
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,059
those to find

1443
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:23,400
to find their ancient work on the ground

1444
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:25,980
when you're hiking is mind-boggling too

1445
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,619
to know how long it would take to be an

1446
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,760
apprentice and get skilled at making

1447
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:32,400
those

1448
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,160
when they had such a tough life to live

1449
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,960
every day that they couldn't just take a

1450
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,358
whole day to make points unless they

1451
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,380
were special and they were so good or

1452
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:42,960
maybe

1453
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,338
women they they

1454
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,798
believed that there was great women

1455
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:49,380
Point makers too because they didn't go

1456
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,079
hunting as much yeah and they were

1457
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,358
taking care of the home front and

1458
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,700
they would have possible time at least

1459
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:59,578
before the Advent of

1460
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:01,019
people growing crops and porn yeah where

1461
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,640
you had to be out you know taking care

1462
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:05,759
of the plants and

1463
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:08,098
stopping animals from eating them wow

1464
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,410
we've covered a lot of territory today I

1465
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:13,530
love Petroglyph stuff dude like

1466
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:13,529
[Music]

1467
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,200
[Music]

1468
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:22,279
oh man it was like it was like I was

1469
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,539
connected with everything around me

1470
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,940
all of a sudden I just started

1471
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:29,179
questioning everything I'd ever been

1472
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,179
told

1473
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:36,960
you know by the time by the time I got

1474
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:40,818
high that very first time

1475
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,818
when it started to hit me

1476
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,610
and I'm like wow

1477
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:45,318
[Music]

1478
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:48,798
[Applause]

1479
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:48,798

Raiders Syndicate update not only is our

1482
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,579
merch store up at syndicategear.com but

1483
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:11,519
all episodes will remain free but what

1484
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:12,780
we need from you is interaction if

1485
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,719
you're watching the show for your first

1486
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,940
time kick back and enjoy it if you like

1487
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:20,399
the show feel free to like it but if

1488
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,900
it's your second viewing we ask a gentle

1489
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,000
person's agreement that you click the

1490
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,280
Subscribe button it costs you nothing

1491
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,199
but it helps us tremendously with the

1492
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,420
sneaky YouTube algorithm

1493
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:32,578
leaving comments telling not to his

1494
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,260
voice lulls you into a trance works as

1495
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:36,180
well we hope you take the time to do

1496
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,040
this we try to put out the best possible

1497
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:40,318
shows for you we can and want to build

1498
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:43,880
