okay so we wanted to start out last week

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,579
or of two weeks ago we ended with part

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,140
one we went over the introduction of

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,119
smell boat seeds kind of how it all

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,420
started how small boat came to be what

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,280
it meant what the word even meant and um

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,899
and some of the naming conventions of

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,820
some of your lines we went over rainbow

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,558
we even touched a little bit on your

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,780
brother at the end which I'm sure people

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,878
were like surprised that we'd even cover

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,939
and then we talked a little bit about

25
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,960
what we didn't cover what we missed like

26
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,518
some of the other things we wanted to

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,799
talk about so I wanted to do a part two

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,439
everybody like this is one of the the

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,180
episodes I think I've been hit up about

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,739
most for people wanting us to do a part

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,939
two like they're like you've got to do

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,859
them next week and we already had

33
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,199
something planned so we're diving back

34
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,500
into it I had a lot of people reach out

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,540
I I mean unexpectedly sort of you don't

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,579
have a lot of friends like people who I

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,259
talk to on Instagram and stuff but there

38
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,118
was like strangers that were reaching

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,159
out to me and they were like hey I

40
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,500
listened to your podcast a long time ago

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,540
and then you know this one and I want to

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,700
hear more like you know could you like

43
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,618
go more in detail on this more in detail

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,960
on that when are the [ __ ] seats being

45
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,759
released again because I am a stingy

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,938
bastard when it comes to releasing seeds

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,399
we all know this yes um yes [ __ ]

48
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,919
horrifying it's like no we're my

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,320
pleasure

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,180
close enough [ __ ] I work with them

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,559
for four years before I let anyone touch

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,780
them but it's so much better than

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280
flooding the market with just crap that

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,659
you that you're not proud of or that

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,500
you're not sure of you know what I mean

56

62
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,079
have been another episode in itself yeah

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,580
right now yeah and it would have just

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
kept flowing

we'll meet up this week and uh yeah so

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,939
uh I kind of want to do this release a

84
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,878
little different so there isn't going to

85
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,919
be like here's 15 varieties so yeah

86
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,560
we're the ones that I really really

87
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,859
really have loved so I mean I shouldn't

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
say that the the ones that the they're

89
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,700
all [ __ ] good I'm not even going to

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,620
mention that so the reason five these

91
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,359
are the five that are coming up yeah so

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,480
we're gonna start off with the London

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,480
pound cake 75 by the rainbow sister okay

94
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,340
the cool thing about it is is that the

95
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:39,500
London pound cake

96
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,299
terp show up but not it's weird

97
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,939
but not it's a weird structure of yeah

98
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,459
like if you don't nail that plant like

99
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,979
she will get poofy on you not Lara fee

100
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,439
per se but poofy like an old hash plant

101
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,199
not not as um not as dense as like a

102
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,719
cookies or OG exactly yeah like so now

103
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,459
you add that rainbow to it you get that

104
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,859
turret but you get the rainbow high

105
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,439
profile growth pattern structure all

106
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,140
that and then it's been yeah and it's

107
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,658
[ __ ] been repetitive it's been over

108
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,938
and over and over

109
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:14,158
um we have found a few that are gassy

110
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:16,978
like a gassy fruit is the only way I can

111
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,120
describe it like a aerosoly fruit that

112
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,839
gets in here

113
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,319
uh sensors but most of them are like the

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,239
a lemon OG or a berry OG or something

115
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,180
around that one did you just say get in

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,040
your sensors yeah [ __ ] right

117
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,199
there in the center like you're a robot

118
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,040
get it right up in here get up in there

119
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,379
with your sensors

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,939
so that's that's the [ __ ] first one

121
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,699
have you named it yet or has your

122
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,860
daughter named it yet she hasn't and um

123
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,040
I don't know you're gonna have to just

124
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,620
do a spinning Board of names of names

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,199
and uh well yeah that's something that

126
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,600
we should discuss because I am the worst

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,600
at naming plants my names have always

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,900
been this plant by this plant is what

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,879
this plant is called

130
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:07,918
and yeah I think we're getting back to

131
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,159
that like yeah people wanted everything

132
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,740
to be like [ __ ] cream puff pie with

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,960
cinnamon strudel and Twinkie dicks and

134
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,939
things like that but I think it tastes

135
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,519
like Twinkie dicks and it never smells

136
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,100
like cookie Dix yeah it never tastes

137
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,319
like a Twinkie tick knuckle taste like

138
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,520
Twinkie dicks I've tasted so many

139
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:32,519
Twinkie dicks and none of them

140
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:37,439
just so really [ __ ] Twinkies

141
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:39,000
so that one is really [ __ ] good I I

142
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:44,219
am not uh

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,620
uh a huge fan of uh some of these these

144
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,780
these plants uh they that are popular

145
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,160
like yeah I did some runts crosses and

146
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,319
stuff as well

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,020
I released it to a few friends because

148
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,740
they were very much wanting it yeah um

149
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:01,139
but for me it was I don't trust the the

150
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,019
rats plant as much as I did the London

151
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,660
pound cake 75. uh the London pound cake

152
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:09,240
75 has shown

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,320
it's it's a lot like Sunset Sherbert

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,240
yeah but it I really enjoyed the sunset

155
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,279
Sherbert I got years ago the first one

156
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,259
that I worked on I like sure whatever's

157
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,779
pretty good yeah it has that funk to it

158
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,199
so anyhow that was number one the second

159
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,959

164
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,780
plant and I was all cool so it sat for a

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,120
long time and then I grew it and it it's

166
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:48,538
[ __ ] good it's [ __ ] good what's it

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,459
like on its own so it is do you remember

168
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,860
uh

169
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,258
oh God what was the name of that [ __ ]

170
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,560
plant uh Jesus it's an old Europe Europe

171
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,439
guy uh it turned like this weird purple

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,459
on the inside I think Black Rose is made

173
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,600
from it

174
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,579
um

175
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,580
God damn it I still haven't Blackberry

176
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:11,399
or black rice I think it was even like

177
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,199
uh around those times so anyways uh I

178
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,299
think

179
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,360
I'll go grab the seeds Sani Sani seeds

180
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,300
made this plant okay okay

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,360
yeah it actually turns like this weird

182
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,360
lilacy purple

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,939
like right off the bat yeah and um it

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,259
will come to me uh in a minute on what

185
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,779
the name of the plant is because I still

186
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,479
have some of sami's original release of

187
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,579
the seeds in the freezer oh so anyways

188
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,639
Killing Fields there you go Killing

189
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:44,399
Fields yeah so this is uh old Jack Herer

190
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,079
hybrid yep so it will remind you of

191
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,179
Killing Fields right because of the

192
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,180
color and stuff but then it has this

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,340
like Berry flavory smell taste thing

194
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,139
going on to it from the blue Hawaiian

195
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,239
I'm assuming blue Hawaiian is a

196
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,280
blueberry hybrid is it yes it is I I

197
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,780
actually crossed the blue bonnet to a

198
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,339
blue Hawaiian this last round you've

199
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,019
probably got a lot of [ __ ] blueberry

200
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,519
though I actually saved you a pack of

201
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,500
the London pound cake cross the blue

202
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,939
bonnet too oh that will be [ __ ]

203
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,038
interesting yeah I didn't make many of

204
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,779
them like I just had a small clone you

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,639
know of it growing but yeah I saved you

206
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,019
something I think I brought you did I

207
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,199
bring you that cologne I did you did

208
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:22,139
everyone I brought you that I saved it

209
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,520
it's okay so and then the Romulan part

210
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,220
so

211
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,740
the Romulan part was weird because I

212
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,720
kept seeing more of the blue Hawaiian

213
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,519
show in color and stature and everything

214
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,219
and then with the rainbow you were

215
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,658
getting more of a rainbow look and the

216
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,060
rainbow thing it was almost like the

217
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,700
rainbow overpowered the blue Hawaiian

218
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,799
romula except for

219
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,278
coloring you will get these rainbow

220
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,979
plants with that Killing Fields looking

221
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,139
purple like that weird purple you crack

222
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,800
it open like you said the lilac color

223
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,778
Yes like a lilacy purple look to it and

224
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,458
um you want something that will like

225
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:02,338
remind you of

226
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,079
like a different time a different era

227
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,360
yeah that would be [ __ ] one because

228
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,220
yeah it's just a trip I don't when

229
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,620
people ask me like what is Rainbow

230
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,200
tastes like it's dirt profile the thing

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,299
that I get the most is it reminds me of

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,580
the first time I smoked good wheat yeah

233
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,979
like it reminds me of that time like

234
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,379
when you know Green bud or kind buds or

235
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,959
whatever it was it was it reminds me of

236
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,179
that time and no one can really like

237
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,338
give me like an explanation other than

238
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:32,759
it reminds me of that you get like that

239
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,519
Menthol minty like Joey you know that

240
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,319
soury dot I think so that Rainbow's

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,639
sister like I said that was Bryn's

242
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,019
favorite and that was one of my

243
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,580
favorites too but it was it was more

244
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,039
chocolatey version of that which is

245
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,860
super cool you know it has like a cocoa

246
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,659
stuff yeah they do and most of the [ __ ]

247
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,120
that you see that promises chocolate

248
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,338
doesn't provide chocolate now a lot of

249
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,440
the the stuff that people uh promise

250
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,180
chocolate with turns out like earthy and

251
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,399
it's not chocolate it's not it's the

252
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,879
milk chocolate it's just earthy and you

253
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,940
can vaguely hope for some chocolate over

254
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,740
there yeah yeah I used to have a Bubba

255
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,060
cross

256
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,980
um I don't even know what it was crossed

257
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,739
with once again gifted plants man you

258
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,899
remember at one time late 90s early

259
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,879
2000s when you started getting in with

260
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,839
these tight friends and stuff like that

261
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,338
and people would gift you things oh yeah

262
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,279
there was above a cross that I had that

263
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,279
was like espresso like straight up like

264
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,080
drinking a cup of [ __ ] espresso she

265
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,360
ain't yield for [ __ ] [ __ ] it was like

266
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,240
the world's smallest plant but the

267
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,919
flower like that coffee like literally

268
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,720
you open the bag and the house smelled

269
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,120
like [ __ ] a bag of coffee beans yeah

270
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,220
that one was cool we had a clock that's

271
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,320
one called smart Alex that was like that

272
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,639
that was uh you open it it just smelled

273
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,019
like opening a can of folders like

274
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,600
sticking their nose in it I mean exactly

275
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,419
just like how does this even exist you

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,139
know yeah how does this terpene exist in

277
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:59,219
cannabis yeah super weird yeah so that

278
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,980
was too

279
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,600
um the third one was rainbow sister we

280
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,839
talked about that one already the S1

281
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,360
version uh the San Diego OG which I have

282
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,459
went over in detail with people uh I

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,759
still got to get Matt uh cut and some

284
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,199
flowers of it so he did kind of idea to

285
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,980
see where

286
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,680
I think it's either related to or from

287
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,180
the same time and just one of the cuts

288
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,939
went one way and one of the cuts with

289
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,939
triangle uh yeah I think I think they're

290
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,300
all around that same area the same time

291
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,339
frame the same same thing

292
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,958
I personally growing a triangle plant in

293
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,640
the San Diego plant beside each other I

294
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,278
would I smoked in San Diego every time

295
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,519
it hasn't it does have us a different

296
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,100
profile like a small profile but that

297
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,500
could still be from like a drift you can

298
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,120
still get drift in your smells and your

299
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,159
growth patterns and stuff especially if

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,519
one plant was beat up for decades you

301
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,519
know yeah yeah so

302
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,919
um so there is a there could be that

303
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,500
drift or they could be seeds from the

304
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,360
same parents where they both came from

305
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,179
or something they're definitely [ __ ]

306
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,639
related 100 yeah structure everything

307
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,719
looks the same it's just a little that

308
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,419
San Diego has more of this uh

309
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,339
putrideness like that's always good

310
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:23,519

327
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,859
the great pie for me would by itself

328
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,419
it's interesting it's pretty I love it I

329
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,639
love it yeah it's beautiful it's super

330
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,559
[ __ ] easy to grow it is it makes

331
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,419
everyone look like a rock star when you

332
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,000
grow it I the funny thing about that cut

333
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,099
was it was from Canada I can't remember

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,019
I think it was Harry Harry Palms who

335
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,899
selected it it was like a one out of one

336
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,000
seed selection just one pop and it just

337
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,259
turned out phenomenal I think they were

338
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,559
saying something about that I think

339
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,958
three or four seeds yeah something

340
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,699
ridiculous yeah I remember we talked

341
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,619
with Canada at one of the shows and he

342
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,959
was talking about it and it was like

343
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,278
before it hit the this Market I think

344
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,500
yeah you're giving me the cut really

345
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,299
early on yeah he was showing me pictures

346
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,620
on this phone and I was going over some

347
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,659
of the pictures of the rainbow and he

348
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,339
was we were both just comparing some

349
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:50,039
notes that was one of the nicer dudes

350
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,019
yeah really really nice always always so

351
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,519
cool um yeah you know I think a lot of

352
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,899
people have a lot of impressions of them

353
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,519
because he released like me he released

354
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,078
a lot of femlines Femmes across the

355
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,940
fence and stuff so they just assumed

356
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,739
that that's all he does but like I have

357
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,600
loads of regular seeds and like of

358
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,399
course old lines that he's reproduced

359
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,200
and stuff so he does some cool stuff

360
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,179
just not a lot of people are privy to it

361
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,019
yeah and I think a lot of people too

362
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:15,419
like um see like when you do thin lines

363
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,700
and you do the reversing and stuff like

364
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:19,799
that I don't think if people seen what

365
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,200
our DMS look like yeah they would

366
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,838
understand why we released so many or

367
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,160
you so people I haven't really released

368
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,560
fins this is going to be one of my first

369
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,860
I've made them to like you know hold

370
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:34,018
down genetics yeah but my DMs are when

371
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,399
will you release release films when will

372
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,500
you make films and are you gonna do a

373
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,360
fimsy FMC there's so many people who

374
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,799
don't keep moms who don't make clothes

375
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,199
they don't keep moms they don't want to

376
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,419
wait inside Nails space space space

377
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,639
that's the one [ __ ] thing we get all

378
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,319
the time and I hear you I understand man

379
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,539
I get it you know

380
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,500
not all of us have 120 [ __ ] lights

381
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:57,778
yeah like I I have a lot of lights so

382
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,759
for me I have [ __ ] mom rooms that are

383
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:03,958
size of most of the people's flower

384
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,240
rooms so uh it's for me like I I kind of

385
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,819
forget that you know like uh yeah I

386
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,339
remember those days like in the early

387
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,500
90s or mid I should say early mid to

388
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,660
late 90s and I had this tiny little

389
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,820
[ __ ] closet in the bedroom you know

390
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,159
with uh yeah dude light I stoled off of

391
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,079
the [ __ ] uh street light you know

392
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,838
because it had about it well into the

393
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,299
2000s man still using old magnetic

394
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,100
ballasts and [ __ ] yeah no I had the

395
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:31,139
Tweakers steal the [ __ ] actual street

396
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,720
lights oh yeah yeah that's how my dad

397
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,579
used to run it yeah yep the metal allies

398
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,740
off the street lights and then I would

399
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:39,958
flower under those and then

400
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,079
um I got my first magnetic ballasts and

401
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,119
I remember they were like just pieces of

402
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,359
[ __ ] but they didn't ever stop running

403
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,519
no that was part of the pro I still have

404
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,680
some of them they're like 30 [ __ ]

405
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,899
years old and you could still plug them

406
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,239
in the problem is though they never stop

407
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,458
running so even if they get sprayed with

408
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,399
water they never stop running if your

409
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,778
room floods they never no other stuff

410
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,778
right they sure don't yeah you're gonna

411
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:08,939
let you get [ __ ] out of yourself so that

412
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,399
was the the five

413
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,920
um that we were talking about yeah uh I

414
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,620
think that was the five uh I was I was

415
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,740
considering doing the wedding cake uh

416
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,940
rainbow uh assist or the GMO rainbow

417
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,680
cyst

418
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:27,839
um the GMO Rainbow Six I don't think uh

419
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,599
I don't know if people will will grow it

420
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,360
to its ultimate potential yeah you want

421
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,399
to take her 75 80 days and a lot of

422
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,919
people aren't wanting to do that yeah um

423
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,320
so if I release it and people are like

424
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,860
hey look you know because it throws like

425
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,920
poo butt bro dude what's crazy is she

426
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,199
looked at 63. yeah she'll look down at

427
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:53,458
63 but then she'll hit a second growth

428
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:57,299
yeah 67 and then by 78 she is just the

429
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:59,039
nastiest garlic Bo thingy uh so they

430
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,439
will eventually get released but it will

431
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,958

00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,880
gelatos and sherbets and everything so I

649
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,480
was looking at them

650
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,700
and these clones were like an inch and a

651
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,980
half tall tops like they were like these

652
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,778
tiny tiny clones uh they didn't have

653
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,700
Roots most of them like you'd pull them

654
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,140
out and look it was like it was

655
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,819
literally like they had been trying to

656
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,400
root for three days

657
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:11,899
um that's enough yep I did find a few

658
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,120
with roots that I ended up uh uh

659
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,159
procuring to the to the facilities

660
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,879
um but it was a scary situation because

661
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,100
these plants were covered in piano yeah

662
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,000
covered in spider mites and when I mean

663
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:30,058
[ __ ] covered I mean like literally

664
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,700
I I've never seen like baby baby clothes

665
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:34,500
with PM because if you have pm on the

666
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,259
mom plant you're taking a clone you just

667
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,200
[ __ ] dip it yeah

668
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:42,658
yeah and so to see like these tiny

669
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,298
infantile cuts that means they literally

670
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:47,460
were taking them off of PM covered moms

671
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:49,139
not Karen she's [ __ ] plugging and

672
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,700
going and then delivering them to

673
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,799
somebody else to let it be their problem

674
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,778
just grow it out for us and we're gonna

675
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,798
put it in the bag anyways you know you

676
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:58,679
know what I think they're probably doing

677
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:01,980
is is some of their moms are probably in

678
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,500
a in a in a have pm on them but dormant

679
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,298
like they think it's gone but once they

680
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,700
stick it in those domes it's like it's

681
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:11,220
done yeah they're probably right in that

682
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,100
little Sports just pops yeah they start

683
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,460

some of the stuff I make is here in

720
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,939
California in [ __ ] weather people I

721
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,860
don't think people know what our

722
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,538
weather's like here sometimes no I think

723
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:57,479
they think it's all just like rainy per

724
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:59,940
or not rainy sunny perfect like yeah we

725
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,819
had 116 I slaughtered the pigs this year

726
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,740
when it was 116. yeah it was bad this

727
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,200
year yeah

728
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,359
growing season also the outdoor around

729
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,480
this part with there not being rain

730
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,639
anymore is so nasty yeah it's just

731
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,440
covered in

732
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,380
dirt dust debris uh fear has been so

733
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,679
many pesticides shot in our area since

734
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,360
the 30s and 40s for all the things

735
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,220
because we're like the agricultural

736
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,158
[ __ ] Capital

737
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,220
um that dust isn't just normal dust it's

738
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,500
like it's death dust yeah it's bad and

739
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,579
valley fever dust man yeah for real yeah

740
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,278
so

741
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:43,199
but yeah I went up there and uh I just

742
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,700
happened to be there the day the guys

743
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,319
were nice enough and everything like

744
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,120
that you could tell they were all like

745
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:54,839
oh you're gonna steal our plants I was

746
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:57,599
like maybe never never got them no yeah

747
00:29:54,839 --> 00:30:00,240
so I that was what was funny too man

748
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,278
like that was before the whole wrench

749
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,679
your life up thing was a thing like oh

750
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:07,679
yeah typing it yeah yeah they hadn't

751
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,200
started hyping it yet and uh

752
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,700
one of them was nice one of them turned

753
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,798
nice and black but it looked just like

754
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,740
gelato like it was literally spinning

755
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:19,558
image that's runs that's the runs clone

756
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,960
it's just gelato 33. yeah and then there

757
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,000
was the white ruts and the pink runts

758
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,500
and the white rinse was all right

759
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,599
um they tried to say it was the white

760
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,179
with the rats crossed together or

761
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,778
something like that seriously yeah and

762
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,519
then yeah that was me yeah I don't think

763
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:38,579
you guys spread anything with the white

764
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,500
yeah I think it was just another bag

765
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,359
seed that you found that look decent you

766
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,119
know what's a cool white strain oh let's

767
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,038
see the white yeah and then yeah there

768
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,798
was the pink Reds but at that time they

769
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,319
had multiple [ __ ] rights yeah trains

770
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,879
like they did now I don't know if they

771
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,460
still do

772
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,500
um but they had the all their gelato's

773
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,019

784
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,799
people had started to go like oh man I

785

789
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:36,778

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,278
but

811
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:32,579
it the plant was really pretty like it

812
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,460
was really pretty but so is gelato and

813
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:36,658
so is Sherbert like yeah

814
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,340
I'd love for some of their names to

815
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,520
match up with what's going on you know

816
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,740
what it is yeah it would honestly yeah

817
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,619
there's no way it has campus I just

818
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,480
don't believe it it looks just like

819
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:50,339
every other [ __ ] cookie plant I've

820
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,319
seen like the exact same structure

821
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:54,418
everything like that you know the long

822
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,278
Spears the chunky little buds you know I

823
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,620
genuinely think that they just take

824
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:02,898
gelato bag seeds just they do of the

825
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,898
Herms and just like they're like

826
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,740
I've never met the woman or anything but

827
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,839
I'm gonna name it after okay that's

828
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,058
exactly what the [ __ ] it is that's

829
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:18,000
exactly what it is you know it is like

830
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,740
because everything all their stuff has

831
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,599
little arms on them all of them have

832
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,099
little bag seats on them you find them

833
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,898
you grow them some of them are home runs

834
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:26,158
some of them are not do you find the new

835
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:28,018
home run you're all hey it looks like

836
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,120
gelato but it has a slight variation

837
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:33,000
let's just say that we crossed it with

838
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:35,339
something yeah I mean remember run just

839
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,720
means making it successful on IG that's

840
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,699
literally what the meaning of a home run

841
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,159
is anymore that's all it is that's all

842
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,500
it is I there's so many smoke in it

843
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,740
doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's

844
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,599
what gets hyped up on social media uh

845
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,339
what people talk about on social media

846
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,278
and

847
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:56,699
that's it like yep I couldn't imagine

848
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:59,720
now they have uh

849
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,759
oh they have some other cookies and milk

850
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,038
[ __ ] stuff and they have so much

851
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,679
stuff but it's all it looks all the same

852
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,300
but I got to see like their Mothership

853
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,579
if you will what comes from the

854
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,500
mothership and it's it was rough man

855
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:15,898
like I feel bad for the people who

856
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,898
actually go and pay that money to buy

857
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:22,079
that stuff uh because

858
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:22,799
there's no way those plants are clean

859
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,398
um

860
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,740
like without using something before it

861
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,659
gets to you yeah and you're not testing

862
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,039
the dirty plants they're not testing

863
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,220
that they're they're testing clean

864
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:37,440
plants and then saying that they have

865
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,898
lots of pounds of those clean plants but

866
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,980
in reality they're just sliding in

867
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:43,618
because

868
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,039
they're not testing every bag that's

869
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,079
brought to no to to every single day on

870
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,179
the market no they're not testing it

871
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,219
they're you're bringing in an eighth or

872
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,960
a few grams having it tested and then

873
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,039
telling the state I have 200 pounds of

874
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,380
this yeah

875
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,659
states are okay we want taxes on it and

876
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,460
you're all like yeah 180 of those pants

877
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:03,899
came from a greenhouse but no one knows

878
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,720
that it's all going into these fancy

879
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,940
jars and bags anyway so and people like

880
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,739
I if you remember when cookies first

881
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,720
started getting real big

882
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:14,639
and they started getting the mylar bags

883
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,799
do you remember people on IG like

884
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,659
opening up those mylar bags on video and

885
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,000
like just showing all the mold and

886
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:23,039
people going to cookie stores and in the

887
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,300
store window you'd see their little

888
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,739
clones that they put out there as

889
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,200
display and they would just be filled

890
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:30,598
with bugs and [ __ ] VM and just in the

891
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,460
store window like the clue that they

892
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,420
were displaying this bad [ __ ] because

893
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:39,599
they were just so inexperienced two two

894
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,940
things that that reminds me of not to

895
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,599
talk bad about anybody but uh High times

896
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:49,260
did a article on swerve oh yeah yes yes

897
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,019
they went into his Grow rooms on THC

898
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,300
former too they were covered in [ __ ]

899
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:56,519
spider bites yeah and they were taking

900
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,320
these close-ups where they were all like

901
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,739
smelling the buds and stuff and I saw

902
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,700
how the [ __ ] is this a center fault yeah

903
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,699
High Times

904
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:12,599
no none of them but it was like it's it

905
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,759
wasn't something that you like catch as

906
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,920
a mistake God damn you could see it

907
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,420
every [ __ ] where they were big top

908
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,639
tents in there you know they weren't

909
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,820
even that like I remember the pictures

910
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,159
not even being that like detailed and

911
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:29,160
you could still see the PM inside your

912
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:33,239
mind yeah it was bad it was a different

913
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,920
time a different era a bygone era but we

914
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,239
always do what spider mites look like on

915
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,940
leaves if you were a grower especially

916
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,759
from California that was the dude

917
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,800
spider bites and uh caterpillar damage

918
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,320
like yeah for outdoor Growers exactly

919
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,240
you know what to do you know what you're

920
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,579
going to be dealing with but I remember

921
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,939
that article in looking at those plants

922
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:56,640
and I was all this is like this is real

923
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,179
life like this is like who works there

924
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,639
have you guys ever seen cannabis like

925
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,618
does this look normal to you and then um

926
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,440
so there was that one

927
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,780
I got we were just I had another one

928
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,980
that was the second one that I wanted to

929
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,800
bring up and now I can't remember what

930
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,838
oh the um when they were asking Berner

931
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,500
beginning what was cookies and he was

932
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:22,259
all oh it's F1 like F1

933
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:24,119
horrible yeah and that should have told

934
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,820
people right then that it was just some

935
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,400
sort of bag seed stuff that they had got

936
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,980
from the bay at the time yeah

937
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,660
there was so much purple weed in the bay

938
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,699
at the time whether it was granddaddy or

939
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:41,879
Urkel or yeah uh the SR-71 and I've seen

940
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:43,919
so many mutants in uh Urkel Crossing and

941
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,920
deep Urkel lines where it looks like

942
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,960
ogkb and ogkb looks like Urkel because

943
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,320
they both have the slow trait they can

944
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,240
get the weird Leaf patterns and then so

945
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,579
I could imagine there's a Herm with

946
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:59,159
maybe there was a Herm with an OG or a

947
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,660
Herm with an Urkel and they got a bag of

948
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,838
Urkel and they're all like hey let's

949
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:05,639
start growing and the OG Herms in a grow

950
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,279
room and threw some pollen on an Urkle

951
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,259
and now you have this plant that looks

952
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,300
could be cookies I don't this story

953
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,460
could be different but I could imagine

954
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,500
that these were the things and they

955
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,019
found the you know a couple of pounds or

956
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,519
ounces or whatever that had a few seeds

957
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:24,000
in them and they decided to become

958
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:26,719
Growers and that's their F1 their F1 was

959
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,338
the first generation bag seeds

960
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,338
they weren't sure if F1 was across

961
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:46,140
that's such a weird plant to pick yeah

962
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:50,299
the dirt like it was an odd plant to

963
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:53,098
pick because I've never ever seen

964
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,320
anything come out of any cookie cross

965
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,480
that resembles their at all ever not

966
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,579
history I don't think they knew like I

967
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,199
think they pulled a name out of the sky

968
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,220
that's what it was popular strain and

969
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,559
like they didn't know they were

970
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:08,399
attaching like a South African sativa

971
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:13,078

1020
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:15,179
cherry pie this plant was just called

1021
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,039
[ __ ] cherry pie like that's what it

1022
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,319
was called and it wasn't it was a nice

1023
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,019
bun it really was it had like a menthol

1024
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,240
thing going on with like a a berry thing

1025

1026
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:30,299
to it uh but that's it so the Cherry Pie

1027
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,619
was around dark heart had it and then um

1028
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,280
dark heart never and then they had

1029
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,559
another one they called three kings

1030
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,500
yeah yeah it was that was it was it was

1031
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,659
I think it was like a Sour OG Bubba or

1032
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,000
something like that yeah another one

1033
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:48,920
that they tried to say ended up coming

1034
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,440
from later known as the cookie family so

1035
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:56,039
Cherry Pie and the three kings were

1036
00:41:52,440 --> 00:42:00,420
supposedly those guys as like first

1037
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:02,400
rendezvous with the clothing yeah uh but

1038
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,380
that was before they were you know this

1039
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,820
and that and the other I guess they were

1040
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,960
well known in the bay at the time

1041
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,880
already

1042
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,099
um because the rap scene and things like

1043
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,220
that and uh but they weren't well known

1044
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,800
in the cannabisy yeah so and I had both

1045
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:20,819
of those the three kings was

1046
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,220
right uh I would still grow cherry pie I

1047
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,619

get like a few thousand clones that was

1088
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,980

um but it was really hard to get [ __ ]

1109
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,000
clones there and plus they'd only let

1110

got offered some stuff from dark heart

1178
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,619
because they were looking for breeders

at the time yeah and for house projects

1180

monopoly on clones like legit and there

1195
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,900
was little guys who were still trying to

1196
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,699
compete and they were doing fine but

1197
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,039
they had to find specific things that

1198
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:28,019
dark art didn't monopolize yeah star

1199

quit in the past five six years so

1216
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:15,059
let's get to this point uh stardog dark

1217
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,800
heart had a cut of stardog a friend of

1218
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:19,679
mine went and bought a thousand star dog

1219
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,560

1220
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,179
a thousand it was 500 per grow and he

1221
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,818
calls me about

1222
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:28,500
day 40 or so you saw hey can you come

1223
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:30,599
and look at my plants use all some

1224
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,000
things wrong so

1225
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:35,160
I go over and I look and it would be

1226
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,719
like pretty plant

1227
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:39,299
plant that looks like pretty plant

1228
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:42,000
without resin without structure like

1229
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,339
without density just puffballs pretty

1230
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,679
plant puffball no resin pretty plant

1231
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:48,358
puffball no resin puffball no resin

1232
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,098
plants also started throwing out little

1233
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:52,380
banana herbs like just little little

1234
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:54,900
pollen bags the the other ones didn't

1235
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,240
now you could tell that they were the

1236
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,039
same plant it wasn't mislabeled these

1237
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,858
were the same plant but they weren't off

1238
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,139
of the same mop clearly the healthy

1239
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:05,699
plants probably came from one mom and

1240
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,259
puffball plants came from another month

1241
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:10,500
so you know what I've been learning from

1242
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:13,020
the the hpld whatever the [ __ ] is called

1243
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,500
um is that some moms like you can take

1244
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:19,259
clones from the top part and it won't be

1245
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,780
as like it won't have as high of a

1246
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,099
viroid count yep and then you take it

1247
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,720
from the bottom so you can take it from

1248
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:26,579
the same exact plants and have different

1249
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,259
virus load yeah yeah you can have

1250
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,960
different viral loads and we actually

1251
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:33,000
seen that with a thousand plants we

1252
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,039
actually could see this now mind you

1253
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,039
this was way before this was a

1254
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,519
you had full Duds half Duds yeah that

1255
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,740
plant looks pretty [ __ ] good and yeah

1256
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,800
that's kind of dotted little dudded yeah

1257
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:54,179
how is that and you start thinking like

1258
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,980
okay this

1259
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,480
these plants are all getting the same

1260
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,940
thing these plants would be on the same

1261
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,579
[ __ ] table literally the same table

1262
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,639

1263
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:08,220

[ __ ] that wrong dude for real and but

1300
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:39,059
the shallow thinking process of these

00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:41,579
companies you're like okay so blue dream

1302

1335
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:08,818
was always so freaking cool I still have

1336
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:10,858
some of his seeds that were like

1337
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:13,460
unlabeled projects with like remember

1338
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:17,460
when Uzbekistan came out that yeah yeah

1339
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:19,380
uh the priests of uh or whatever yeah

1340
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,858
because when the Soviets came in the

1341
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:25,500
weed went bad somehow so he was working

1342
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:27,960
with a few things and he sent me some

1343
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,639
stuff you know and uh the free Soviet

1344
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,619
height thing whatever I don't know what

1345
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:33,960
that plant is but he must have liked it

1346
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:35,460
to breathe with it it's like nine

1347
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,579
different plants called pre-soviet

1348
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,679
afghanis yeah yeah so anyways he sent me

1349
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:43,260
a bunch of stuff he sent me some uh he

1350
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,759
called it like Cherry feel or cherry gas

1351
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:48,180
or something because he knew I was a

1352
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:51,300
cherry fan a few other things um

1353
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:52,679
so uh but that's what was going on a lot

1354
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,900
of those plants got watered down because

1355
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:57,179
of people getting bag seeds and growing

1356
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,460
it and saying it's glue four or it's uh

1357
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:01,799
specifically with blue dream I I

1358
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,599
remember when when it blew up there was

1359
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,760
a company called Emerald Triangle seeds

1360
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,200
which I remember in the Emerald Triangle

1361
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,460
people didn't like them because they

1362
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,858
weren't they weren't from the emerald

1363
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,960
trying yeah it was like a Spanish

1364
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:15,358
company it was mass producing a

1365
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,400
blueberry Haze in seed form yeah and

1366
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,799
then uh Humboldt seed organization I

1367
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,780
believe sold the same exact seeds I

1368
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,420
don't want to don't quote me they at

1369
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,400
least sold a blue dream that was not the

1370
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,019
same Blue Dream their own creation if

1371
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,818
not the same exact seeds the Emerald

1372
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:32,159
Triangle were settling under their label

1373
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:35,279
the Humboldt seed org when they first

1374
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,799
came in too I had so many friends

1375
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,160
telling me that they were

1376
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,260
bad for a lack of other words they

1377
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,879
weren't from the this place they didn't

1378
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,619
have these that was that's Emerald

1379
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,539
Triangle seeds that was Emerald Triangle

1380
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,519
okay okay okay okay I got those two

1381
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:52,380
mixed up then yeah I used to do all the

1382
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:54,300
time because they got both really dream

1383
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,980
yeah they both had the blue drink that's

1384
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,539
who it was then Emerald Triangle and I

1385
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,039
had friends who were just like this is

1386
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:01,980
horseshit and they're spreading

1387
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:05,099
horseshit so back to dark heart dark

1388
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:08,219
heart spread hplv

1389
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:11,460
I don't know how to really explain

1390
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:14,279
the epicenter that they cost it would be

1391
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,380
like very hard to say you know in a

1392
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,980
viral situation let's just like kind of

1393
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,720
take covid for example right so uh why

1394
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,240
are we allowed to say that word I don't

1395
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:26,459
know well there's yeah I'm not going to

1396
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,739
use the 19 part so I'll just use the

1397
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,338
co-fit name let's say a virus let's say

1398
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:35,098
a new virus

1399
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:36,900
hits humans and there's an epicenter of

1400
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:39,000
that right and there's

1401
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,800
a thousand people who live there

1402
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,338
those all those thousands of people move

1403
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,318
to a new state yep just and that's kind

1404
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:49,500
of what Dark Art did because when they

1405
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:52,259
did this it was at the like this new

1406
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,900
peak of the internet the new peak of

1407
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,880
Clone Cherry the new peak of all these

1408
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,400
seeds

1409
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,079
of of Clone internet sales too close

1410
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,940
Internet it's not going to dark heart

1411
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:06,119
picking up a tray of clones taking them

1412
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:08,760
on their their Instagram page their

1413
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:11,280
money yeah sometimes at least all over

1414
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,660
the country yeah they dude I know of

1415
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,420
people who have sent them to other

1416
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,940
countries oh yeah so and the same

1417
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:21,480
[ __ ] Cuts so

1418
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:24,179
that virus shouldn't have spread at the

1419
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:27,980
speed it spread

1420
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:30,659
through our industry without assistance

1421
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,059
the best part was that after everybody

1422
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,098
figured out oh [ __ ]

1423
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:37,140
Dark Art might have been the epicenter

1424
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:40,740
for this stuff then they're like huh we

1425
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:42,900
got a solution yeah we will sell you a

1426
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:44,279
cure for these a cure for this but they

1427
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,079
never said that they were the reason for

1428
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,819
the season you know that all this is

1429
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,039
happening but they did say we will sell

1430
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:52,139
you a cure and it is the real cure for

1431
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,599
hbob and guess what it didn't work it

1432
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:57,659
didn't work didn't work also darkheart's

1433
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,760
clones dried up at uh these shops in

1434
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:01,139
Harborside for a few months they were

1435
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,940
gone like you couldn't find dark heart

1436
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:05,039
cuts and other that's when like purple

1437
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,720
City genetics sort of kind of like blew

1438
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,940
up because they were able to like fill

1439
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,039
shelves

1440
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:13,260
yeah and uh all of a sudden dark cart

1441
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,960
comes back and what they did they knew

1442
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,819
they had sickness so they just uh they

1443
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,159
took the uh God I was just talking to

1444
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:21,239
you about it like before we came on so

1445
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:22,858
they uh

1446
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:24,899
and now I'm drawing the blank on what

1447
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:26,699
the tissue culture so they tissue

1448
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,700
cultured everything rebrother along

1449
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:32,159
built it back up I'm assuming that they

1450
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:33,719
were probably buying clones and selling

1451
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,879
clones so they could keep their business

1452
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,558
going I'm sure you know what I'm saying

1453
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,480
yeah a lot of people do that yeah yeah

1454
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,798
or they were shutting down one facility

1455
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,559
to clean it while they were still

1456
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,059
selling nasties over here and then this

1457
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:47,519
this facility was back up and running

1458
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,720
with new clean cuts from the tissue

1459
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,519
culture and then they shut down the

1460
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,199
evidence the thing we know about tissue

1461
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,420
culture it's so hit or miss on whether

1462
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:56,578
it's this you know get that like even if

1463
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,500
they do Mary stem culture they try to

1464
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,480
not get any of that I forgot what they

1465
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,760
call it it has to do with their um their

1466
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,920
vascular tissue but to make sure none of

1467
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,839
that gets along goes along with the Mary

1468
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,059
stem is really hard and really

1469
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,460
unpredictable yep until it's grown out

1470
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:14,700
is this you don't know until you grow it

1471
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:16,199
out yeah and you don't I have a friend

1472
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:17,879
um on Instagram and that's what he's

1473
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:20,219
doing right now he does a ton of tissue

1474
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,460
culture and uh

1475
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:25,318
super smart kid super [ __ ] God man

1476
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,298
some of you guys are really [ __ ]

1477
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,279
smart some of us older dudes our brains

1478
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:31,559
aren't like yeah we're slow dude we're

1479
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,380
[ __ ] drugs dude we're so much [ __ ]

1480
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:39,119
slower than you guys so that's why I've

1481
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:42,720
attended so much LSD is so many drugs so

1482
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,760
and if so like sometimes I'll stumble on

1483
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,919
my words and it's not because I don't

1484
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,099
know what I'm like trying to say it's

1485
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,680
because my brain and my mouth they're

1486
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:54,359
not like communicating properly he did

1487
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:55,558
have a part of his colon removed if you

1488
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,880
remember I did that was that was

1489
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,700
actually between the brain and the mouth

1490
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,858
yeah and I've had seizures yeah seizures

1491
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:04,019
really helps my brain yeah the seizures

1492
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:05,519
really [ __ ] that that pathway what's my

1493
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:07,079
excuse I haven't had a seizure yet but

1494
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,358
I'm sure brain damage drugs yeah just

1495
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:13,318
just drugs so I did those too but with

1496
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:15,838
also the other good stuff so yeah so he

1497
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:18,900
was still he was telling me about his

1498
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:21,179
tissue culturing and that some of them

1499
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,639
they can they can get and

1500
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:26,098
it they're clean the plants are come out

1501
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:29,639
clean so he was really excited and then

1502
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:32,460
later on they found traces of the virus

1503
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:35,098
in the plant and it's like how do how do

1504
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:37,318
we go about this will that virus load

1505
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,960
stay as a trace or is that virus load

1506
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:42,480
going to grow as the as the plant is

1507
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,880
that grows and I think I think they said

1508
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,500
it takes like two years of testing and

1509
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,539
constant testing to make sure it isn't

1510
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:52,019
showing up in the in the never stem

1511
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:53,880
culture yep and that was what was so

1512
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:56,940
scary is like he was telling me it's

1513
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,579
like once you get it it's like you have

1514
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,460
it oh yeah it's like herpes yeah like

1515
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:04,200
you always now your herpes can be like

1516
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,940
unnoticeable or you can be one of the

1517
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,939
ones that have like the uh

1518
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:22,440
but

1519
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,920
um that's what's fun man about that

1520
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,838
Twinkie dick but like knowing people and

1521
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,119
like actually putting myself out there

1522
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,279
more is like meeting more people like

1523
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,200
intelligent people that have shared

1524
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,180
knowledge and they share I'm good at

1525
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,919
certain things they're good at certain

1526
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:41,399
things and they can you know we can kind

1527
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:46,619
of communicate and stuff and uh

1528
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:50,940
I do I do think that there is uh a cure

1529
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:52,619
for it I I I hope we find find it we've

1530
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:56,159
all been working on certain things yeah

1531
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:59,220
certain things are showing uh promise oh

1532
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:02,578
God I hope it works it's right now we

1533
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:05,459
have a plant that had it and now when we

1534
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:07,318
had to test it it doesn't so we'll see

1535
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,818
it's like you said it's going to be a

1536
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:10,798
couple of years before I actually get to

1537
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:13,739
talk about it really but we'll see yeah

1538
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:16,858
it'll break my heart after it's been a

1539
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:19,078
year-ish and it pops back up and yeah

1540
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:21,058
it's possible though it's going yeah and

1541
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,400
it will absolutely just

1542
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:25,319
be a [ __ ] gut punch but we'll see

1543
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,798
where it's at and it was with a spray

1544
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:31,318
that was right important part like we

1545
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:33,358
sprayed the plants it wasn't like

1546
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:35,099
it's things that you can do at home yeah

1547
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,380
you don't have to inject it into a

1548
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:39,359
specific yeah into phloem or xylem or

1549
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,940
any of that stuff it was a spray yeah we

1550
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,639
put it into the roots and we put it onto

1551
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:49,139
the the entire plant and uh

1552
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:51,539
it tested clean and I was the the first

1553
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:53,879
thing was is seeing the plant grew resin

1554
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:55,500
yeah and that was like holy [ __ ] like

1555
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,380
that's something that was the first step

1556
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,639
right yeah yes and then the plant looked

1557
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,200
like what it was supposed to look like

1558
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,539
and then the flowers look like what it's

1559
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:07,279
supposed to look like everything was

1560
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:10,318
um now I didn't smoke the flowers

1561
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,380
I didn't smoke the flowers

1562
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:15,358
um but I don't humans ingest this that I

1563
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,280
think that we use so I mean people

1564
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,460
actually take it

1565
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:23,099
uh either but but combustibility I don't

1566
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,720
know like yeah you know we can eat

1567
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,220
things but if you smoke it it's probably

1568
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,739
not going to be super healthy for you

1569
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,659
yeah yeah a lot of a lot of um cancer

1570
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:32,818
stuff just comes from the combustion of

1571
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:34,858
certain things and whatnot yeah yeah so

1572
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:37,019
that's where we're at with that but I

1573
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:39,239
think that's exciting it's exciting it

1574
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:43,318
it is it's pretty cool

1575
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:45,779
um so yeah oh God so we went with the

1576
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:49,380
cookie stuff so yeah don't buy their

1577
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:52,619
flowers because the Lord just get away

1578
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:56,579
from that we don't need that anymore the

1579
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:59,160
the gelato times gelato inbred cookies

1580
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:01,798
we're losing so much bottleneck because

1581
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:03,179
of it bottlenecking it's I don't even

1582
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:05,119
really want to call it like

1583
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:07,440
bottlenecking

1584
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,260
it's like braiding and intentionally

1585
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,960
unusually but yeah this is just idiots

1586
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,180
it's like Washington apples man when we

1587
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,400
were kids I this is always my analogy

1588
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:19,019
for what's going on in cannabis When We

1589
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,000
Were Young Washington apples were

1590
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:22,798
[ __ ] delicious they were kind of ugly

1591
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,960
they were off a little bit and like

1592
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,940
oblong with knots and stuff but they

1593
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,159
were crispy they were juicy they were

1594
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,838
all oh my God tastes like apple now you

1595
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:33,539
go get a red delicious apple and it

1596
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:37,159
tastes like wet foam yeah and it was

1597
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:40,460
because they bred for looks on the table

1598
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:42,480
more than they bred for flavor foreign

1599
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,519
packaging and transport and all that

1600
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,500
yeah yep so have you seen have you seen

1601
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:48,480
the square watermelons the Chinese bread

1602
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,760
for packing and shipping they just have

1603
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,960
no flavor at all but they're squares so

1604
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,059
you can ship them easier and they pack

1605
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,679
into boxes easier who cares if they

1606
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:58,400
don't taste good I mean they're Square

1607
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,399
yeah

1608
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:05,339
god dude so and that's my concern like

1609
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:08,460
with the Cannabis is like every breeder

1610
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:10,500
it's not like okay you bred something

1611
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:13,440
with gelato or you've read something

1612
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,960
with it no no you're taking ruts you're

1613
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,460
taking gelato you're taking sherbet and

1614
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,119
you're reversing it

1615
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,338
to more runts and gelato and Sherbert

1616
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:26,400
and then somebody else is finding clones

1617
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:30,000
from those and they're reversing it to

1618
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,160
more runts and gelato and Sherbert so

1619
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,019
purple punch really did a [ __ ] number

1620
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,879
on the scene

1621
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:38,699
um there's so many people who bred with

1622
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,700
punch and so many plants look like punch

1623
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:43,379
and taste like it and and I'm not [ __ ]

1624
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:46,139
talking purple punch I'll smoke it

1625
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,940
doesn't it's I don't mind the flavors I

1626
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:50,338
don't need to get blown the [ __ ] out and

1627
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,079
that plant does me fine some people need

1628
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:53,099
higher strength than I do that one does

1629
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,220
me fine

1630
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:58,980
um and then but basically what we're

1631
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:02,399
getting down to is gelato purple punch

1632
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:04,380
yeah I mean to be honest I rarely even

1633
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,960
see punch stuff anymore like you don't

1634
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:09,000
that was such a small wave and it seemed

1635
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,740
like for two years everybody hit

1636
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,619
everything to punch and then now it's

1637
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:15,598
just back to gelato or cooking

1638
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:17,640
I shouldn't say gelato it's back to

1639
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,539
cookies with different names different

1640
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:21,719
names

1641
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:23,639
cookies whether it's sure gelato [ __ ]

1642
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,379
yeah whatever you're doing all the [ __ ]

1643
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:27,779
the same thing with the cookies to me

1644
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:29,220
like it's all the same base genetics and

1645
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,319
all has a similar look they're different

1646
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:33,239
expressions of the same exact genetics

1647
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:34,619
and and the more people breed them back

1648
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,479
to each other even if it's they're not

1649
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:39,298
intentionally breeding trying to inbreed

1650
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,920
for for like uniformity yeah that's

1651
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:42,900
what's gonna happen that's what happened

1652
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,519
I had a lot of recesses are gonna happen

1653
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,039
too so

1654
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:48,900
I wasn't necessarily looking for no

1655
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,000
they're not and it's like do you

1656
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:53,039
remember uh when cookies first came

1657
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,960
right and it was that little rabbit turd

1658
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,180
looking plant it was like this little

1659
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,099
little black plant with like these

1660
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:01,139
little tiny buns and

1661
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:03,420
I remember somebody sent me that cut I

1662
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:05,400
was super curious about it because he

1663
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,838
was weird yeah it looked [ __ ] weird

1664
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,639
and I was always about The Oddities

1665
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,578
that's why I like Duck foot and [ __ ] was

1666
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,980
my thing you know and uh I got it I grew

1667
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:15,480
it and it was like oh yeah that's that

1668
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,280
was pretty cool it's an interesting

1669
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,579
point I could never really grow it

1670
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,460
though because it's so light like it's

1671
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:26,220
not it wasn't good enough quality to

1672
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:28,380
like Mass produce it to get like top

1673
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:29,578
tier money in my head that's what I was

1674
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,019
thinking

1675
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,420
um but then when I put it on the market

1676
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:35,159
and then I told people oh no it was Girl

1677
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:37,200
Scout cookies and at the time that's

1678
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:38,639
when it first started to go and people

1679
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,618
started telling me stories about oh my

1680
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,420
God it's not like eating a Girl Scout

1681
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:44,099
cookie but it's like the Box you know

1682
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,700
like after the cookies are gone you

1683
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:49,260
smell the box and I'm like cardboard

1684
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:51,058
it smells like [ __ ] cardboard like

1685
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:53,119
yeah are you telling me my weed smells

1686
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:53,119
like

1687
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:57,959
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you and then

1688
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,639
then there was this new one the second

1689
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,858
one the animal

1690
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,538
um of the Forum yeah with the Forum cut

1691
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:04,739
and that one had like a little more

1692
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:08,460
chunk to it

1693
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:09,959
yeah and um uh then the animal cookies I

1694
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,019
remember when animal cookies came out

1695
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:17,279

1699
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,140
but I didn't see anything about it till

1700
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:27,119
2010 and the animal cookies and these

1701
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:29,520
two dudes went and did a YouTube review

1702
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,679
on it and they were like it tastes just

1703
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,719
like animal crackers bro do you smell

1704

it's that whole uh

1712
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,140
thinking something and you find what

1713
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:53,579
you're looking for you know

1714
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,679
um and then that one too the animal

1715
01:08:53,579 --> 01:09:00,679
cookies there were the stories about

1716
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:03,359
like oh it was this OG with girls yeah

1717
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:04,920
this one and this one and people started

1718
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,520
trying to take credit that they were

1719
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:11,219
like oh yeah I created that yeah

1720
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:13,980
and and back then it was really easy to

1721
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:16,259
pass [ __ ] off yeah because everybody was

1722
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:18,479
new to the inter like these not the

1723
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:20,039
internet but these websites yeah so like

1724
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,198
all these cannabis websites you started

1725
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:24,000
popping up popping that popping up like

1726
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:25,318
tons of them and you could just go in

1727
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,298
there and have a picture of something

1728
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:30,298
you grew and say oh I created this yeah

1729
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:32,100
I remember when cookies came out

1730
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:34,738
um I was the first one to put it out in

1731
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,679
seed form and shortly thereafter swerve

1732
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:39,059
started selling cook cookies and people

1733
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,100
were punking him because it was you were

1734
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,798
just like relabeling sfe or some other

1735
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:46,859
OG hybrid as cookies and selling it and

1736
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:48,298
then um BC Bud Depot also did same thing

1737
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:50,160
and people are growing up there [ __ ] it

1738
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:54,539
was just awful it wasn't even related to

1739
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:58,500
OG it was just garbage oh garbage yeah I

1740
01:09:54,539 --> 01:10:00,779
so [ __ ] God but Jesus Christ

1741
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,939
the perps in God Bud

1742
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:04,920
um

1743
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:07,559
I wish that never happened because other

1744
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,600
companies back up in these [ __ ] [ __ ] up

1745
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,340
for like 10 years yeah and they [ __ ]

1746
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,900
it up for other people like God Bud was

1747
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,760
from Jordan of the islands he did good

1748
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:16,500
with that they take the name slap it on

1749
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,360
their [ __ ] and just like whatever seeds

1750
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,158
we got right now this is what you get if

1751
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,839
people don't know what you get about BC

1752
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,519
Bud Depot like

1753
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,440
I mean it's one of the main advertisers

1754
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,960
in high times for many years just

1755
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:30,178
exactly smart about what you're buying

1756
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,880
um it's it's a very well-known thing

1757
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:35,279
that's been going on for a long time so

1758
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,900
just pay attention you know know what

1759
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,000
you're buying know your breeder ask your

1760
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:42,000
breeder questions ask for your questions

1761
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,100
yeah you know and that's the thing like

1762
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,920

1768
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,480
too do people really still buy their

1769
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:03,420
seats with all the Breeders out now like

1770
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:04,379
I don't know I don't I I think how do

1771
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,300
they exist

1772
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,619
like how do you think they capture all

1773
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,360
the new people just like Cali Connection

1774
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:11,158
like anybody's been around for you know

1775
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:13,259
more than five years knows their their

1776
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:15,179
gig and like they're gimmick and they

1777
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,179
don't buy it but there's a constant

1778
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:20,579
influx of new buyers constantly and

1779
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:23,039
that's what these companies rely on they

1780
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:25,019
rely on they rely on you not knowing not

1781
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,519
having done the research not knowing

1782
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,840
like if you're gonna buy cookies from

1783
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,400
them they're they know that you probably

1784
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,159
have never [ __ ] grown cookies you

1785
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:35,399
don't even know what it looks like

1786
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:37,920
there it is dude I remember uh

1787
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:39,960
when I I said the story about when I

1788
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,119
started doing like these huge grooves up

1789
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,279
in a small town called [ __ ] Valley

1790
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:45,719
um and the ones up in Three Rivers it

1791
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:47,099
was funny if it's we had talked about

1792
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:48,420
somebody else who was talking about

1793
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,940
stuff oh yeah getting out of Three

1794
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,800
Rivers yeah yeah and I was like yeah I

1795
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:55,799
was producing tons of [ __ ] out of Three

1796
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,600
Rivers but anyways yeah so the guy that

1797
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,760
was up there who owned the land had

1798
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,340
bought like thousands of dollars worth

1799
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,800
of seats legitimately like

1800
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:07,020
spent so much [ __ ] I think he ended

1801
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,880
up put like 15 16 Grand in the seats

1802
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,679
yeah but I went up there to

1803
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,539
they had growed the year before and got

1804
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,699
eight pounds of the worst garbage ever

1805
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:16,198
and they grew like thousands of plants

1806
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:18,539
so they asked me to come up and I was

1807
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,919
like yeah man I I will make this I'll do

1808
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:22,319
a thousand pound Grant I promise yeah

1809
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,640
it'll happen so he pulls out all these

1810
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,599
things he bought

1811
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:29,640
and uh PPP remember that purple Power oh

1812
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,039
yeah yeah yeah your power plant yeah

1813
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,560
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1814
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:37,738
and then he had uh BC Bud Depot's

1815
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:42,780
blueberry all right BC bug Depots got

1816
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:45,539
butts BC butt Depots the perps and uh

1817
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:48,300
God they had another one that was God

1818
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:51,420
bud and something mixed together so

1819
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,940
he had already uh popped the seeds so

1820
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:56,579
they were already little plants so I had

1821
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:58,979
taken uh at the time I was growing a lot

1822
01:12:56,579 --> 01:13:00,899
of this plant that we were calling uh

1823
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:04,019
White skunk or White Rhino

1824
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:06,599
um uh White Buds and I literally just

1825
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,820
filled up there was a mountain and it

1826
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,159
ran downhill so I started at the top and

1827
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:13,319
we just did rows going down so gravity

1828
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:15,779
could water and just like little ditches

1829
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:17,759
with little offshoots to each stump and

1830
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:19,679
we had like 300 gallon rest 300 gallon

1831
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,360
rest 300 gallon rest fill up the

1832
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,699
nutrients turn them on and it would just

1833
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:26,158
shoot down the pipes into the little

1834
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:27,719
shoots that the guys made and as they

1835
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,238
ran down they would offshoot to each

1836
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:32,698
plant so it was no plastic no anything

1837
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,198
it was just dirt you know I mean grow in

1838
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:36,000
thousands of plants is [ __ ] rough

1839
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:37,738
back then especially when it's you and

1840
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,658
like two other dudes you know you're all

1841
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:42,178
like oh [ __ ] so anyways

1842
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:44,698
he wanted to grow these so there was a

1843
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:46,199
place over by the old horse corral that

1844
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:48,299
didn't have anything in it it was a nice

1845
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:52,259
Square so I went over and planted all of

1846
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:54,360
his seeds in that horse corral uh the

1847
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:58,079
power plant one he called it purple

1848
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:59,880
Power Plant and it was purple I I don't

1849
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:02,640
know if pure power plant turns purple

1850
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,739
but that company could have had multiple

1851
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,960
things right sure and it was the

1852
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:09,599
weirdest little plant but it it was it

1853
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,140
was whatever but yeah every one of their

1854
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:16,020
blueberries were full-blown herbs

1855
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:17,940
every single one yeah every single one

1856
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,620
was full-blown term one of them was one

1857
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:21,539
of the best blueberry smells I've ever

1858
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:24,359
smelled like back to Three Rivers State

1859
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:27,539
blueberry like legitimate blueberry but

1860
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:29,219
it had more [ __ ] her balls on it than

1861
01:14:27,539 --> 01:14:32,698
you could ever imagine so you're like

1862
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:36,480
this smells great but dude there's yeah

1863
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:39,779
like half of it is balls like so then

1864
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:42,178
the God Bud was they were all just [ __ ]

1865
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:44,340
yeah there was nothing I don't know what

1866
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:46,560
it was it wasn't the pictures that they

1867
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:50,219
used online who knows yeah it was it was

1868
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,320
literally old [ __ ] Dutch [ __ ] not

1869
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:56,100
even good Dutch stuff like yeah just

1870
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:59,880
whatever they had yeah yeah and then the

1871
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:02,579
uh the perps so yeah the perps was we

1872
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:06,300
had one of them that was different it

1873
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:08,760
was like a grape jelly and um but the

1874
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:10,079
butts were small and Airy and so it

1875
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,659
wasn't something that you'd want to grow

1876
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,640
but there was something in there that

1877
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:16,439
gave it like a great jelly smell like

1878
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,239
they had something at the time that made

1879
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:20,579
it hurts you know I don't know what the

1880
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,319
[ __ ] they were using but uh that was

1881
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:25,439
kind of like when I was like to show him

1882
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:27,840
like Hey buddy um

1883
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,359
just you can't just like go into High

1884
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,100
Times magazine and like yes you know

1885
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:33,899
this company and this company they're

1886
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,940
paying a lot of money to be in that

1887
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:37,679
magazine they're not in that magazine

1888
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:40,879
because they're cool or good they didn't

1889
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:43,859
earn their spot yeah out of accolades

1890
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,279
it's our like what was the other one

1891
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:50,099
um uh the [ __ ] Vancouver Island yes

1892
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,899
Vancouver Islands yeah [ __ ] awful I

1893
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,060
call it yeah you actually bought those

1894
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:57,960
and ran them that's incredible

1895
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:59,820
I had already at that point seen BC by

1896
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:03,300
the blue trash

1897
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:05,759
um I do still I did order seeds

1898
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,800
a couple of times like when I had to

1899
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,920
have the little paper and Mark my little

1900
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:13,800
thing down and put a money order in

1901
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:16,380
um but it was like a haze strain and I

1902
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,420
got uh some stuff from Sani yeah that

1903
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:20,279
was later though um but I had got a

1904
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:24,840
couple of different hazes I still have

1905
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:26,599
one I I the Garbage barge

1906
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:30,739
um

1907
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:34,440
Uhuru Andy Randy Randy

1908
01:16:30,738 --> 01:16:37,379
it's a Randy it's like the old Cincy

1909
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:39,599
seed bank they end up changing the name

1910
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,579
I don't know but it was called boo Randy

1911
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,239
and I believe it became like sweet tooth

1912
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:47,039
or Blockhead later on in life uh

1913
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:49,198
damn it I'll have to send you the yeah

1914
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,179
yeah I'll send you a picture of it but

1915
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:52,738
it's in the the one that I did with

1916
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:53,940
Garbage barge

1917
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:55,859
um

1918
01:16:53,939 --> 01:16:57,359
God damn it man this is what I was

1919
01:16:55,859 --> 01:17:01,639
talking about the younger ones the

1920
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:04,079
brains the brains the brains

1921
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,239
but I'm pretty sure it's what ended up

1922
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,100
becoming

1923
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:09,299
either Sweet Tooth or Blockhead there

1924
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,420
was two different strains probably block

1925
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:14,159
it Blockheads like a a project 19 cross

1926
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:17,340
and it's just some weird like African

1927
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,319
sativa hybrid of some sort yeah so it

1928
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:22,440
was probably Blockhead if I know it's

1929
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:24,719
one of those two but it was

1930
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:26,819
boom boom ranthi or something it was

1931
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,619
from the region that they had got the

1932
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:30,840
seats from and that was like the first

1933
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:32,939
pack of scenes I ever ordered was those

1934
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,039
and I don't even remember why I wanted

1935
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:36,899
this

1936
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,579
that specific what yeah what pulled you

1937
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:40,799
into that I remember I want to order

1938
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:43,380
that one for twelve dollars I remember

1939
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,300
ordering like some canopy and they put

1940
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:47,340
out something called Leches at one time

1941
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,199
it's like a Lesotho Haze and I remember

1942
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:50,520
ordering it and thinking God's Gonna Be

1943
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,158
bomb and I remember getting it and

1944
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,380
thinking why did it why

1945
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:59,158
like a South African lesobo and a haze

1946
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:01,440
it's gonna be 25 weeks they grow this

1947
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:03,179
for my entire year why did I think that

1948
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:05,698
that was gonna be something for me yeah

1949
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,980
that's why I think it's funny that I see

1950
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:11,039
a lot of these projects now from guys

1951
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:13,319
who are uh just like trying to get their

1952
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,000
name onto the scene and a lot of it

1953
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:18,359
they're trying to say it's like oh this

1954
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:22,679
African Haze or the this uh Thai strain

1955
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:25,139
or this uh uh oh God Vietnamese strain

1956
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:27,260
or whatever and some of them that you

1957
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:30,539
see are legitimately

1958
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:32,039
sativa and some of them look like it and

1959
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,140
you see some of them that look like

1960
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:36,960
[ __ ] cookies and you're all

1961
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:39,420
like caps Colombian like when he said

1962
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,880
his nine-week Colombian I was like whoa

1963
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,819
I forgot he also had a land race

1964
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,920
Japanese plan

1965
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:49,019
yeah yeah

1966
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,980
she's always been super [ __ ] nice to

1967
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:52,800
me

1968
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:55,979
like like that we message and email and

1969
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:59,940
stuff but Mac isn't

1970
01:18:55,979 --> 01:19:02,099
any of those things no I could remake

1971
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:03,738
Mac from Colorado flow Super Lemon Haze

1972
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:07,260
and like a few other things it's it's

1973
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:10,259
the lemon part that constantly shows up

1974
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:12,719
and it's off projects it's breathing

1975
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:15,300
projects and then

1976
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,560
I've known Jaws

1977
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,920
or

1978
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,860
I since Canada's on yeah he was my first

1979
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:28,039
troll yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh he's

1980
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:32,579
really bad at trolling uh but uh he has

1981
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:36,060
like all these alien cookie candy yeah

1982
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:39,719
yeah candy cookie aliens alien rocks and

1983
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:42,659
all these different strengths and uh

1984
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:45,960
that I could imagine that and lemon haze

1985
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:47,579
type or I don't even know if it's like

1986
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:50,100
pure Lemon Haze

1987
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:53,698
um there was that uh really soft lemon

1988
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:57,360
plant that was going around

1989
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:59,639
right you know a couple of years before

1990
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:03,119
that came out

1991
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:04,739
um before Matt came out and uh I

1992
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:06,238
remember growing it and I was like wow

1993
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:08,579
that's really interesting the way it

1994
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,519
looked because it had these puffier buds

1995
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:14,640
but they kind of looked like how scdc

1996
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,300
looks like oh really yeah yeah it's not

1997
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:20,219
like a sativa like it was like like

1998
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:22,320
almost like Northern Lights you know

1999
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:24,658
like like it has a structure to it you

2000
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,000
know but it had this lemony zestiness to

2001
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:28,559
it which I still don't know what the

2002
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,060
plant was like I was given the plant

2003
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,179
they were like I don't know what it is

2004
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:35,640
and I was really intrigued by it super

2005
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:38,100
resonated I mean all right

2006
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,820
erase all that imagine purple punch with

2007
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,520
lemon

2008
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:44,639
thank you instead that's what it was not

2009
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:48,000
as resonated as purple punch but for the

2010
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:50,159
time you [ __ ] resonated yeah

2011
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,960
it wasn't as powdery of a resinous

2012
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:54,599
purple punch there was a little more of

2013
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:58,260
an oil stickiness too yeah but it had a

2014
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:00,900
soft like not like a lemon chemical like

2015
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:04,020
a like a like a lemon peel like a sweet

2016
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:05,879
like a Meyer lemon type thing this thing

2017
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:08,760
Sweet Lemon there yeah it was the thing

2018
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:11,340
but it was there and I grew it for a

2019
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,840
while and I I was like I could like you

2020
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,119
wanted to smoke it like because like

2021
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,400
that flavor yeah yeah goddamn you'd want

2022
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:20,099
to put joints out halfway so you could

2023
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:21,599
smoke it again yeah yeah yeah not the

2024
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,940
half out joint that joint got thrown

2025
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,679
away because

2026
01:21:22,939 --> 01:21:27,359
I like joints so I can have an MF gets

2027
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,399
there now and then I will like I want to

2028
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:31,219
do fresh green one I don't want that

2029
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:34,639
other [ __ ]

2030
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:38,460
I need to smoke that [ __ ] Till It's Gone

2031
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:40,199
But I am such a press now it's like no I

2032
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,239
only want good fresh green [ __ ] that's

2033
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:44,519
it I want all the fresh turnips right

2034
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:45,959
now have you have you seen the riptek

2035
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,780
thing that I used did I show that to you

2036
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:51,179
the [ __ ] it looks like in anal

2037
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:54,119
torture device but it's a glass probe

2038
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:56,340
that Heats and it connects to a bowl and

2039
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:58,439
it and it has like holes on the side so

2040
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:01,020
when you suck it you're sucking air down

2041
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:03,359
through this like heat Vortex that goes

2042
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,739
into the bowl into a bong so you can

2043
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,779
actually like

2044
01:22:04,738 --> 01:22:09,479
you hit a bong of vapor it's it's

2045
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:12,300
amazing that's okay you can get some of

2046
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,799
the most amazing like a lot of the Terps

2047
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,260
that normally you wouldn't get through

2048
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,880
vaporization or combustion for whatever

2049
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,800
reason because you can dial it in So

2050
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,940
Perfect like you can get so many

2051
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,159
different flavors that you normally

2052
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:25,019
wouldn't expect it to be in a Bud that

2053
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:26,759
you smell and it's it's pretty

2054
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,560
phenomenal I don't think they make them

2055
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,340
anymore but they they should if they

2056
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,580
don't

2057
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:35,219
I know when I first started to like not

2058
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:37,920
put fire on the ball like keep my

2059
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:40,020
lighter up high and like like trying to

2060
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,000
use the heat from it yeah yes and that

2061
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:43,440
was the first like time like I was young

2062
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,520
when I started learning that that was

2063
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,579
like the first time where I was like

2064
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:49,199
holy [ __ ] like that tastes way [ __ ]

2065
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:50,760
different back then it was brick weed

2066
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,738
and yeah of course

2067
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:55,380
I wish people could see some of the good

2068
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:56,939
Breakaway holy [ __ ] there was some that

2069
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,500
would come in uncompressed that was

2070
01:22:56,939 --> 01:23:02,219
really nice every once in a while big

2071
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:05,819
[ __ ] buds my my dad had uh

2072
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:08,760
so my dad would go to Mexico

2073
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:10,259
yeah and bring in hundreds of keys and

2074
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,940
uh they would all be labeled in

2075
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,140
different colors I I don't know if I've

2076
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:15,479
said the story but I'm gonna say it

2077
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:17,520
anyways yeah go ahead so there would be

2078
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:18,839
like black uh ones that were wrapped in

2079
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,300
black and those were like for his

2080
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:23,100
personal like these you keep then they'd

2081
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,199
be green red orange and [ __ ] like that

2082
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,840
and each one of them was a step down

2083
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:30,899
yeah so when you finally got Kai you got

2084
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,640
caught with 180 of them but uh yeah

2085
01:23:30,899 --> 01:23:34,500

2106
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,880
smelled like skunk so they called it

2107
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:19,199
yeah they called it [ __ ] skunk you

2108
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,539

2109
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:24,119
so ah

2110
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:26,100
yeah and then there was a guy he's

2111
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:27,539
they're all they're all passed now so I

2112
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:30,480
don't feel bad news in their names he

2113
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:34,198
went by Mikey Dale and uh so when my dad

2114
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,939
left uh so my dad worked the fields they

2115
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:38,099
were field workers and that's where he

2116
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:40,198
met all the young uh the Mexican kids

2117
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:42,360
they all grew up together and so then

2118
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:44,339
when they all went back to Mexico

2119
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:45,779
my dad stayed here and he was in high

2120
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,039
school they would come back for the

2121
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:48,899
summer and they would bring weed with

2122
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,640
them and stuff and uh they'd make like

2123
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:52,198
little pipes he said out of like the

2124
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,600
grapevines because you could Hollow them

2125
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:56,759
out and like smoke it like that and uh

2126
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,199
he was also by the time I graduated high

2127
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:01,020
school uh he was going to play

2128
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:04,019
professional baseball and he got drafted

2129
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:07,500
by the Angels oh wow this [ __ ] and uh

2130
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:09,480
instead my mom got pregnant and uh she

2131
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,600
went and let them leave so he's all like

2132
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:14,039
well I gotta make money so he hooked up

2133
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,280
with his old buddy so he was just

2134
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:20,039
driving back and forth yeah uh into the

2135
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,658
border and uh most of the time he didn't

2136
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:23,100
actually have to go into Mexico they

2137
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:25,439
would just meet down on one of the

2138
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,880
Border areas he just pull up and they

2139
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:29,639
would be waiting and loaded up the

2140
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:32,039
[ __ ] videos off and gone

2141
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:34,560
but he still would tell me like and

2142
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:36,658
before he passed I was growing a lot of

2143
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,480
really good we like I was growing a lot

2144
01:25:36,658 --> 01:25:40,920
of [ __ ] really good weed and he would

2145
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:43,439
compare it

2146
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,658
to some of the stuff that he would have

2147
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,000
back then now he would say most of the

2148
01:25:45,658 --> 01:25:50,158
stuff that I was growing now was way

2149
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,520
[ __ ] better but there were still a

2150
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,859
few that he would get uh but those

2151
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,739
Growers those generational Growers those

2152
01:25:55,859 --> 01:26:00,960
Family Growers they did get run out they

2153
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:03,359
they lost all their land they recorded

2154
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,560
out by cartels and and big money and

2155
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,719
things like that

2156
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,639
so those people who are growing and my

2157
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,100
dad was getting it from they no longer

2158
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:13,319
exist their genetics are gone and then

2159
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:16,260
when the new [ __ ] Growers came in

2160
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:19,920
there they were trying to grow whatever

2161
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:22,980
I've seen their grows in in Mexico I've

2162
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,179
seen how they grow it here yeah I've

2163
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:27,658
been on

2164
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:30,179
actual cartel grows I've

2165
01:26:27,658 --> 01:26:33,359
I've been told that I was going to be

2166
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:35,699
kidnapped and all kinds of crazy [ __ ] so

2167
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:37,380
I could go and build grows and yeah just

2168
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:39,479
wild stuff so like I needed to be

2169
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:42,359
careful and

2170
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:45,658
due to some of the [ __ ] craziest [ __ ]

2171
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:48,299
um so anyways uh it's horrible they

2172
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:50,879
literally will just have like a sack of

2173
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:53,340
seeds and they were just throwing them

2174
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,039
down like you would [ __ ] corn yeah of

2175
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:59,039
course just growing out and males and

2176
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:01,679
females and it didn't [ __ ] matter the

2177
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:04,079
good Growers knew not to do that the

2178
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,119
good Growers cold meals and they

2179
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:09,420
actually bred what they wanted for the

2180
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:12,899
next season and and it was like um

2181
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:15,060
in what is it Morocco I think the really

2182
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:18,539
good hash most of their hash was made

2183
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:20,520
like from the year before so the plants

2184
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:23,100
that they would Harvest they would sit

2185
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:25,500
all [ __ ] winter and then they would

2186
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:27,239
start growing the next year and that's

2187
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,760
when they started making the hash that

2188
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:31,559
was plants are old and beat up and all

2189
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,679
that stuff yeah I think laying in dirt

2190
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:37,020
yeah exactly but it was easier for that

2191
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:39,000
[ __ ] separation of the trichome you

2192
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:42,239
know and yeah they just sit there

2193
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,000
yeah tap that [ __ ] yeah tap it over the

2194
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:47,279
sieve screens but the also

2195
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,260
I also was told like learn from some of

2196
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:52,198
the older guys who did serve a Vietnam

2197
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:54,679
that yeah they would they would uh bury

2198
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:57,599
the Cannabis even when it was wet yeah

2199
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:58,980
molds yeah and it would ferment and then

2200
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,900
they would smoke it and it would be like

2201
01:27:58,979 --> 01:28:03,119
a loose in The Chins yeah that's what

2202
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:05,059
it's What DJ Short and his book referred

2203
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,979
to as African black magic which is

2204
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:10,139
fermented Malawi cob

2205
01:28:07,979 --> 01:28:11,959
um like buried in a corn cob and stuff

2206
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:17,219
yeah it's wild

2207
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:19,380
smoking beer yeah and so I uh the friend

01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:50,219
looks like

2246
01:29:46,219 --> 01:29:53,698
look at that can you see it yeah it's

2247
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:56,760
like electric yes yeah and in this end

2248
01:29:53,698 --> 01:29:58,439
attaches to a bowl and it never touches

2249
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:02,760
the weed it only Heats it to a certain

2250
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:06,000
temperature and it's it's I don't know

2251
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,380
anymore but it was seriously like I

2252
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,819
would buy this company if I could

2253
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,000
because it was it was that old

2254
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:14,880
revolutionary of a of a thing for me oh

2255
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,560
yeah smoke that I could imagine because

2256
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,300
all Vapes are kind of the same you know

2257
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,000
vaporizers you know there's a hot plate

2258
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:23,159
and they exactly the flower like it's

2259
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,619
not due with ceramic plates secondary

2260
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:27,599
heat yeah there's actual contact with

2261
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:30,179
this like you're heating something

2262
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,340
that's heating something else every

2263
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:35,520
single Vape I've ever smoked oh there's

2264
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:37,079
always this uh popcorn taste to it that

2265
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,179
never that's always there like no matter

2266
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:40,559
what you do yeah and this doesn't have

2267
01:30:39,179 --> 01:30:42,119
that because you can dial it in so

2268
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,679
perfect and it's secondary heat it's not

2269
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:45,719
touching the butt oh it's just so cool

2270
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,340
hopefully [ __ ] it I I do hope the

2271
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:48,840
company gets I remember the last time I

2272
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,279
talked to him someone wanted to buy one

2273
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:53,219
and they said they didn't have any

2274
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:57,259
American plugs for them which whatever

2275
01:30:53,219 --> 01:31:01,079
that means they don't have to hear it um

2276
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:03,539
yeah but yeah I mean they're so worth it

2277
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:05,639
anybody who like wants to sample or or

2278
01:31:03,539 --> 01:31:08,158
try any cannabis and get the real like

2279
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:09,779
flavor profile and and really nail it

2280
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:10,979
it's the easiest way to do it because

2281
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:12,300
you're not you're not tasting the

2282
01:31:10,979 --> 01:31:13,678
chlorophyll and all the other stuff that

2283
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:16,920
you're trying to move through you know

2284
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:19,440
yeah like we don't really like

2285
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,539
yeah I understand like you want to get

2286
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,099
that flavor you just want that Essence

2287
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:24,920
and that's why you just want the oil and

2288
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:27,120
that's all it is yeah

2289
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:29,699
the combustion gives you a different

2290
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:32,519
high like compare the fleet but if you

2291
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:35,638
want to just pure flavor this thing

2292
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:38,060
makes me uh I can imagine flowers and

2293
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:38,060
just be like

2294
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,880
and I I didn't I thought it would be a

2295
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:43,259
lot lighter because I don't know why

2296
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,579
like you don't get as much smoke in your

2297
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:46,199
lungs because it's vapor so it doesn't

2298
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:47,279
feel the same thing if you're gonna get

2299
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:48,479
as high yeah you don't think you're

2300
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:50,340
gonna get as high for whatever reason

2301
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:53,399
but I always end up doing the mumble

2302
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:55,800
jumble like after we come from the time

2303
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:58,039
when if it we didn't choke we weren't

2304
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:01,619
smoking like you know

2305
01:31:58,039 --> 01:32:03,479
yeah exactly exactly you know like man

2306
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:06,800
my weed never makes me [ __ ] cough

2307
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:09,899
anymore it's so smooth now you know like

2308
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:12,539
oh I love you I don't cough anymore

2309
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:15,420
that's true it's I think these things

2310
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:17,819
are just so filled with [ __ ] and ass but

2311
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:19,920
lungs are just so [ __ ] wrecked it's

2312
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:22,259
all like I don't care I'm good let's

2313
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:25,380
smoke some of that dirty dirt and we

2314
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:26,760
just look dirty dirt oh God damn you

2315
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,500
don't even know some of it I mean we

2316
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:32,340
don't even know what dirty dirt we smoke

2317
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:35,719
to be honest God no God no the nastiest

2318
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:35,719
of pesticides yeah

2319
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:43,619
yeah we have done a whole nother episode

2320
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:47,579
and I'm sure we can pile down a hundred

2321
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:49,800
thousand more problems so yeah but yeah

2322
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:53,819
uh this is this is the smell boat

2323
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:55,619
episode two yeah episode two and this

2324
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:58,139
time we actually have a time for the

2325
01:32:55,619 --> 01:32:59,939
release of the beans I know yeah so we

2326
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:02,219
should have them out in a week which

2327
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:06,000
might mean two for us it might be two

2328
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:08,279
enough uh tin is the max 10 is the max

2329
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,600
yes uh and I think there might be five

2330
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,179
of one of them I'm gonna have to look

2331
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,880
but I think it's ten packs Max and

2332
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:16,560
that's it okay literally from that one

2333
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,340
that'll be it so if you really want

2334
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,900
something

2335
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:21,000
um

2336
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:23,399
I don't flood [ __ ] like I just don't

2337
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,479
flood my markets I never have I never

2338
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:26,219
will

2339
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,359
so if you buy some of my seeds you're

2340
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:29,880
getting something that other

2341
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:32,399
[ __ ] won't have and you know

2342
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:36,179
it's it's just different it's it's good

2343
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:39,179
uh I think uh I think picking these ones

2344
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:41,100
first is uh I think people are gonna

2345
01:33:39,179 --> 01:33:44,219
like freak [ __ ] out

2346
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:46,920

2347
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:49,079

sister I haven't done the rainbow for me

2351
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:58,138
when I see you yeah I have another one

2352
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,760
that I haven't shown off as much because

2353
01:33:58,139 --> 01:34:01,920
she's kind of ugly it's the only rainbow

2354
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,320
I've ever found that was ugly but it

2355
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:06,300
really pulls the OG like the old school

2356
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,880
old school OG

2357
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:11,159
um but good God like you literally could

2358
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:13,319
like squeeze the buds and it would stick

2359
01:34:11,158 --> 01:34:14,579
to the wall for all day yeah you could

2360
01:34:13,319 --> 01:34:17,460
just stick it on there and it wouldn't

2361
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:19,679
[ __ ] come off it's like that sap it's

2362
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:21,658
like I remember my dad told me that when

2363
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,980
at first afghanis came through that was

2364
01:34:21,658 --> 01:34:23,638
the one thing they noticed is that you

2365
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:25,319
could

2366
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:26,880
stick it on a wall and they all said

2367
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:30,380
like it would stick to the wall they

2368
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:33,779
were so surprised by it because it does

2369
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:36,119
yeah it pops when you smoke it the the

2370
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:38,099
resin pots inside there's like these

2371
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:40,260
little pods and they have like sap

2372
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,360
inside of it so when you smoke it you'll

2373
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:44,340
actually see it looks like fireworks

2374
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:45,899
and people that are inexperiencing

2375
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:47,340
people like oh you need to flush it

2376
01:34:45,899 --> 01:34:50,339
better yeah yeah

2377
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:53,639

2380
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:02,219
where the pods get so filled with

2381
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,520
[ __ ] resin that like as you're

2382
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:06,739
smoking it they like they sparkle the

2383
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,360
[ __ ]

2384
01:35:06,738 --> 01:35:11,698
