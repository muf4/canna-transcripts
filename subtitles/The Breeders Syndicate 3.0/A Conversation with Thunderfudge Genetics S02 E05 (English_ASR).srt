59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
wallow through it you know i compared

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
you know trying to work a line is like

61
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
being the kid that has to practice the

62
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,598
trumpet you know while the other kids

63
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
are out you know

64
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,238
going ape [ __ ] out you know

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,439
[ __ ] playing in the summer and you're

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,599
kind of stuck moving in one direction

67
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,519
and it's you know that's tedious but you

68
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,238
know it's it's rewarding at a point you

69
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,719
know

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,840
yeah yeah it's it's something i mean

71
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,080
like it used to be the standard but yeah

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,319
right not for much anymore you know not

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,719
so much anymore you know i mean the way

74
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,560
the market moves and and the attention

75
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,039
spans and

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,199
and what not a kids it's just you know

77
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,199
it moves through it so fast you know i

78
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,839
have a buddy doing a wreck and you know

79
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,479
he said he's he's flipping uh you know

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,080
trains out you know every two to three

81
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,759
runs they're just two to three and done

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
you know

83
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:48,239
you know that fast so it's really

84
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,639
tough to do what we do in this industry

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
if you want to

86
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,158
you know you want to play with that hype

87
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,079
stuff or you know you want to stick to

88
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,000
your guns and and wait till you know if

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
you're not in that hot zone wait till

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,759
what you're doing comes

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,080
back you know

92
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,399
back in basically yeah

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,280
it's like it used to be at least like

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,879
for me five six years seven years before

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,479
something would come back around that i

96
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,679
made that wasn't popular

97
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,000
and then everybody'd want it and it

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,680
would be old seeds or i would just be

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,279
i've already given them all out for free

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
you know at some point because they

101
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,000
didn't sell

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,040
exactly exactly exactly and i mean

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,759
that's that's the tough one is nowadays

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,800
i think a lot of breeders just kind of

105
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,160
they throw those filler plants in that

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,759
you know they're not going to be the

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
main you know

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,639
bangers out of what they're dropping but

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,360
they're going to be plants that just you

110
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,319
know

111
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,720
kind of make money and i think you know

112
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,319
a lot of plants are thrown in in guys

113
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
menus as

114
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,159
options rather than choices you know

115
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,079
like yeah

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
you know i get thousand plants you know

117
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,879
i can get you know i can get 4 000 bucks

118
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
off that plant you know or or whatever

119
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,478
you know and they're they're pushing big

120
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,399
plants and just pollinate the [ __ ] out

121
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:10,959
of them and you know moving on to the

122
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,959
next one on and on and on you

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
something i've been covering lately a

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,759
lot just like trying to explain to

125
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,679
people the difference between

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,160
how we used to do it and now where the

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,720
market is pushing everyone to go like it

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,800
that like testing was a given and if

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,400
someone didn't test like we always would

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,038
give them [ __ ] it's like yeah [ __ ] you

131
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,279
ain't even testing that [ __ ] now

132
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,279
they got the [ __ ] advantage bro they

133
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,839
got the yeah yeah there was always

134
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,359
almost one guy to come in you know hey

135
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,038
uh i assume this is untested you know

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,360
and then you know all the hype boys be

137
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,839
like shut up you know oh you know aliens

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,479
genetics 2012 you know

139
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,839
we all saw that go down and and

140
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,560
that became our our new norm you know

141
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,758
yeah it did it did it [ __ ] sucks it

142
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,959
really sucks

143
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,879
because waiting

144
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,478
like i mean if you're going like if

145
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,600
you're hitting it hard running as fast

146
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,359
as you can

147
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
with a brand new line you're you're

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
making a cross and testing it you're at

149
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,839
least 18 months in if you're doing it

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
right like and actually seeing if

151
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,839
anything's good running it all the way

152
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,038
out you know and yeah

153
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,839
and that is not a um time span that

154
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,839
works for the current market

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,960
and there you know you see a lot of

156
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,839
people and they're you know claiming

157
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,719
they work just to f6 or you know bat

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,198
cross five or something and you you you

159
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,680
you go back on their feed and it's just

160
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,000
the arithmetic just doesn't lie you know

161
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,160
it's like dude you know you you

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,319
obviously just pulled the two best

163
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
looking plants you had and set them

164
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
aside and bred those together you know

165
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,520
there was no

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,960
there was no full look at it you know

167
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,598
you were you're you're gambling you know

168
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,918
absolutely gambling you know yeah it's

169
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,519
always a gamble but i think like what

170
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,879
guys i want i won't name any names but

171
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,478
there's a lot of guys who have figured

172
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,478
out the plan that

173
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,758
if they sell seeds that the majority of

174
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,639
the market

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,038
is not going to grow out those seeds for

176
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,879
at least a year year and a half maybe

177
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,478
sometimes longer so a lot of the

178
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,959
negative feedback they've got like two

179
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,639
years in to to [ __ ] just put a bunch

180
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,839
of [ __ ] out and run and that's

181
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,759
that's that's the the time span for it

182
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,679
yeah yeah there's a lot of guys that

183
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,000

346
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,559
coming from europe you know we were

347
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
still

348
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,319
you know in the 2000s and and though you

349
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,719
know we saw some great california weeds

350
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,120
show up in the fall you know it was

351
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,160
you know unless you had the balls to run

352
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,799
the i5 corridor there just wasn't a lot

353
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,719
of it you know later on

354
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,559
towards seven and eight you know hell

355
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
people were just flying up and down that

356
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,559
thing and then you guys actually just

357
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
flooded our freaking market out you know

358
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,919
at a point

359
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,720
during those years like yeah 2006 2007

360
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,559
like

361
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,240
amsterdam if people don't know amsterdam

362
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,078
amsterdam was that those seed companies

363
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,000
were still dominating the american seed

364
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,078
companies they were small there were

365
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,159
very few big ones i think at that time

366
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,799
me and subcool were the only ones on the

367
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,480
attitude which had just taken the market

368
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,958
over the attitude it just started and

369
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,360
taking the market over so yeah i mean

370
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,919
that's why that's why guys in the u.s

371
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
were getting our seeds from amsterdam

372
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,360
because that's what you did that was

373
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
what was in demand

374
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
and you know it was it was a long time

375
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,879
it could be four or five months before

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,839
you got your seeds back then you know

377
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,000

402
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,159
you know once we were building a room

403

were putting the walls up you know it

407
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,919
was like you know what what can we do

408

and at the time you know mike had made

409
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,759
seeds but

410
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
he wasn't like actively pushing them or

411
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,639
anything you know

412
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,519
really modest about it and and i know

413
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,039

414
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,959
yeah you know it's a long time ago and

415
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,439
you know it's like you know how how can

416
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,838

you know

418
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
how you compete

419
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,240
the first answer was was sub cool seats

420
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,439
because you know he was in every

421
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,839
dispensary on you know every corner here

422

in washington you know so every every

423
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,399
magazine you could pick up with subco at

424
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,800
the time sure oh yeah and he had just

425
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,039
absolutely saturated the market with

426
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,879
those you know fifty dollar freaking

427
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,000
forty dollar packs you know they were

428
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,399
everywhere

429
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,759
and uh you know so mike had a few slave

430
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,000
crosses and whatnot and uh you know we

431
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,399
we started kind of pushing them on this

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,198
uh this thing called the northwest green

433
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,679
thumb

434
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,479
which was our our medical forums and it

435
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,479
actually you know became pretty big and

436
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,240
there was a lot of michigan guys on

437
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,159
there and you know a lot of guys that

438
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,159
poke in there just just for fun and

439
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,639
whatnot because sure there's so much

440
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,559
[ __ ] talking it was just ridiculous but

441
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,959
uh uh

442
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:08,159

446
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,919

starfighter stuff or anything descended

500
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,720
from it

501
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,879
you can always tell that it has the

502
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,919
alien technology like [ __ ] resin

503
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,760
rails the type of resin

504
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,799
it breathes very true for all that stuff

505
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,679
yeah exactly and his mail you know i

506
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,440
mean i gotta say kudos man i mean he

507
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,080
he picked a solid male and that thing

508
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,080
was just like a freaking car wash man it

509
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,639
would just you could you could put an

510
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,879
average plan in there and it would just

511
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,520
shine it you know i mean it had great

512
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,240
it had great traits as far as that went

513
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,319
the only downfall and i think what moved

514
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
him away was you know one he didn't want

515
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,639
to be a one-trick pony you know and and

516
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,480
number two is you know if you look at

517
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,520
the numbers i mean it has high thca

518
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
but

519
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,679
the rest of the categories are zeros you

520
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
know i mean

521
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,640
there's there's not much else other than

522
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,359
that dhca in there you know

523
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,520
so you know i mean it kind of you know

524
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,759
it kind of hit its ceiling and i think

525
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,359
you know that's what kind of it led to

526
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,240
its demise it's

527
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,879
you know

528
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,079
people were were expanding on on that

529
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,640
stuff and and you know that new bar of

530
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:27,199
26 percent thc you know in in 12 or 13

531
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,840
you know and you know went from like 17

532

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,798
you need to hit a civilian up that

828
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,600
doesn't grow that can't get any

829
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:48,639
collateral damage and pay them you know

830
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,719
to nurse that thing back to hell so

831
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,320
yeah i went and bought a light and and

832
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,440
you know bought bought some azmax and

833
00:31:54,319 --> 00:32:00,158
i bought some you know one step uh

834
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,000
oh god i can't remember that one-step

835
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:06,320
food you know just basic blue yeah uh

836
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,038

837
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,038
to give it to me clean and and you know

838
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,038
it's like three months later i got this

839
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,200
plant back that was just you know

840
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,359
thoroughly shellacked and barely alive

841
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,759
it was so locked out and

842
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:24,398
you know the the process begun you know

843
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:26,720

844
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,798
you know man it's i compare you know all

845
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,519
breeding man is just just like building

846
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,359
a house man or a car or anything man you

847
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,000
know you you start with the best

848
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,479
foundation you can and you just you just

849
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,480
build up from there man and

850
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,480
you know you just take your time and do

851
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,720
it right man you know and

852
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,558
you could see there for you know about

853
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,558
four years man a lot of people were just

854
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,200
having it you know breeders were having

855
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,359
terrible luck with with with intersexing

856
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
and whatnot and i mean it's become a lot

857
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,959
more

858
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,240
you know accepted and what not on a

859
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,880
small

860
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,640
you know a smaller level but you know

861
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,559
people weren't looking at their males

862
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,038
and and they were just throwing anything

863
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,960
in and it is it really showed it really

864
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,398
[ __ ] up a lot of good gene pools you

865
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,159
know and and

866
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,239
you know i i

867
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,240
i just try to start the best plants and

868
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,038
then you know as many as i can like you

869
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,519
know

870
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,519
like we both know you know if you if you

871
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,880
say you're gonna do something you know

872
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,440
and yet you put 20 down to get a you

873
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,519
know a a mission done and get some seeds

874
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,519
made you know i mean

875
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,519
[ __ ] it's going to take 40 you know and

876
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,839
when you don't expect it you get exactly

877
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,079
what you want so yeah exactly

878
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,240
i'm kind of at the point where i just i

879
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,519
just pop seeds i want to pop and i hope

880
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,359
for the best and i realize that you know

881
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,720
you know you can't make it happen until

882
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,599
it's there and

883
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,519
you know

884
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,519
you just don't force it you know we

885
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,640
don't you know this industry doesn't

886
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,399
need any more four seats you know and

887
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
you know i tell a lot of people do keep

888
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,518
your [ __ ] day job you know because

889
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,879
you know there's always that dude that

890
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,038
hits you up and they're gonna be then

891
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,200
they're like man i'm gonna be the next

892
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,519
seed junkie and you're like yeah yeah

893
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,240
right on bro man you know good luck to

894
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,039
you test your [ __ ] just don't quit your

895
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,398
day job you know yeah and

896
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,119
you know i

897
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:20,000
i think if a lot of people did this just

898
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,639
for fun or whatever you know then and

899
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,960
game would be a lot cooler you know the

900
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,358
the the people that don't smoke pot and

901
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,199
breed you know and and can't even give

902
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,918
descriptions of what the hell they're

903
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,799
working with or what they have or or

904
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,480
what to expect man you know i mean at

905
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,960
least you know you're gonna apply

906
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,719
somebody with a with a prediction you

907
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,199
know and and you know a lot of people

908
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:46,319
say that you know a good breeder just

909
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,759
can predict the outcome to an extent of

910
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,359
what you're going to find in his packs

911
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,200
you know and yeah

912
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,358
we all should be able to do that man

913
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,960
that's just taking responsibility for

914
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,559
what you're making you know yeah that's

915
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,240
just knowing what you're working with in

916
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,519
the first place like you don't just pop

917
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,879
and make you have to know what you're

918
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,960
working with to see if it's worth

919
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,240
breeding within the first place yeah

920
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,800
right

921
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:10,319
there it is and the other one is guys

922
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,119
that are picking up other guys's f3s and

923
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,680
and

924
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,320
you know making f4s first of all you

925
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,319
know we know these aren't actual f gens

926
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,359
yeah about correct well we'll call them

927
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,440
industry afghans because i i test that

928
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,358
for my pack but i'll just let you guys

929
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,679
know i don't know what an actual filial

930
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,759
jam is but

931
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,078
we'll stop there but guys that are

932
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,000
taking these packs they've they've never

933
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,920
never ran any of these northern lights

934
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,358
they've never ran great baby for these

935
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,440
granddads

936
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,679
and they're making [ __ ] the next

937
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,039
generation of seeds with them and it's

938
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,440
like dude you

939
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,358
you've never smoked real gdp in your

940
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,440
whole life and you're you're

941
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,199
you're making granddaddy hurt things

942
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,679
right now yeah

943
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,159
for one pack off ten seats you know

944
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,759
sometimes even less you know and

945
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,639
you know some of that needs to just go

946
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,280
away you know but but

947
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,279
back to you know the 08 you know i i

948
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,880
tested everything i beat the [ __ ] out of

949
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,960
everything

950
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,599
out crossed it to a few more things and

951
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,280
then eventually made the f2s and it was

952
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,039
actually

953
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,280
fit almost

954
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,000
seven

955
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,760
years for me to make the f3s you know i

956
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,119
mean i grew a lot of them and i i

957
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,400
thought it was just like one of the

958
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,640
coolest crosses i had ever grown but i

959
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,079
couldn't figure out where

960
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,319
to take it

961
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,960
and then i kind of realized man there's

962
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,838
no need to really take anything anywhere

963
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,280
you know and so i'm i'm kind of an

964
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,480
anti-bottleneck guy now you know i'm

965
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,800
more issue

966
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,280
you know i'm more into

967
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,160
four males and

968
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,760
two females all on the same gene

969
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,598
frequency you know a micro population of

970
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,760
similar plants where

971
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,320
you know i can call some stuff i don't

972
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,960
want out you know more more suspense

973
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,200
features or or whatnot you know but you

974
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,440
know if i'm aiming for a an indica i

975
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:09,358
mean i shouldn't be really necessarily

976
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,559
looking at some plants in in my pool of

977
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,960
plants i have to use you know you know

978
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:18,239
you know i call the whole time and you

979
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,159
know try to get myself down to a decent

980
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,399
sized micro pool

981
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,960
you know out of a larger population and

982
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,680
then throw those flower them do what i

983
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,519
need to do and then take those clones

984
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,519
then i can actually you know make a

985
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,639
generation of seeds and feel confident

986
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,559
about

987
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,039
what i'm putting on the table what

988
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,320
everything has to offer what i've seen

989
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,400
what to expect you know just just you

990
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,720
know i don't i don't have a big tester

991
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,639
truth you know so yeah

992
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,358
you know for me it's just you know

993
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,199
sometimes easier to do it myself and

994
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,119
that's kind of what slowed me down this

995
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,598
year i really haven't done any paper

996
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,519
drops just because i've just been been

997
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,400
finding the plants i want to work with

998
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,199
man stuff that inspires me versus just

999
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,639
you know currency man you know i don't

1000
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,199
you know i

1001
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,199
i do okay enough that i don't

1002
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,639
need to make seats for a living and i'm

1003
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,960
[ __ ] there's nothing wrong with that

1004
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,279
man a lot of everybody's good enough to

1005
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,838
do it and there's a ton of guys doing it

1006
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,000
and [ __ ] props to everybody this this

1007
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:23,119
is a part-time thing for me and and i

1008
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,960
realized at a point that it kind of

1009
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,280
became about the money for a split

1010
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,039
second and i i kind of

1011
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,800
realized that you know it was great

1012
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,279
because every breeder boy you get your

1013
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,960
first drop in and it's just like

1014

00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,400
[ __ ]

1017

1067
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,039

1092
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,440
i usually wait 10 days before i start

1093
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,200
smoking again it should probably be two

1094
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,440
months but you know i'm right on the

1095
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:26,960
clock again for it happening again so

1096
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,200
that sucks you know my tolerance is low

1097
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,159

because it you know it it it

1108

1109
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,519

1113
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,639

00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,719
you know and and

1118
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,399
i just kind of at a point when elite was

1119
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,358
out that last time and just kind of

1120
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,000
bugging me i just felt like dude i i

1121

1122
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,880
anything to do with you dude and every

1123
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,639
every time he got out and said you know

okay can i get some she can i get a

1125
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,799
package and then it was one it's two and

1126
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:45,440
he just he he just never just he never

1127
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,440

1128
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,280
yeah life

1129
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,119
well the thing with this [ __ ] too like

1130
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,440
if we're being real like all this early

1131
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,440
[ __ ] like none of it was consistent you

1132
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,519
could buy two packs with one name on it

1133
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,079
be completely different but because he

1134
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,079
was using like bubba and og early on

1135
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,519
like most of it was pretty decent

1136
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,440
compared to what other people were

1137
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,358
putting out but trying to figure out

1138
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,200
what [ __ ] really was in your packs was

1139
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,440
[ __ ] impossible

1140
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,439
exactly dude i told them that at a point

1141
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,079
it's like you know he he'd hit me up and

1142
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,079
say stuff like oh dude you must be rich

1143
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,240
from using my stuff in your gear you

1144
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,560

1145
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,559

1146
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,480

1147
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,960

oh [ __ ] probably six years ago or

1342
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,920
something but you know that's

1343
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,960
just one that got eight eaten by the

1344
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,358
dogs

1345
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,280

1346
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,078
those left

1347
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,160
i i always try to

1348
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,039
if i'm fond of something i want to give

1349
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,358
the time it deserves so i i hoard a lot

1350
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:23,039
of seeds that i make because

1351
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,039
it's just not the time you know

1352
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,000
i really want to work these but it's

1353
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,838
just i've got other [ __ ] on the plate

1354
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,719
and if i can't you know give it 150

1355
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,119
percent

1356
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,118
i can't [ __ ] with this and

1357
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,519
i had a lot of stuff that whole bag was

1358
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,838
stuffed like that and they ate the whole

1359
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,480
bag and oh no

1360
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:46,639
a pack of you know starfighter f2s which

1361
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,599
i had a thousand dollar offer for oh

1362
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,279
there was old rascal gear in there and

1363
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,640
it was it was a big bag of seeds was

1364
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,240
this recently

1365
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,239
uh this was last

1366
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,960
last

1367
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,239
halloween yeah i kind of remember when

1368
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,318
all this happened because i remember you

1369
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,759
busting out rascal gear and i was like

1370
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:09,838
oh [ __ ] yeah oh yeah yeah yeah just just

1371
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,240
all of it just wasted and then you know

1372
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,960
that gave me a big pile of uh

1373
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:17,279
just floor hash seeds and i did end up

1374
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,159
sending all those to speak easy and you

1375
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,319
know

1376
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,719
we might have to find a few definite

1377
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:25,279
plants out of there you know there's i

1378
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:26,159
had a sour larry to uh

1379
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,079
uh

1380
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:29,440
zeus cut to

1381
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,720
some

1382
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,838
of the

1383
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,838
ultimate sfb cam that uh yeah

1384
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,599
karma had given me a bunch of packs back

1385
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,799
in the day to run through

1386
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,440
and uh uh he gave me the ultimate sfv

1387
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,680
cam which is a completely different plan

1388
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,559
you know the i'd say the kimo 8 you know

1389
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:53,199
was a nice sour cam and and the uh

1390
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:56,240
the uh the sfv cam has a lot of uh

1391
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,480
he he said he put uh

1392
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,838
swerves

1393
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:04,960
sfvbx in there that was crossed to

1394
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:07,119
supposedly an appy bx

1395
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,599
you know and uh

1396
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,599
i do get a lot of

1397
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,200
really short

1398
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,838
stubby leafs

1399
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,919
the afghani traits and those those would

1400
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,239
be the sweet plants that are in the

1401
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,559
bunch and they're they're actually

1402
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,279
really cool because

1403
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,960
you you get some of the sfv too and it

1404
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,680
kind of

1405
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,679
it kind of equates to like a almost like

1406
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:34,879
a piney

1407
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,960
like a piney cam you get i get tiny cams

1408
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,599
out of there too where there's you know

1409
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,480
it

1410
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,359
it it was really cool man uh you know i

1411
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,358
really wish i would have made more

1412
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,920
more seeds of it but i you know i had

1413
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:51,039
two females out of the packs

1414
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,559
and they both mattered late and it just

1415
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,440
it's just

1416
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,160
that the late flowering manners are so

1417
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,920
just unappealing to me man yeah

1418
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:02,078
they can ruin whole [ __ ] crops and a

1419
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,200
bunch of preemie seed that [ __ ] sucks

1420
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,839
yeah it's just you know just just just

1421
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,838
looking at it you know i just you know i

1422
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:11,920
hey i love some candies you know but

1423
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,239
don't get me wrong i i've seen that you

1424
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,240
know nine or late or whatever but

1425
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,959
you know compared to back in the day

1426
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:21,598
when we had some uh i remember mike had

1427
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,480
this apollo 13 from sub cool

1428
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,400
and

1429
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,400
this thing

1430
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,720
threw down you know

1431
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,200
would throw down a pound of plant easily

1432
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:34,558
by itself in a five gallon pot you know

1433
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,798
with just pro mix in it and uh

1434
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,519
it would be covered top to bottom and

1435
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:42,318
freaking little sterile manners and it

1436
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:44,559
was just like oh my god

1437
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:47,599

1438
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,519
it was terrible all that you know i

1439
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,280

1443
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,160
complaint from everyone was all the

1472
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:11,119
we're stupid friends because i've seen

1473
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,719
what looks like males appear from pure

1474
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,160
s1 lines where i know they weren't

1475
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:15,598
contaminated

1476
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,519
in the end

1477
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,880
what what we kind of came to the

1478
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,920
conclusion of

1479
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,760
when these things were tested sex tested

1480
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,639
they would test females but they were

1481
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,640
expressing all male

1482
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,199
it's a rare occurrence

1483
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,279
but it definitely can happen you know i

1484
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:36,399
know what you're saying you know i i

1485
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:40,240
i've read about it i haven't really got

1486
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,760
to see it yet yeah but yes i i have

1487
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,000
heard of them

1488
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,240
expressing or you know masking or

1489
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,838
whatnot yeah it's with with with

1490
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,719
cannabis plants like it's really easy to

1491
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,798
see with with uh reversal spray because

1492
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,118
i mean you could you could

1493
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,280
reverse a femme line that is most that

1494
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,280
is all female reverse it and make it

1495
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,960
turn male so manipulating any kind of

1496
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,559
hormones can make something express a

1497
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,199
hundred percent male even if there's not

1498
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:08,720
male chromosomes if that makes sense

1499
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:11,439
yes yes yeah now now it's a trip

1500
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:14,480
now how could i get true males

1501
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,000
from across to the white then if i if i

1502
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,280
i crossed that

1503
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that bubba ogres yeah

1504
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,798
and then those offspring

1505
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,559
had males in them yeah i mean it it

1506
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,358
shouldn't be more than maybe one or two

1507
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,200
males per 100 um

1508
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,199
but it would just be

1509
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,558
females expressing male as opposed to

1510
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,399
just being

1511
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,240
genetically male it would just look like

1512
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,440
males but genetically they're female if

1513
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,919
that makes sense

1514
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,559
cannabis is a weird [ __ ] plant and

1515
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,400
and a lot of times people put like human

1516
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,240
like think about human type genetics on

1517
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,039
it like where things are definitely male

1518
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,879
definitely female etc you can have

1519
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,119
something with all like all female

1520
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,680
chromosomes express male which is it's

1521
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,599
rare but it happens and it can happen

1522
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,118
for thousands of different reasons you

1523
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,039
know

1524
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,480
and they can follow

1525
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,920
now

1526
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,280
long term though will will progeny of

1527
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,920
that

1528
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,519
false male

1529
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,599
contain males

1530
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,639
yes usually what for some for whatever

1531
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,000
reason yes yeah and and the longer it's

1532
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:21,039
worked back

1533
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
it will

1534
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,759
slowly gain more males in its population

1535
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,440
yeah and that that's that's that's the

1536
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,079
other hard part that we've never figured

1537
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,039
out scientifically why that happens

1538
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,720
right it's been the longest process like

1539
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,838
just from when i first started reversing

1540
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,838
plants and noticed that males were

1541
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,679
popping up and of course people are like

1542
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,759
no no no pollen contamination i'm like

1543
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,199
but this is like one in a thousand how

1544
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,599
am i getting one into that well pollen

1545
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,439
contamination you know so i fought it

1546
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,599
for a long time trying to figure it out

1547
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,200
tighten up rooms figure it out and it is

1548
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,318
complicated it's way more complicated

1549
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,719
than just exactly but but

1550
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:59,920
most of the people who sell packs

1551
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:01,759
that are like half male half female and

1552
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,200
from a reverse pack that that's pawn

1553
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,280
contamination

1554
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,480
yeah i've done it myself on accident

1555
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,720
thinking that i knew what i was talking

1556
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,440
about and uh sold paul and contamination

1557
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:10,879
but

1558
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,880
oddly enough it looked like both the

1559
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,400
parents which always [ __ ] me up you

1560
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,358
know

1561
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,798
yeah

1562
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:21,279
yeah it was crazy man i i ran through a

1563
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:23,519
ton of those mr white

1564
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:27,200
um a few you know

1565
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:31,519
a few runs of the blackberry bubba ogres

1566
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:35,118
um you know it's hard to get any kind of

1567
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:38,239
scientific evaluation or anything using

1568
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,240
cookies in anything

1569
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,838
yeah i bet

1570
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,559
yeah right i couldn't you know give any

1571
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:47,599
good info on that but yeah it was really

1572
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,839
bizarre seeing seeing males and and like

1573
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,039
i said you know chopping it up with with

1574
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,759
uh

1575
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:56,079
with caleb and just you know just

1576
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,400
walking away stupider than i was you

1577
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,039
know before the conversation

1578
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,039
you didn't have

1579
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,760
yeah

1580
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,200
you know so

1581
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,000
yeah man that was that was about 2013

1582
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,159
man

1583
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,280
i would love to go back into those i do

1584
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:15,519
have some mystery like ultimate

1585
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,160
oh sorry i'm picking lee

1586
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:20,559
so mr white's ultimate kid i think i

1587
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:22,159
still have mr white to

1588
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,839
the white

1589
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,399
uh that's cool

1590
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,719
yeah yeah a few of them you know

1591
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,559
they didn't get every pack but i'd be

1592
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,480
damned you know there there were certain

1593
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:36,400
breeders they just liked the packaging

1594
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,559
on uh green team they loved his labels

1595
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,440
but they didn't eat any of the packs so

1596
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,400
it's like i had like 10 tore up dream

1597
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,400
team packs and then you know they didn't

1598
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,519
get into the seed containers at all it's

1599
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,200
like oh nice you know there's

1600
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,960
there's a hundred seats down the drain

1601
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,318
you know

1602
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,280
so

1603
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,279
yeah

1604
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,200
that's a it was a rough one

1605
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,040
so where are you at now what what what's

1606
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,199
your newest muse are you just kind of

1607
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,719
like you said stuck on um

1608
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:09,199
writer's block

1609
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:12,159
i'm uh i'm back into these uh

1610
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:15,679
i have a towering inferno i made with

1611
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:16,639
the uh norcal fire og the ultimate sfp

1612
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,879
cam

1613
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:21,679
uh

1614
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:25,280
i have made f2s

1615
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:28,480
released a few packs i made f3s

1616
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,720
but uh just a just a small just you know

1617
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,880
you know personal pack type of thing and

1618
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,439
i'm i'm going through those and i would

1619
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,880
like to make the next gen of those and

1620
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,119
uh

1621
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,680
you know i'm down to like these you know

1622
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,720
like i said in those ultimate sfv chems

1623
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,919
uh

1624
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:48,159
that you know about one and uh i'd say

1625
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,639
two and ten

1626
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:53,440
i'm getting these uh these short little

1627
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,719
appy plants and and you know the rest of

1628
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,519
the population is is a really you know

1629
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,558
stretchy camog headband plant you know

1630
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:02,559
yeah

1631
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,200
they grow fast they grow vigorous they

1632
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,559
grow you know straight up and as long as

1633
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:09,759
you know you clean the bottoms you just

1634
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:12,000
keep pushing and you look next to it and

1635
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,000

01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,119
something so

1677
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:52,400

him to both

1681
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:58,959

this

1683
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,000

1687
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,679
have two cam white chem lines and you

1688
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,920

you find in these these two lines here i

1690

uh

1704
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:49,279
you know just just trying to just keep

1705
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,920
furthering the lines you know i mean

1706
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,200
yeah i don't want to go too overboard

1707
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,358
and and

1708
01:04:53,199 --> 01:05:00,239
you know like that you know working that

1709
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:04,558
sour larry from you know bx1 bx2 bx2

1710
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:07,679
f2 bx2 ix you know it was

1711
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,920
this is a lot of [ __ ] time and i i

1712
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:11,679
get why guys don't want to

1713
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,838
you know you know they want to keep it

1714
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,159
moving and keep different flavors coming

1715
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:17,838
in and whatnot because i mean dude

1716
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,719
that's a pain in the ass not every

1717
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,480
plant's a [ __ ] rainbow man and yeah

1718
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,798
a lot of times you know especially in

1719
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,440
the early days with it i mean it was it

1720
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,838
was like classic [ __ ] gold mining you

1721
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,000
know you were you were [ __ ] sifting

1722
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,599
through rocks to find gold nuggets more

1723
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,318
so than you know

1724
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,480
you know now you know i think everybody

1725
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,480
has stepped their game up and

1726
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,079
you know they're there's a lot of good

1727
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,240
good strains out there you know where

1728
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,440
guys are pulling good numbers five out

1729
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,838
of you know

1730
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,559
five out of 10 females or whatever you

1731
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,960
know approved and you know people are

1732
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,440
finding keepers and whatnot not

1733
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,000
not long-term keepers i'm noticing yeah

1734
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,760
well i i think i think that the

1735
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,079
definition of keepers has changed so

1736
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,960
much

1737
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,640
that

1738
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,079
i don't know that they're finding

1739
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,358
keepers that we would have considered

1740
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,079
back in the day

1741
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:12,480
but they are instagram appropriate and

1742
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:15,440
more resinous therefore

1743
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,639
they're easier to label keepers if that

1744
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,639
makes sense

1745
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,639
oh yeah yeah cause it's not the keepers

1746
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,558
are chosen on instagram by pictures not

1747
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,719
necessarily by by the quality of the

1748
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,200
smoke the complexion yeah

1749
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:28,399
yeah exactly

1750
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,149
dude

1751
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:36,000
give me green weed any day

1752
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:36,000
[Laughter]

1753
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:41,038
you know i mean i liked animal cookies i

1754
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,960
thought for a cookies cross that was

1755
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,920
that was a good one you know i've had a

1756
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,119
few

1757
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,480
but for the most part man that i i still

1758
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:53,119
like anything free cookies you know what

1759
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,679

1760
01:06:53,119 --> 01:07:00,640
it too hard but you know we smoked a lot

1761
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:02,480
of northern lights here you know yeah

1762
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,838

1763
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,760
one i i

1764
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,599
wouldn't care if i ever saw it again

1765
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,400

1771
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:25,358
the fall you know this was around

1772
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,599
[ __ ] late 90s man you're either smoking

1773
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,279
you're either smoking lights for your

1774
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,798
smoking you know that we call the

1775
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,160
canadian bacon

1776
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:36,318
and we could still get the uh every fall

1777
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:39,118
from you know cali we get the christmas

1778
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:41,679
bud up here you know yeah and only in

1779
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,280
small amounts you know and we literally

1780
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,358
just knew somebody that brought enough

1781
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,680
to take care of like 10 friends you know

1782
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,440
and it you you put your order in on like

1783
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:52,000
the fourth of july and you know had your

1784
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,720
fingers crossed you know yeah but uh

1785
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,039
yeah it's it's changed you know these

1786
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,959
you know it used to be hard to get cuts

1787
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,280
and seeds and

1788
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,880
[ __ ] you know it's it's a whole new

1789
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,319
world you know

ballpark for all of us yeah dude

1791
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,239
but uh i still believe there's plenty of

1792
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,558
[ __ ] you know legendary giants and

1793

all those old seeds man and

1794
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,838

1795
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,719

1796
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:20,719
you know

1797
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,119
work on resurrecting something that you
