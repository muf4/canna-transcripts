90
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,560
brand myself until

91
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,679
god almost like 2014 2015 and that was

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
when i

93
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,519
got online and started talking to people

94
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,359
and i realized i needed a name and

95
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,959
i was trying to get into the cannabis

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,359
industry and

97
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,439
so yeah i came up with hbk that was

98
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,000
actually a name that came

99
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,160
prior when i was playing paintball yeah

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
back in the day actually kind of before

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,600
that and it was just for half-baked kids

102
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,280
is that what this dance floor

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
yeah that's funny i didn't know that

104
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,439
until right now

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
yeah i had a foreman at one point um and

106
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,759
he didn't really like me and

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
used to be like oh that stoner guy he's

108
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,919
[ __ ] half

109
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,758

110
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,639
i was playing paintball for about 10

111
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,439
years

112
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720

puffing back in san diego when you were

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,240
there

123
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,159
yeah so i grew up in east county um and

124
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,759
i think when i was in about 10th grade i

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
started smoking

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
what kind of stuff did you see around

127
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,198
then

128
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,560
uh brick weed yeah yeah the experience

129
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
of the brick weed

130
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
yeah and then every great once in a

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
while we would see some kind bud come

132
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
through and that was usually we'd have

133
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,478
to go down into like el cajon or maybe

134
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,879
like mission beach

135
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,319
track that down but that was so

136
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,360
expensive back then that i couldn't like

137
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,038
that's why i started growing yeah my my

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
dad was a grower

139
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,918
he was kind of a hobbyist grower when i

140
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,280
was a kid

141
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,120
and his

142
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,519
best friend who lived on our property

143
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,639
was like legit grower he was a gorilla

144
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,599
grower yeah and so when i started

145
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,439
growing my dad kind of shut me down real

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
quick but then daryl my dad's best

147
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,038
friend took me under his wing

148
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
and then there were some other people in

149
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,318
our town that were pretty heavy growers

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
and

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,360
so yeah i learned pretty early on that

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,520
would have been like 89

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,439
88.89 i started growing yeah and in 1991

154
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,519
i was already producing speeds because

155
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,399
back then we couldn't find any seeds

156
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,560
yeah

157
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,038
i got lucky and had some pretty good

158
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,839
strains and was already finding some

159
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,159
males and so i started making seed

160
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,799
and i had a um

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,120
growing up on the border in tecate

162
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,160
i grew up with kids that parents were

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,120
cartel growers yeah and they were like

164
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,720
can you get a seed like bags of seed and

165
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,519
i was like well yeah and so i

166
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
realized that it was easier to grow seed

167
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,680
for sale

168
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,240
and not risk as much than trying to grow

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,160
pounds yeah and so that's what i started

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,519
doing early on but then

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
um

172
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,639
i took a break from like 97

173
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,959
98 to

174
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,400
2004 or 5.

175
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,879
i had a daughter

176
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,318
and my life changed and

177
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,839
kind of got out of it for a little while

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,240
and then came back

179
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,918
and been here ever since

180
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,680
yeah so when you um when i first met you

181
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,680
you were heavy heavy heavy into the

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
topical scene and

183
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439
i remember like our first exchange uh

184
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,679
you gave me some of your cream like hey

185
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,519
try it out like real generous it was i

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
knew it it sold for good money but you

187
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,120
gave it to me that's right

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,079
and i've tried so many different creams

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,319
over the years and i i really genuinely

190
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,399
dismissed every cream that i tried after

191
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,720
that but when i tried yours and handed

192
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,679
it off to my chick and my my mom at the

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
time they were blown away absolutely

194
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,400
blown away and you started winning some

195
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,399
big awards for your work um can you tell

196
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,000
us how you got into that i'm very

197
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,359
interested in that

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,360
yes so my daughter when she was born um

199
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,160
she was born with a rare skin condition

200
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
called epidermolysis bullosa

201
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
um

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
it's like

203
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,160
so they're missing a skin tissue layer

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,598
and

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
it's called the butterfly disease i

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,240
think is what they call it or something

207
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,478
like that and it's kind of like

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,519
being burned every day

209
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,478
without being burned and so blisters

210
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,120
sores the blisters once they start they

211
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,038
don't stop they just keep like she would

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
get a little blister on her knuckle and

213
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,918
by the next morning it would take up her

214
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,000
whole hand oh god and you'd have to stop

215
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,240
you'd have to lance it to stop it but

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,200
you're not supposed to do but yeah

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,000
because of the tissue layer issue

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,879
um she would get these infections so in

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,879
96 95 96

220
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,080
there were some local

221
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,879
hippies um a lady named marion who was

222
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,519
uh one of my elementary teachers and her

223
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,639
husband were holistic

224
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,600
old-school hippie growers at that time

225
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,439
and

226
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
she was like oh you know you got to make

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,440
these cannabis sad

228
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
and you start teaching me about cannabis

229
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
salves and creams

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
and then

231
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,759
god i

232
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,120
kind of dabbled around with it for a

233
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,159
little bit but then when i came back

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
into

235
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,759
to growing again i started trying to

236
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
pick it up but

237
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,879
i wasn't getting the effects that i

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
really wanted it wasn't really working

239
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,439
for her

240
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,278
but then

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,880
i came across cbd and him and working

242
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,639
with ringo lawrence

243
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,879
and he was like hey you know we got this

244
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,639
stuff you should check it out i've got a

245
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,159
friend that's making these creams and

246
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,879
it's really helping

247
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,519
and i was like oh okay and so i got into

248
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,838
it

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,080
and yeah i just decided i'm gonna make a

250
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,360
good cream you know like i wanted

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
something that because with my

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,278
daughter's skin condition

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
it couldn't be too greasy it couldn't

254
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,958
get oily

255
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,799
and it couldn't be too rough

256
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,879
so a lot of the people that were making

257
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,039
cannabis sods or bombs it was like

258
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,039
beeswax and

259
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,078
coconut oil and

260
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,078
gonzo and that just made her skin

261
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,599
problem worse so i came up with the

262
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,000
cocoa cream

263
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,159
with seven ingredients and it started

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
working for her and so i started kind of

265
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,000
selling it on the side a little bit yeah

266
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
i started getting instant feedback

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
everybody's like dude this is amazing

268
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
and so yeah i started getting it on the

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,919
market and i started winning awards

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,720
and then

271
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,360
um the cbd craze hit

272
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,920
yeah and all of a sudden it went from

273
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,680
like 10 or 20 of us that were making cbd

274
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:40,000
creams or topicals to like thousands

275
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,639
and big companies that were like dumping

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,039
[ __ ] on the market and garbage yeah all

277
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,199
of a sudden i went from everybody being

278
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,879
like oh wow who are you what's this too

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
all of a sudden everybody's like oh

280
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,799
you're a cbd company [ __ ] you

281
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,239
yeah

282
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,319
for a while

283
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,720
and i kind of just

284
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,000
kept it available for people who wanted

285
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,399
it needed it but i stopped trying to go

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
big with it because um

287
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,240
i didn't have a million dollars to go up

288
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,519
against these cbd companies that started

289
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,919
coming out

290
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,440
and so yeah i still make it i still have

291
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,838
it available um yeah so yeah i just

292
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,120
don't i just don't market it like i used

293
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
to because

294
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
it's just the people who know know and

295
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
and

296
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,838
anybody that wants to know it's still

297
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,399
there

298
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,399
that's good to know i mean like it's

299
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,559
people don't understand like with that

300
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,039
market there was only a few people that

301
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,759
were doing it right like really right

302
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,000
and when cbd hit big and and the farm

303
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,600
bill passed and [ __ ] like people started

304
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,399
licensing

305
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,278
uh

306
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,278
hemp products from from china that would

307
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,360
and they grow they are paid to grow hemp

308
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,759
over there to leech toxins from the soil

309
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,800
like it's used to do that it's garbage

310
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,360
and

311
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,599
they know they can pass that out off at

312
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
cheaply super cheap on dumb ass

313
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
americans

314
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,560
and that pretty much wrecked the whole

315
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,559
industry for the few people who were

316
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,159
doing this [ __ ] right and now you see it

317
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,679
in gas stations everywhere you don't

318
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,439
know how it's sourced you don't know how

319
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,039
it's made and there's no regulation so

320
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,160
nobody gets a [ __ ]

321
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,278
it's it's sad that's sad

322
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,519
it's one of those things that people

323
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,519
don't seem to know very much about so

324
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,039
when i went fully legal it seems to me

325
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
like all those products you were talking

326
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,879
about most of them don't have like the

327
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,399
amount you would want

328
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:31,039
right they just want to splash cbd

329
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,600
cream or lip balm or this or that or

330
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,278
whatever or gels and they don't really

331
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
have a bunch of science behind what

332
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,200
actually works what i was thinking when

333
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,919
you were talking about all that stuff is

334
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,560
like how interesting like your

335
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,958
weed path is because most people

336
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,759
who start making seeds have been growing

337
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,439
flower for a while before they get like

338
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,399
the know-how and the knowledge and the

339
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,360
itch

340
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,958
to make you know to like sell seed not

341
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,278
to like make seed every year to grow

342
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,559
flour but actually to like sell seed

343
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,240
right and then to get into cream cream

344
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,559
has got to be one of the rarest things

345
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,879
that anybody ever figured out how to do

346
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,759
like that like like pretty much nobody

347
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,360
was

348
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,360
nobody was really making that kind of

349
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,039
stuff it wasn't common

350
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
i never met anyone

351
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,679
really it was like

352
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,919
and

353
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,838
because i was dedicated to making seed i

354
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,479
didn't have a lot of flour so i have a

355
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
lot of by-product from the plant that i

356
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,680
was breaking down for the seed and i'm

357
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
like what am i going to do with this

358
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,120
let's make hash or let's like let's

359
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,278

chapstick

407
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,879
dude that the chapsticks were like a big

408
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
thing for a long time when i was doing

409
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,720
the emerald cup yeah

410
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,879
sell out i would go through like 500

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
containers and every year people would

412
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,480
go back over the booth and pull their

413
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
their stick out and be like oh this is

414
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,399
the best i still got it i'm glad you're

415
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,838
here yeah

416
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,879
i think it's because it's like super

417
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,320
it's affordable and it's it's something

418
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,559
everybody can afford but it's highly

419
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,879
effective at the same time

420
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,479
i know

421
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,799
so people are going to want me to ask

422
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
more about ringo and your interactions i

423
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,479
didn't know ringo so i didn't have any

424
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,320
interactions with him or his crew can

425
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,759
you talk about him a little bit

426
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,759
yeah so i knew rango kind of um

427
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
i would go up and see him every once in

428
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,560
a while we had kind of like a phone

429
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,879

445
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
we kind of took a bond and he's like hey

446
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,439
you know i got some work

447
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,039

and i'm like okay

449
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,000
and so yeah i started talking with him

450
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:43,838
and

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
kind of formed a bond and i would just

452
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,759
call him and go and see him every now

453
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,959
and then and then when the cbd thing hit

454
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,759
for him

455
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,679
he was kind of like the godfather of the

456
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,959
cbd

457
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,679
um

458
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,599
and then he got sick and passed away

459
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,599
before i could really get a chance to

460
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
spend a lot of time with him

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,558
um

462
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,919
we were doing a little bit of cbd

463
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,918
breeding work when i was doing all that

464
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
testing for [ __ ] with the well i wasn't

465
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,679
really doing testing for hymen i got a

466
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,400
lot of the early cantatonic seeds yeah

467
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,360
yeah

468
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,079
stuff

469
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,119
and then when ringo had all his sioux

470
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,519
lines

471
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,879
i started going through those and

472
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,639
um

473
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
and then we started working on the

474
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,839
lavender project and then yeah he passed

475
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,080
away

476
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,399
and i tried to reach out to his kids but

477
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,639
his kids didn't really know me and they

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,840
were doing their own thing and so yeah i

479
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,480
just kind of lost track of all that and

480
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,279
unfortunately i'm not sure

481
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,640
if any of his lines are still around

482
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,480
from the family if they're still

483
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
focusing on any of that or not i

484
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,200
honestly don't know

485
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
yeah

486
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,880
his daughter danielle

487
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
and levi were the ones that kind of took

488
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,679
over and i think they still have some

489
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,798
stuff going on but i'm not sure but i

490
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,640
still see harold sue crosses everywhere

491
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,200
oh yeah yeah

492
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,038
so that's that's his legacy that'll live

493
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,120
on forever

494
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,720
yeah that's cool when you get to to work

495
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,439
with some of those guys who are maybe

496
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,079
like

497
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,240
underground like legends like that you

498
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,319
know you get to just briefly rub elbows

499
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,240
with them and have some of their magic

500
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,079
rub off on you a little bit that's

501
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,919
that's special stuff and it sounds like

502
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,079
he's a special dude

503
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,720
yeah yeah he was the one that got me to

504
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,119
like start growing again um

505
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,679
i was still kind of like oh i'll grow a

506
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,000
couple little plants in my backyard

507
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,919
and he was like no man you know like

508
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
you live in a great area

509
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,640
you can go incognito like let's do this

510
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
and i'm like okay yeah okay let's do

511
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
this

512
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,880
and so yeah i miss that guy he was

513
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,640
he was really cool he had a lot of

514
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,120
great stuff going on he grew a lot of

515
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,080
really big plants and yeah i missed him

516
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,558
so

517
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,558
well that's cool you have anything you

518
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,119
want to ask nathan

519
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,879
i mean the the weird i do i was just

520
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,319
thinking about like the whole

521
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,320
the whole cbd thing because i think like

522
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,480
for the probably the first 20 or for

523
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,519
most people when they first encountered

524
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,599
cbd

525
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,279
like they didn't know what it was and so

526
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,199
they felt like it didn't work like i

527
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,279
come from the midwest right and we used

528
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,679
to get really beautiful ditchweed

529
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,720
sometimes we'd call it pretendica and it

530
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,080
would look like unbelievably juicy so

531
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,720
much better you were talking about

532
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,159
mexican we all started on you know there

533
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
was two kinds of weed there was brown

534
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,440
mexican and green mexican

535
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
and then every once in a while you'd

536
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,038
find kind bud but then sometimes people

537
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,038
would take that that gorgeous weed and

538
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,640
dry it and it would look so amazing and

539
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,160
we'd spend all this money and we'd smoke

540
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,400
and smoke and smoke and smoke and like

541
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,720
oh i'm like man i'm not getting high

542
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,720
you know and so it's interesting it's

543
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,798
just interesting how like

544
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,120
how for a long time we had like this

545
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,400
relationship with hemp and cbd and then

546
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:01,359
we went like 50 60 years with nothing

547
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,600
and so even a lot of even a lot of like

548
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,519
you know like people on the thc side

549
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,719
that are pretty knowledgeable like

550
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,960
you know

551
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,839
t cbd is supposed to do you know stuff

552
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,000
everything from like miracle cures to

553
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,439
like make nothing

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,679
yeah right like

555
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,120
it's really odd in that regard you know

556
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,038
and so

557
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,479
you know it's kind of like in its i

558
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,000
think it's kind of like in its infancy

559
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,159
and it seems like it got all big all

560
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,919
quick like you were saying and so all

561
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,960
these sharks jumped in

562
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,038
and kind of like diluted the scene

563
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,798
is really realised you know just well

564
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,558
yeah everyone just jumped in and nobody

565
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,480
knew anything and then you get to sell

566
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,158
something cool and holistic to people

567
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,839
that don't know anything and they don't

568
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
know how much doses are supposed to be

569
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,240
in there

570
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,679
yeah they don't know what an effective

571
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,798
dose is

572
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,960
right and so it's kind of like yeah it's

573
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,839
weird it's it's weird and that like it

574
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,319
as soon as it went legal it like got

575
00:20:53,839 --> 00:21:00,558
doused in a sea of like ineffective cbd

576
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,759
yeah the difference between the textile

577
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,798
hemp style plants that are more for

578
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,440
fiber

579
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:11,200
which is also carries some cbd

580
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,360
which is hemp versus the more

581
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,759
traditional like cbd lines that we know

582
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,199
now like catatonic there was a big

583
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,679
difference

584
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,319
um so when i first started smoking some

585
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,320
of the early con pentatonic i picked up

586
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,759
on on a euphoric feeling from it and i

587
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,839
was like oh yeah okay there's something

588
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,079
here and then when we made the creams

589
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,759
for it i made some really hot batches

590
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,798
and i could feel my hands get numb and i

591
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,640
was like oh wow okay

592
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,918
you know yeah

593
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
i've gotten i've gotten textiles type

594
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
hemp

595
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,038
extraction and tried to use it and it's

596
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,558
completely useless because you know

597
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,960
what's interesting about that is like

598
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,158
catatonic and stuff it seems like

599
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,120
there's a there's not that much cbd

600
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,440
that's like bred from drug cultivars

601
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,719
towards the cbd side and that's kind of

602
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
what i was getting on what you were

603
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,839
saying is like cantatonic was sort of

604
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,279
bred from

605
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,158
smoking weed

606
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,319
not from the other side of like hemp

607
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,280
fiber or anything like that which might

608
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:13,200
have a bunch in it but if you remember

609
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,359
when jaime first sent those tester seeds

610
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,120
out like we didn't know it was a cbd

611
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,719
line it was just catatonic and they just

612
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,959
made the cry it wasn't ever advertised

613
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,200
they didn't breed it as a cbd line

614
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,240
originally it just ended up that way

615
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,480
yeah yeah and if you look at the

616
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,558
genetics behind catatonic you would

617
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,839
think oh this is going to be some fire

618
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,240
weed like

619
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,240
thc weed because it's

620
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,558
the genetics behind it but then yeah

621
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,279
it's primarily

622
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,798
cbd only now when i was going through

623
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,399
all those packs and i was having them

624
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:47,519
tested i found one pheno that was a

625
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,640
primarily thc carrier pheno it was like

626
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,519
a 14 or 16 percent thc

627
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,159
with very little thc or cbd yeah that

628
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,839
was still one of my favorite plants that

629
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,559
i ever smoked it was like real cheesy

630
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,480
and it got me so high and then when i

631
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,879
was doing that work with plant speaker

632
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,000
jay i lost that cut i was trying to get

633
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,840
it to jay and while i was gone up there

634
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,679
i lost that cut and

635
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,798
but there are

636
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,159
some very rare thc phenos of cantatonic

637
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:19,759
out there yeah

638
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,280
yeah i just i think it's funny because a

639
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,839
lot of people weren't around when resin

640
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,798
seeds came out and all their i remember

641
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,240
they had the the fake hp 13 sour diesel

642
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,240
so i remember thinking [ __ ] they got the

643
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
sour [ __ ] and they're selling it hell

644
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,279
yeah i want to try that and it turned

645
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,880
out not to be anything and they admitted

646
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,558
it later on they're like yeah this isn't

647
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,600
what we thought it was which is cool of

648
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,359
them um yeah we have a catatonic i

649
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,359
remember remember when that came out too

650
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,319
and it was not a cbd like it was like

651
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:49,199
what mk ultra g13 haze

652
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,519
yep yeah there was probably honestly in

653
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,919
the in the prohibition days there was

654
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,798
probably an enormous amount of cbd

655
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,720
in

656
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,480
uh various cannabis strains that got

657
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,319
selected away from

658
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,000
because we weren't we were only testing

659
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,599
by smoking

660
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,038
and so you you know you're passing

661
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,319
around different phenotypes and your

662
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,640
friends are like no that one i don't

663
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,399
think let's go with this one yeah you

664
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,440
know because without testing it's really

665
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,600
hard like something that's one to one

666
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,360
you know like 10 12 thc and 10 12 like

667
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,480
cbd or something that's high in that

668
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,639
like without

669
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,679
you know i mean when was the first time

670
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,120
you saw results like actual testing when

671
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,360
do you remember

672
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:33,439
oh that would have been 2011.

673
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,199
i was just gonna say like 11 12

674
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,600
somewhere in there so basically what you

675
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,919
guys are saying is that we've had

676
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,319
testing for a little longer than a

677
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,720
decade

678
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,038
right where it's like before that like

679
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,558
we really weren't able to select for cbd

680
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,359
very well

681
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,278
no and once i got my first few tests

682
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,278
that came back i was hooked on getting

683
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,558
tests remember matt i was just like

684
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:01,359
every week i was testing testing testing

685
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,879
all my money it was so [ __ ] expensive

686
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,479
back then too and i remember every time

687
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,320
i'm like how does he [ __ ] afford to

688
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
test all this [ __ ] i can't test one

689
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,759
thing and he's got like [ __ ] 20. yeah

690
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,918
i was doing literally like between two

691
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,759
and five thousand dollars every other

692
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,520
week on testing just trying to go

693
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,519
through all these and that's why i

694
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,519
gained a lot of respect early on because

695
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,240
i was actually doing the work to find

696
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,558
these these cultivars yeah you for sure

697
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,319
were you were doing real testing

698
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,038
at a time when it was totally just not

699
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,960
advantageous financially to do it and it

700
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,640
was it was very very cool it was very

701
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,319
cool to watch and luckily you used some

702
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,559
of my [ __ ] so i was like yeah i can see

703
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:42,918
the tesla's on my [ __ ] too because i'm

704
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,918
cheap i'm cheap fellas

705
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,399
so let's let's uh talk about some of

706
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,519
these um strains you've seen over the

707
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,120
years some of the ones you've worked

708
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,480
with let's start from the beginning what

709
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,959
was one of some of the first strains you

710
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,360
were crossing at hbk

711
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,360
um at hpk or the first strings i was

712
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,558
crossing let's say first you mentioned

713
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,639
that you were crossing like different

714
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,038
mexicans right at the beginning

715
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,720
yeah i was doing just like like the very

716
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,879
first stuff was just like some regular

717
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,759
old brick weed seed and

718
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,159
um

719
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,400
there was some a guy in pine valley that

720
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,000
i was growing up with named chris balman

721
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,880
and he was

722
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
like

723
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
going out and finding all the kind bud

724
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,720
he was a truck fun kid and he had the

725
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,798
money and he was bringing all this weed

726
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,640
back and he was getting really good bad

727
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,879
feet he was collecting it and he was

728
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,799
giving me some of that and i was popping

729
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,278
those and out of those i had gotten this

730
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,798

00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,400
buddies in the area and campo there were

733
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,159
like damn like that's bomb yeah and then

734
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,440
one of our our friends in the

735
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,120
neighborhood

736
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,679
that hippie couple

737
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,558
they traveled to amsterdam met up with

738
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,960
neville

739
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,319
brought back most of his seed bank and

740
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,240
this was in

741
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,439
i want to say

742
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,359
my daughter

743
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
wasn't born yet so it would have been

744
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,359
394

745
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,840
they brought back a bunch of genetics

746
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,558
and my best friend jeff at the time was

747
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,639
working with his people and he pulled a

748
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,720
few cuts away from them and then got a

749
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,320
few seeds from them after they had made

750
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,079
some crosses

751
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,599
and that's what i was working with and

752
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,359
then there was another guy over in

753
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,199
verona

754
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,959
by the indian reservation they were

755
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,440
working with some jamaicans

756
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,360
yeah jamaican lions and we got a little

757
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,200
bit of that and that's what i was

758
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,558
working with early on

759
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,759
and

760
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,918
then

761
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,038
when my

762
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,679
wife at the time got busted for

763
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,599
international trafficking we lost

764
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,038
everything we moved and then i had to

765
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,119
start over again

766
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,879
in mid-2000

767
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,359
and in mid-2000

768
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,278
when you started working with making uh

769
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,479
strings again what were you what were

770
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:53,919
you growing

771
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,599
what were some of your selection

772
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,759
criteria

773
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,519
the first few things i started working

774
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,879
with was i was moving some weight for

775
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,519
some um mom growers in your valley and i

776
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,960
got some heated pounds of some really

777
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,398
great wheat

778
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,440
and

779
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,439
i then got some bag seed from some kids

780
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,320
that i was playing paintball with

781
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,360
and that's when i was making that candy

782
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:22,240
candy crack was what i was calling it

783
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,879
and i ran that for a long time

784
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,038
for a few years and then i got into the

785
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
cbd thing hard

786
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,558
i was running some of your stuff and um

787
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
people been asking about that candy

788
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,319
crack green in the in the comments

789
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,159
repeatedly

790
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,000
yeah

791
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,240
that was something that

792
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,960
is kind of this convoluted [ __ ] up

793
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,278
story that i i got tired of arguing with

794
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,558
everybody about you know i made that

795
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,398
stuff back in like 2005 or six i was

796
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,240
dumping clones

797
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,678
just some kids in san jose that were

798
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,798
distributing them

799
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,640
and

800
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:59,599
i didn't realize

801
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
like

802
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,839
what it really was until about 2014

803
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,120
when i started seeing some of the

804
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,480
flowers come back and everybody's like

805
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,879
yeah it's crap

806
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,679
and i'm like man i think that's my

807
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,679
stream you know so i reached out to you

808
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,798
yeah and so it kind of came up with the

809
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,320
name and

810
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,319
then later on god like

811
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,480
2018 or 1911

812
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,000
started by losing everything and so i

813
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,120
threw in a philos

814
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,759
run and it came back as green ribbon but

815
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,798
also green crack it was also related to

816
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,759
skunk

817
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,720
hemp

818
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,960
colombian gold dream queen

819
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,679
yeah all this [ __ ] so

820
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,880
i don't [ __ ] know like i honestly

821
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,320
don't know i just kind of was like

822
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,120
whatever

823
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,558
like

824
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,278
if if

825
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,720
if it is it is cool you know like i knew

826
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,119
i had some really good stuff but it was

827
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,200
such a small run and i wasn't really

828
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,599
shooting for anything at that point but

829
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,798
it turned out to be a [ __ ] and strain

830
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,678
um

831
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,519
and yeah there's it it violences back to

832
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,480
a bunch of stuff so

833
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,599
you know

834
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,038
whether yeah

835
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,119
it's a tough one you never know like

836
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,038
their their results were so

837
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,319
inconsistent like some of the times i'd

838
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,079
see him and be like okay that makes

839
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,720
sense genetically this related to that

840
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,199
blah blah blah and then you go and see

841
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,558
like that that i don't know for example

842
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,319
um

843
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,839
let's say someone submitted a bubba

844
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,278
mendo perps and then they submitted

845
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,639
bubba and then they submitted mendo

846
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,319
perps that they made it with and then

847
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
all of a sudden it's like oh none of

848
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,558
these are related well that's right

849
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,200
weird you know yeah

850
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,960
right so yeah i kind of just stopped

851
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,960
arguing that point

852
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,519
but then the next thing that came up was

853
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,480
the chili birdie the chili verde was

854
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,879
part of the the lavender project with

855
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,558

scent like the san jose cut or whatever

862
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:04,319
it was the lavender that everybody had

863
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:07,039
in mid 2000 a little short stocky super

864
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,278

was doing that i had a whole depth full

883
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,480

892
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,278
um

893
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,480
what was the other one the craft baby it

894
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,319
was oh the

895
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,120
the green candy

896
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,038
and there was another one that i did

897
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,959
and

898
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,519
harvested all that stuff took all the

899
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,360
seeds back up to ringo came to him and

900
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,440
then he passed away

901
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,678
and then the next season

902
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,759
was a year when those kids ripped me off

903
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,200
and yes a lot of that

904
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:33,038
got all that breeder stock from me so i

905
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,960
lost the lavender stock basically i um

906
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,319
kept one little i had one little shitty

907
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,960
clone left

908
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,960
and but i had all the other seeds and

909
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,440
then i started dropping those chili

910
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,480
verdes and when i dropped the chili

911
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
birthday

912
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,360
i got kind of a lot of pushback people

913
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,038
were actually talking [ __ ] to me when i

914
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,398
dropped them and they were like you use

915
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,839
key lime pie

916
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,000
they're like that is the studious

917
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,319
[ __ ] plant in the world yeah you're

918
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,960
not a breeder and i'm like

919
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,720
well i liked it it was okay you know

920
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,558
none of them had even tried it that's

921
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,120
the [ __ ] far like it was it was in so

922
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,960
few hands at the time yeah

923
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,398
yeah and so

924
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,399
didn't i

925
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,839
kind of perceived it as oh well maybe i

926
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,479
made a mistake

927
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,839
and so i didn't really push it that hard

928
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,599
and i sold some packs and then um kind

929
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,678
of just set it aside

930
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,359
and she was like two years later two

931
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,720
years later it popped a few more seeds

932
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,599
and i had

933
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,519
um

934
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,240

and

957
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,440
that was when i met not so dog i think

958
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,440
at the same exact event

959
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,000
that's a nice cut i got to i agree that

960
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,359
cut that you gave him multiple years in

961
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,800
greenhouses

962
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,239
in mendocino

963
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,480
um it it

964
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,279
it was it was i liked it sun grown quite

965
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,719
a bit

966
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,519
was that was that the the super verde

967
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,519
cup

968
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,679
yeah yeah we we had this chili very i

969
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,519
have pictures of it on my phone uh we

970
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,760
had a bunch of them um we did probably

971
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,719
a couple years in a row probably half of

972
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,960
like a 30 by 100 greenhouse of it

973
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,638
there was one a good one

974
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,358
huh there was one when eric first

975
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,599
brought it up that smelled like to a tea

976
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,078
chili verde like just

977
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,680
the wildest greasy meat chili verde

978
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,560
smell yeah it does kind of seem to like

979
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:09,358
that weed came out like a few years

980
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,759
before the the like modern purple wave

981
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,598
sort of swamped everything yeah you know

982
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
it really was like purple had not been

983
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,079
popular for the most part for quite a

984
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,639
long time so

985
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,560
um you know it it was one of the first

986
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,960
cuts i remember seeing

987
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,039
that like you know kind of started that

988
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,119
way like that and the gelato and

989
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,400
different things like that like but it

990
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,160
reminded me

991
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,838
it definitely you can definitely taste

992
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,838
the lavender in it

993
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,159
yeah it's it's you know but i think it's

994
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,400
maybe a little bit more potent

995
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,239
so the cut that matt's referring to is

996
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,039
one of the other cuts that i had it was

997
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,838
more of that the straight chili now the

998
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,880
super chili which was coined by

999
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,480
um lion bolt i think which is the d cut

1000
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,400
that's the cut that i gave john the one

1001
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,800
that won the emerald cup that one was

1002
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,760
heavy lavender it was really gravy but

1003
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
it still had like this og overtone to it

1004
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,560
yeah

1005
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,880
it was really different than the the cut

1006
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,480
that i smelled from you it was

1007
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,599
like the one i smelled from using like

1008
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
meat like

1009
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,720
chili verde on the the barbecue it was

1010
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,320
good yeah the one i had was sweet so

1011
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,480
much sweeter

1012
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,240
you know the one the one that that won

1013
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,000
the emerald cup was the one the reason i

1014
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,319
gave it out was because it had better

1015
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,400
uniformity looking structure it had more

1016
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,359
tighter nugs and it was a little bit

1017
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,599
easier to run in depth or outdoor but it

1018
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,639
was really finicky indoors especially if

1019
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,920
you were running the old-school shitty

1020
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:38,159
leds the pink ones yeah it [ __ ] does

1021
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,800
not like those like chili just doesn't

1022
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,838
like leds for some reason i'm not sure

1023
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,039
why

1024
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,000
but

1025
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:48,000
um yeah so those were the two that i had

1026
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
a couple different cuts and then

1027
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,599
um

1028
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,280
john had the fire the cut got out got to

1029
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,000
a few different people and then yeah it

1030
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,720
took off and it won and

1031
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,440
i was a little bummed because i wasn't

1032
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,439
in position to be able to capitalize on

1033
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,480
getting cuts out to the population when

1034
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,119
it won yeah and all the other people

1035
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,838
instantly jumped on it and maybe oh sure

1036
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,880
made a lot of money yeah and i was just

1037
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,639
like hey

1038
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,400
[ __ ] you know

1039
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,440
how am i going to deal with this how do

1040
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,760
i

1041
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,400
how do i direct this in my direction

1042
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,640
yeah so i started dropping seeds like i

1043
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,440
got seeds i got seeds like i don't have

1044
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,799
cuts but i got seeds and so

1045
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,599
i kind of tried to stay on top of it

1046
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
and

1047
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,280
yeah still kind of

1048
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,200
pushing that run you know it's turned

1049
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,119
out to be a really good breeder

1050
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,239
um i've gotten up into the f5 f6s now oh

1051
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,200
awesome

1052
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,598
i got

1053
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:49,358
the last batch of chili crosses that i

1054
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,480
did i did like

1055
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,400
i think it was seven crosses with an f5

1056
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,400
and they turned out phenomenal every

1057
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,920
single jar you open is just so bomb

1058
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,000
[ __ ] in color

1059
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,039
because you get that red from the hairs

1060
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,159
and the purples and some of the greens

1061
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,159
um

1062
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,078
and i kind of did some hypey crosses a

1063
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,399
couple years ago before i went to work

1064
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,839
for emerald and i still haven't released

1065
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,240
them i'm trying to get them out in the

1066
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,279
next couple weeks but there was a brunch

1067
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,679
chili

1068
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,160
wedding crashers chili wedding cake

1069
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,759
chili josh d chili

1070
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,078
uh dosie dough chili and sweeties chili

1071
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,079
yeah and every one of them turned out

1072
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,359
just amazing i was really happy with

1073
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,359
every single one of them

1074
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,000
okay one of the things i like about the

1075
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,119
chili verde is that a lot of cookie

1076
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,838
hybrids

1077
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,358
uh seem to not like the sun and not like

1078
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,400
food very much

1079
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:49,039
you know like so there it i don't know i

1080
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,200
felt like that one especially like you

1081
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,199
put it out in the sun and it thrived

1082
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,358
you fed it well and it thrived like it

1083
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,598
could eat it could grow there's certain

1084
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,039
aspects where like you know i i think

1085
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,039
sometimes like some of these some of

1086
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,039
some cookie selections were designed for

1087
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,759
like rock woolen to be two feet tall in

1088
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,279
an indoor situation and like the chili

1089
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,760
verde can grow

1090
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,359
you know like it can be a healthy happy

1091
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,520
vigorous plant

1092
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,759
um and a lot of cookie hybrids aren't

1093
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,440
that way in my opinion you know that one

1094
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
was one that was you know you could put

1095
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,480
it in the sun and it would you know you

1096
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,039
could put it in a greenhouse you could

1097
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,440
dep it like you said it did well as like

1098
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,119
a medium-sized plant like something you

1099
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,760
want to get a half pound to a pound per

1100
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,400
plant off of and it gave you a lot of

1101
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,040
very very pretty weed like you were

1102
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,358
saying the formation on it it's

1103
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,759
extremely attractive when it's dry it

1104
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,679
has a really nice aroma

1105
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,160
you know and it gets me hot

1106
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,159
it um i always thought because of the

1107
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,199
lavender it wasn't going to be a big

1108
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,159
yielder

1109
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,279
but when i was working for ben

1110
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:56,639
um up in mendo we ran about

1111
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
25 or 30 phenoes of the f5s

1112
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,639
two they were we were pulling

1113
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,639
like between three to seven pounds off

1114
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,838
some of them plants and they were just

1115
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,199
monsters you know arm size colas from

1116
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,920
bottom to top

1117
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,000
um they're a little pm prone if you're

1118
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,880
in a pretty nasty area which can kind of

1119
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,920
be a bummer but if you're in a dry hot

1120
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,720
climate

1121
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,800
like here in the valley they thrive

1122
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,439
they've got really good root structure

1123
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,280
really good nutrient water uptake to

1124
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,358
them they have a good root they have a

1125
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,480
good root system yeah they're a little

1126
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,239
dangerous

1127
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,480
if you get some fog for sure because

1128
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,519
it's such thick buds

1129
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,599
you know

1130
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,358
they're not like big buds but they're

1131
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,200
very dense you know it's one of those

1132
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,559
things when it dries when you put it on

1133
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,759
there you're surprised at how much it

1134
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,318
weighs

1135
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,680
so it but it it both of them they are a

1136
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,159
little they are a little like uh pm and

1137
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,679
and uh and grey mold sensitive but

1138
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,679
that's like any

1139
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,078
i think all that lavender urkel all

1140
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,078
those super dense lines

1141
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,240
have that you know plants have pluses

1142
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,720
and minuses but that was it was a good

1143
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,239
grower i enjoyed growing it

1144
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:06,639
you know it's like okay if you're if

1145
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,759
you're in a hot air conditioned area

1146
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:12,799
like especially like here in arizona or

1147
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,520
colorado they do they do really well

1148
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,039
here in the valley they can be like

1149
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,719
110

1150
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,639
108 today and they're just like yep

1151
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,919
bring it come on

1152
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,679
so

1153
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,960
yeah it's brutal right now dude in the

1154
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,679
valley

1155
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,960
yeah where are we going on like over 40

1156
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,399
to 45 days of over a hundred and i think

1157
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,000
we still got

1158
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,838
like probably another 10 days at least

1159
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,559
that [ __ ] starts making me question my

1160
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:42,559
life choices

1161
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,679
you know it really is when it hits i

1162
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,880
mean it it's get it's a little much like

1163
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,879
plants

1164
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,960
i don't know but it is interesting in

1165
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,039
the sense that like

1166
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,119
the the hard part is you can get with

1167
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,119
like you're right in dry airy conditions

1168
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,119
you can get some monsters

1169
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,599
it's just about like keeping them

1170
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,519
hydrated and like and making sure they

1171
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,119
don't go b grade because it's too hot at

1172
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,318
night

1173
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,400
yeah and you know

1174
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,639
shade cloth is you got to have some

1175
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,318
shade cloth on them

1176
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,719
they can't take

1177
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,599
110 degree direct

1178
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,519
light for hours on end that just they

1179
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,960
just don't like it it's way more light

1180
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,679
than they need

1181
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,639
yeah and so you get like a good

1182
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,399
thirty to forty or fifty percent grade

1183
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,078
class i like the 30s

1184
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
just keep that over them the whole

1185
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,400
summer and they

1186
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,800
they do fine they thrive

1187
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,079
hydration is the key man

1188
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,680
so

1189
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,119
since you're growing in the valley and

1190
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,199
you have a lot of experience with it

1191
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,240
yeah someone asked a good question

1192
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,159
are some uh terps volatile to heat like

1193
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,598
are there some terps like some strange

1194
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,279
you cannot grow in the valley because it

1195
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,200
gets so [ __ ] hot during the summer

1196
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,640
there's no point because it gets surplus

1197
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,118
is that possible

1198
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,239
the terps will the terps will die you'll

1199
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,160
get that

1200
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,598
kind of

1201
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,639
like not hay but it smells like old weed

1202
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,119
almost

1203
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:13,598
and what also happened that i've seen is

1204
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,200
i've actually seen trichome heads melt

1205
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,200
out here

1206
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,639
yeah the heads will just literally be

1207
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,159
like

1208
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,838
and then you're left with a [ __ ]

1209
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,078
stalk of like

1210
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,599
like a dead tree kind of thing yeah and

1211
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,039
then it's like you can see it where it's

1212
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,640
oozed down

1213
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,119
and then you start getting like the

1214
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,559
titus type situation where it starts to

1215
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,079
rot kind of yeah i have seen that before

1216
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,318
i actually think

1217
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,960
one of the one of the reasons why a

1218
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:43,920
bunch of mendo and southern humboldt got

1219
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,079
so legendary for growing outdoor

1220
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,960
is that even though it might be blazing

1221
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,800
hot in the daytime that ocean comes in

1222
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,199
and it cools it down at night and when

1223
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,400
that plant gets to cool down

1224
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:58,318
like it preserves terps like if it's 105

1225
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,880
in the day but it gets down to 55

1226
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,279
degrees at night that makes an enormous

1227
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,519
difference in the quality of your plant

1228
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,440
and if you get too far inland like say

1229
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,318
grass valley grass valley you grow like

1230
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,838
some 10 or 15 pounders or the desert but

1231
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,440
that's what it's all about is trying to

1232
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,759
preserve your terps

1233
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,920
because if it's 108 in the daytime and

1234
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,280
85 at night

1235
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,720
you you run big risk of not like i said

1236
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,800
not quite hay

1237
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,879
but like not anything what your plant

1238
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,640
could be potential of you can definitely

1239
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,280
burn your terps off

1240
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,639
and i and and uh yeah makes it makes a

1241
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
big difference

1242
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,358
the key the key to growing in the

1243
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,559
central valley between like bakersfield

1244
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,480
and

1245
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,799
sacramento is

1246
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,159
realistically knowing your times of when

1247
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,599
to grow

1248
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,358
i always tell people

1249
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,200
if you're in fresno i don't grow outdoor

1250
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,000
in between like

1251
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,598
july and the end of september

1252
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,719
it's just unless you're gonna run a

1253
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,680
cooled

1254
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,759
depth it's not it's not [ __ ] worth it

1255
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,838
it's just no it's a battle

1256
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,160
you have to you have to run a water wall

1257
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,078
and like yeah like in like a greenhouse

1258
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,960
and add a bunch of moisture and cool it

1259
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,680
down

1260
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,599
yeah and they're like whoa it's it's

1261
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,039
it's warm and it's dry and i'm like yeah

1262
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,318
but you have the whole rest of the year

1263
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,960
you can get away with growing in the

1264
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,599
valley yeah you know you can grow from

1265
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,440
september all the way through until june

1266
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,519
yeah but you don't really need to stop

1267
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,039
growing in a central valley from that

1268
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,599
time but

1269
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:32,480
july august september

1270
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,480
take that time off like

1271
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,159
i even started taking summers off

1272
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,159
indoors because it was just such a

1273
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,000
[ __ ] battle like even trying to

1274
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,920
battle the air conditioner with indoors

1275
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,519
and all it was a [ __ ] nightmare every

1276
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,680
year in summer no matter indoor or

1277
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,559
outdoor that's why people call it summer

1278
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,159
bud

1279
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,159
yeah

1280
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,598
you know it's like a lot of times people

1281
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,920
have a hard time

1282
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,599
growing the best weed that they can in

1283
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,599
the middle of the summer

1284
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,599
they really do they you struggle with

1285
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,919
i conditions

1286
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:03,519
know if you've ever made seeds in that

1287
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
kind of condition

1288
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,440
but when you make seeds in over 100

1289
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,400
degree weather those [ __ ] are

1290
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,318
almost impossible to crack yes yeah

1291
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,119
it's still like

1292
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,719
like a rock yeah it's you need a lot of

1293
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,200
hand cracking with those too because

1294
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,480
they they they develop so thick and

1295
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,159
everything because they know that it's

1296
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,000
hot and they want to keep their their

1297
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:28,399
embryo alive that's crazy yeah yeah i

1298
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,358
mean now that now that we're like

1299
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,440
um

1300
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,960
you know things are getting

1301
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,679
whether you want to call legal or more

1302
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,358
acceptable or whatever it might be

1303
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,358
it's like we all used to grow weed where

1304
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,199
we could get away with it

1305
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,880
for the most part and

1306
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,279
there's not been a lot of thought of

1307
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,160
like which type of strains grow well

1308
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,240
where

1309
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,159
yeah you know because like in america

1310
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,318
it's like we grow citrus in florida

1311
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,960
right or winter wheat montana or

1312
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,920
potatoes in idaho or corn in illinois

1313
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,358
like you figure out where it works

1314
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,760
and we haven't really done that with

1315
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,759
weed no you know but there's so there's

1316
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,319
certain like i was even in mendo there's

1317
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,240
so many microclimates i'd have strains

1318
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,159
where like they did amazing in one part

1319
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,159
of the county and i'd get a different

1320
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:14,159
spot and i'd put them out and i'd be all

1321
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,480
and like stoked that i was gonna crush

1322
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,078
it and they wouldn't do that good

1323
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,400
but then there were some other strains i

1324
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,000
had that did really well so there's

1325
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,639
aspects where i'm sure

1326
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,719
there's some strains that like acclimate

1327
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,639
just like growing in british columbia or

1328
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,799
canada or something right there's

1329
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,440
probably some desert weed that's like

1330
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,599
more acclimated uh but we don't really

1331
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,400
think of things that way anymore

1332
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,720
right like it's names and popularity and

1333
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,599
maybe it's runts and maybe it's this and

1334
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,598
so

1335
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,519
you know um

1336
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,920
i think sativas deal with the heat

1337
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,639
better than indicas

1338
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,079
personally yeah yeah yeah i think so

1339
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,838
it's and they have they have better

1340
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,240
water absorption abilities they can hold

1341
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:57,599
water longer they got thinner leaves you

1342
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,519
know they're not they don't have as much

1343
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,440
exposure like and they and they come

1344
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,318
from places that are hot as [ __ ]

1345
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,679
yeah

1346
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,039
a lot of them

1347
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,759
you know

1348
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,558
so one one thing i noticed this year was

1349
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,960
um

1350
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,720
people who are moving clones from one

1351
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,440
end of the state to the other

1352
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:17,358
are

1353
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,519
experiencing

1354
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,119
like it's almost like culture shock for

1355
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,719
the plants because they're used to one

1356
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,318
environment and then you're moving them

1357
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,558
all the way to another environment in

1358
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:29,119
the state and they're like

1359
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,119
but some are like yeah they love it so

1360
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,720
it kind of falls into the same

1361
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,240
category g with the clone stock

1362
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,919
it's a serious thing people don't take

1363
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,519
into account but some strains definitely

1364
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,920
are more picky than others when

1365
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,000
acclimatizing even from one grow room to

1366
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,920
the next in the same city it just that

1367
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,159
difference can really flip it you would

1368
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,440
like to think that like you can work

1369
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:53,679
with most nurseries and like get a cl

1370
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,599
you know like tough and hardened off

1371
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,000
plants that are going to be suited for

1372
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,599
your environment but a lot of cases

1373
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,280
you know clone companies are you know

1374
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,079
nurseries nowadays

1375
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,200
they have these plants under 24 7 light

1376
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,119
and they're just trying to keep them

1377
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,960
rooted and healthy until somebody buys

1378
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,160
them yeah and then they get taken from

1379
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,559
like 24 7 light under fluorescence they

1380
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,078
get boxed up in the dark like he said

1381
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,400
they get shipped down from northern

1382
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,160
california to your desert they get

1383
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,119
opened up and then bam they're in the

1384
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,519
desert

1385
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,519
and they're flowering and it's and

1386
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:26,719
and the light drops by eight hours in

1387
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,960
one night yeah

1388
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,679
yeah right because you used to be able

1389
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,599
to like if you grew in mendo or southern

1390
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,679
humboldt or somewhere like that like

1391
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,200
most people would acclimate their clones

1392
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,719
and plants for their own season yeah

1393
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,799
nowadays you buy you know people just

1394
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,239
want to buy them from somewhere but it's

1395
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,160
like i mean when i was working in

1396
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,838
southern california you would go

1397
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,799
the the longest day of the year down

1398
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,639
there is maybe 14 or 15 hours

1399
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,480
so you're getting you're going from 24

1400
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,879
hours to 14.

1401
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,400
it's a 10 hour drop in one day you could

1402
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,440
have a plant trigger

1403
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,200
just from the shock of the light cycle

1404
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,200
yeah well that's kind of what happened

1405
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,199
to me this year is i had

1406
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,719
some clone stock that i had in southern

1407
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:11,199
humble

1408
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:14,078
spent two days three days

1409
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,358
making the trip down here and i got here

1410
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,160
put them out here and everything was

1411
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:16,960
like

1412
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,920
oh

1413
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,920
no we don't like this

1414
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,199
so yeah i kind of had a little bit of a

1415
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,920
rough transition this this last couple

1416
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,639
months and so i just kind of gave up and

1417
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,800
just

1418
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,719
that bucket i'll just wait until i can

1419
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,119
get back into another good position to

1420
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,159
be able to do some real work you know

1421
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,000
yeah

1422
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,159
you know it's also one of those things

1423
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,838
too where it's like a lot of the some of

1424
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,879
the stuff that's getting really popular

1425
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,599
right now

1426
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,920
um indica style is probably best for

1427
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,039
like being grown more northern climate

1428
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,119
right

1429
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,119
where you get way far south like where

1430
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,039
you guys are and you almost need some

1431
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,440
sativa mixed into your work if you want

1432
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,519
it to grow outdoor and stretch

1433
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,440
right because it's far enough south that

1434
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,880
it'll trigger fast

1435
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,720
that's kind of that's kind of one of the

1436
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
things that i've seen and so people

1437
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,399
think that like oh you know like

1438
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,318
figuring out what works well in your

1439
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,838
area is huge

1440
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,759
in uh

1441
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,759
you know it really is it's big

1442
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,519
yeah for sure

1443
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,880
i wanted to i wanted to keep going over

1444
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,719
a little bit more of the green craft

1445
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,400
stuff because i know that's probably

1446
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,399
what people want to hear the most about

1447
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,079
because it's it's a strain like when we

1448
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,400
were working with it it was it was the

1449
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,119
clone was a lot of places and then

1450
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,039
it was nowhere all of a sudden

1451
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,680
it's become a lot it's become a lost

1452
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,800
legend and misnamed and all kinds of

1453
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,960
stuff you know

1454
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,880
lots of imposters lots of seed lines

1455
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,559
that weren't real and right there with

1456
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,960
the lavender you don't see the lavender

1457
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,599
around anymore either not that miracle

1458
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,159
lavender you really don't not anymore

1459
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,599
no these were all strains that that

1460
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,719
so we had that

1461
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,280
we had that push for strains that were

1462
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,118
um like the blue dream yeah everybody

1463
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,760
was like [ __ ] blue dream buck the

1464
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,000
[ __ ] lavender [ __ ] you know these

1465
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,839
these strains that just hit a wall all

1466
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,760
of a sudden and we're gone nobody wanted

1467
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,920
them so nobody kept him there might be

1468
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,040
some random dude around that has a cut

1469
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,800
of it but

1470
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,480
yeah it's a little healthy or not he

1471
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,359
[ __ ] knows you know

1472
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,039
yeah so yeah

1473
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,558
that is one of the biggest things is

1474
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,239
trying to be a collector and trying to

1475
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,319
keep genetics alive

1476
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,159
is that everybody will help you back it

1477
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,079
up when it's flying out the door is

1478
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,719
flower and it's easy to sell

1479
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,318
and then as soon as the mood changes

1480
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,318
your most of your best friends don't

1481
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,000
even want unless they can sell it to

1482
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,000
market and it's working for them right

1483
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,440
now they only want to keep

1484
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,318
clones of like what's currently popular

1485
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,480
yeah and so i mean i mean everyone and i

1486
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,119
mean everyone that was growing a decent

1487
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,960
amount of weed in humboldt and mendo

1488
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,880
in the 2004 0506 era they had one of

1489
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,639
those urkel or one of those lavender or

1490
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,880
one of those grape ape or one of those

1491
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:05,118
cuts you know and you know green crack

1492
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,000
green crack's a great plant

1493
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,880
if you grow it small to medium sized

1494
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,760
it's got really nice terps you know

1495
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,599
it's got a nice buzz it burns well um

1496
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,200
but people got burnt out on it because

1497
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,800
just like blue dreams someone's like oh

1498
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,279
i can grow a 12

1499
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,680
plant of this in grass valley and it's

1500
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,680
gonna be bee weed and i'm gonna ship it

1501
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,960
off and it's gonna be endless amounts of

1502
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,639
boofy green crack the one that the green

1503
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,519
crack two was like

1504
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,838
half the plant was larv

1505
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:36,880
yeah and so and then that part that was

1506
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,199
trimmable

1507
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,559
was usually the trimmers [ __ ] hated

1508
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,719
it they were like walk this plant and so

1509
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,240
yeah it kind of just went by the wayside

1510
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,239
pretty quick

1511
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,318
but what's funny about that one is that

1512
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,558
you think about like the eras

1513
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:54,318
imagine if that had had like its moment

1514
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,240
in the sun now

1515
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,838
when everyone's extracting and all that

1516
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:02,959
laffy stuff probably would dump

1517
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:05,279
well it was a great so

1518
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,358
from my experience it was a great

1519
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,920
um like you could blow it it would blow

1520
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:12,558
great but if you tried to wash it it was

1521
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,838
um it was almost too greasy like you

1522
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,000
didn't

1523
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,799
yeah it was just kind of fell into that

1524
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,760
category of it was just too hard to work

1525
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,800
with

1526
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,720
um and so yeah that's kind of why that's

1527
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,480
kind of why i got away from it

1528
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,039
i i've been trying to figure out what

1529
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,119
green crack is for a long time years and

1530
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,039
years and years and over the years as my

1531
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,800
experience gets better with different

1532
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,719
strains you know my opinion kind of

1533
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,559
changes on what i think it might be

1534
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,239
early on i was like this has got to be

1535
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,280
some kind of so mango because it's so

1536
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:45,199
purple and it's super mango so i was

1537
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,160
like okay the mango purple it's got to

1538
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,318
be that

1539
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,558
and as i went on okay i see some skunk

1540
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,279
one in this okay you know with the mango

1541
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,400
over time and and and the more i look at

1542
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,400
it and the more

1543
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,079
i figure it out the more i realize i bet

1544
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,519
it might even be a mendo purp something

1545
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,000
yeah

1546
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,079
okay so that's where the story kind of

1547
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,960
gets convoluted because

1548
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,559
a lot of people associate purple

1549
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,599
with green crack

1550
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,079
now

1551
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,000
what i was running what i what i was

1552
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,240
calling the candy crack does not get

1553
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,199
purple i don't care you can get it down

1554
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,759
to 20 degrees it does not get purple

1555
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:25,358
yeah at all and it's more watermelon

1556
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,119
skunk than mango interesting interesting

1557
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:28,880
that that lends more towards the skunk

1558
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,358
one side than that

1559
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,680
if it's a skunk i mean you can look at

1560
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:36,639
it and just the way that it forms its

1561
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,719
its spear buds all over itself you can

1562
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:39,440
definitely see some skunk influence in

1563
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,000
it

1564
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,798
i will say that if it is a skunk one

1565
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,358
fino it's definitely my favorite tasting

1566
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:49,199
pheno of skunk one yeah

1567
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:52,480
you know it has at night it has no when

1568
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:54,558
it's done right it has nice terps

1569
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,199
yeah the original seeds i used to make

1570
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,960
the uh the green craft stuff that like

1571
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,199
uh what were they called

1572
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,798
that company that made green crack s1s

1573
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,798
but a spanish company

1574
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,318
yeah they used they used our s1s to make

1575
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:12,399
the s2s and sold them as swans but um

1576
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,798
it was heavy purple like and it wasn't

1577
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,280
always purple but it was like the like

1578
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:19,199
three degrees of cold change it would

1579
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,480
just flip black almost like mental

1580
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,279
purpose does and um yeah it was super

1581
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,838
super overripe mangoes

1582
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,000
purple not not frosty like a cookie's

1583
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,279
cut but it was good resin for its time

1584
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,519
it was good present it was it was an

1585
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,920
attractive weed done right yeah and

1586
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:38,719
really sure fiery orange hairs and yeah

1587
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,318
and i see people mentioning cecil like

1588
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:41,759
me and cecil when we first met each

1589
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:42,880
other we tried to figure out if he had

1590
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,599
anything to do with it what we

1591
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,240
determined he had nothing to do with san

1592
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,400
diego west coast green crab nothing at

1593
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:54,479
all it was just that when we received

1594
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:57,599
the cut uh but it was it was c-u-s-h

1595
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,559
and he sent a cut west that was also

1596
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,559
spelled wrong c-u-s-h and that was it

1597
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,319
somebody said better keeper than cheese

1598
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,920
i would rather have real green crack

1599
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:08,000
than cheese but that's like a personal

1600
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,000
preference yeah personal preference for

1601
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,318
sure personal preference but my personal

1602
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,760
preference was i would rather smoke and

1603
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,199
you know what's interesting is that we

1604
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,920
were talking about how

1605
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,639
you know uh unreliable uh philos was

1606
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,720
earlier which is a bummer because all of

1607
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,719
us have these like great desires to know

1608
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:27,199
how things are related yeah and i

1609
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,558
remember caleb telling me that like

1610
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:29,679
uh when

1611
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,559
uh

1612
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:34,000
dna submitted their las vegas lemon

1613
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,880
skunk

1614
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,318
that it came in exactly the same cut as

1615
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,240
green crack

1616
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,318
yeah it doesn't surprise me those guys

1617
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,078
are the worst for that but like dnas

1618
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,639
their their cantaloupe pays was just the

1619
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,559
c99 i mean but i just mean in the sense

1620
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:50,239
that it was a it was a good enough cut

1621
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,319
that they used it and all kinds of

1622
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,479
things yeah they just got rid of like

1623
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,318
the name connotation you know like oh we

1624
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,480
won't call it green crack it'll be las

1625
00:57:56,318 --> 00:58:00,318
vegas lemon skunk

1626
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,440
right yeah and it is kind of lemon

1627
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:03,679
skunky

1628
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,760
that's why i was kind of leaning like

1629
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,719
when they start talking about the green

1630
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,839
ribbon

1631
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,078
what i know is my candy has more leans

1632
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,838
towards that i believe than the green

1633
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,599
crack i always kind of was wondering if

1634
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:18,078
the green crack was just an offshoot

1635
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,838
from that or maybe i had an offshoot of

1636
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,798
the original green crack that's where i

1637
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,358
don't know

1638
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:24,318
yeah that's where it got completed and

1639
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:25,920
that's

1640
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,279
people will start hitting me up and it

1641
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,599
turns into an argument and i just

1642
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,079
started being like [ __ ] it i don't know

1643
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,838
anymore oh my god dude somebody's mind

1644
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,160
just got blown in the comments and they

1645
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,960
just realized that cantaloupe hayes was

1646
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,960
c99

1647
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,880
so the story was soma and this this came

1648
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:46,239
from uh i won't say what came from but

1649
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,599
it came from the amsterdam dudes that

1650
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,439
were friends with all these guys and a

1651
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,200
part of the same group and soma gave

1652
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,559
them a pack of c99 to start their

1653
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:57,039
company and sure enough that c99 became

1654
00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:00,319
the eight week haze magical eight-week

1655
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:01,599
case magical 95 sativa and comes in in

1656
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:03,679
eight weeks

1657
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,559
yeah yeah no i just thought that comment

1658
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,798
just

1659
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,400
that just that's just yeah that's funny

1660
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,480
well because that they were they were

1661
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,400
some of the first people

1662
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,318
that they went around california and

1663
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,079
they took a bunch of famous cuts and

1664
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,558
they gave them different names and they

1665
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,318
started a seed company with it yeah and

1666
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,000
they did really well

1667
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,719
isn't like brothers graham try to take

1668
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,559
the credit for his b99 isn't he like 99

1669
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,199
guy or something like that well his

1670
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,640
partner was his partner was and now he's

1671
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,639
here so that's what we're left with

1672
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,119
after meeting him and then you're

1673
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,280
learning how to partner everything it's

1674
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,000
like oh that makes sense then okay you

1675
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,359
know

1676
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,960
yeah okay

1677
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,358
but yeah i mean green crack kids have

1678
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,960
got in my opinion got a bad reputation

1679
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:49,119
because most of the time

1680
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,199
you could you could grow an eight or ten

1681
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,200
pound plant of green crack

1682
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,279
and it would kind of suck

1683
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:57,759
but if you grew like a four or five

1684
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,480
pound plant of green crack it was really

1685
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,599
nice and if you grew a one or two pound

1686
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,119
plant of it it was killer yeah so most

1687
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,200
people just tried to blow it up into

1688
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,400
these like i'm going to grow 99 green

1689
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,879
cracks

1690
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,639
and get just boucou weed and i'm not

1691
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,160
going to dry it that nice and then

1692
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:15,039
people are like oh i don't like green

1693
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,239
crack

1694
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,000
yeah

1695
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,639
and so that's what happens to a lot of

1696
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,039
big yielding cuts like blue dream green

1697
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:25,679
crack uh you know barry white these

1698
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:28,400
various ones that run through they get

1699
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:31,440
blown out by people that don't care

1700
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,358
chili verdes got kind of a bad rap

1701
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,318
through the distros in california

1702
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:38,318
because of the dark heart cut so dark

1703
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,079
heart [ __ ] jumped on a cut of chili

1704
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:40,960
verde they got

1705
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,200
um

1706
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,119
from a friend of mine named moongazer

1707
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,358
moongazer kind of did a quick little

1708
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,480
final hunt dropped a chili cut on them

1709
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,318
real fast

1710
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,280
and it wasn't the greatest chili and it

1711
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:54,880
wasn't producing the best flour so all

1712
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,200
these growers that jumped on it right

1713
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,798
away took all this flower to the distros

1714
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,480
and the distros were like oh we can't

1715
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,159
[ __ ] do anything with this

1716
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,119
so it kind of

1717
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,279
like

1718
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,920
it's like depends on who you talk to and

1719
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,200
like who really liked the chili and

1720
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,119
because of which cut they had now

1721
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,960
the purple city cut or if they were

1722
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,119
running a cut for me

1723
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,639
um yeah

1724
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,480
the distros take it but if you're

1725
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,239
running like a dark heart cut they might

1726
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,798
not take it

1727
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,719
what's nice about that is that

1728
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,159
you know it seems like in chile verde

1729
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,078
that there's a number of people that

1730
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,159
found a number of cuts that had like a

1731
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,599
range of terps and effects that they

1732
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,000
liked

1733
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,440
well that's that's because of the fact

1734
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,519
that i dumped all the seeds on the

1735
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,280
market i didn't leave it to be just a

1736
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,480
single clone only

1737
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,200
cut right

1738
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,119
being just one or two cuts out there i

1739
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,239
made sure that i got enough seeds out to

1740
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,079
the farmers

1741
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,759
that there was some diversity that

1742
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,119
people could start actually pheno

1743
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,440
hunting out some good stuff because

1744
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,119
there are there's a lot of good phenos

1745
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,519
in it you know there's a few duds here

1746
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,798
and there but there's [ __ ] some fire

1747
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,038
in it especially as you start working

1748
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:05,599
the line depending on which way you go

1749
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,520
um i started going with this like a

1750
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,200
pineapple there's a pineapple pheno in

1751
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,358
there that i've been working

1752
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,439
i really like that one the terpenes

1753
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,558
profile is super high

1754
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,079
and then there's the grape you know

1755
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,559
that kind of everybody knows that

1756
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,240
grapefino is really good

1757
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,319
and then there's kind of more of an

1758
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,358
unknown cheese pinot that floats in

1759
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,239
there too

1760
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:31,679
and that cheese pinot is bomb like it's

1761
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:33,759
really good i gave um the humboldt local

1762
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,759
joey i gave him some of the cheese ones

1763
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,799
and he was like

1764
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,799
they turned out funny

1765
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,440
cheese

1766
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,480
chili verde sweet lavender cheese

1767
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,119
yeah where the cheese comes out of it

1768
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,760
i'm not really sure but so in like the

1769
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,640
key lime pie the key lime pie

1770
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,839
i was told originally it was durbin

1771
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,440
poison

1772
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,880
og kush

1773
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,280
cherry pie

1774
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,480
but i'm not sure that does that sound

1775
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,440
like that still hold true to it or not i

1776
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,679
mean key lime pie is also like it was

1777
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,639
also going around as the green sherb the

1778
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,078
original sherb um also stardust sherb

1779
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,118
for a while as well

1780
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,599
um

1781
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,079
i if i remember correctly it's the mom

1782
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,760
of what became skittles is is what

1783
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,680
people mostly tend to think that have

1784
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,000
been growing a bunch of it so you can

1785
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:29,838
find like the skittles type phenos in in

1786
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,838
the out crosses and and in the s-ones um

1787
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:33,038
but yeah as far as what it actually is

1788
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:34,798
it's kind of like trying to peg down

1789
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,559
what cherry pie actually is it's just

1790
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:38,880
like wow [ __ ] they said a thousand

1791
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,319
things i think i think it's likely that

1792
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,838
all those things you mentioned are in

1793
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:46,000
there in some form or another

1794
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:47,599
yeah you know that's like the cheese is

1795
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,880
the only one that kind of throws me off

1796
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,760
because there is a very distinctive

1797
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,798
cheese pinot that i did find in the f1

1798
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,720
um

1799
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,079
and yeah it was

1800
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,399
like i didn't know if it came out of the

1801
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,000
durbin side or maybe the og fight or the

1802
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,798
cherry yeah just wasn't really like

1803
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,599
okay

1804
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,679
so

1805
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,760
the the durbin that those dudes used was

1806
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,318
it was so different from like the norcal

1807
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,880
derb or the the colorado derb it was

1808
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,639
nothing like it it was it was it was it

1809
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,559
was not terrifying

1810
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,558
yeah it wasn't the terpentaline stuff at

1811
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,760
all no

1812
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,359
and then you know we're just in the

1813
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,520
infancy of figuring out how these

1814
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,719
different things flavor combined

1815
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,838
yeah

1816
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:30,318
you know so i you know maybe it maybe it

1817
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,078
uh yeah and then i also think too like

1818
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,759
when people smell

1819
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,519
it's like they related to things in

1820
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,359
their life so it's really weird like

1821
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,679
someone might get strong cheese and

1822
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,199
somebody else might like get a totally

1823
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,719
different impression

1824
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:45,279
yeah you know

1825
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,279
totally i i see that all the time like

1826
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,280
almost like when you go to shows and

1827
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,920
you're showing people jars and they're

1828
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,480
you'll show maybe like 100 people the

1829
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,240
jar and you'll hear like 20 different

1830
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,960
comments of what they smell and they're

1831
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,639
all different you know i actually really

1832
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,599
like that a lot i used to do that with

1833
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:05,118
my trimmers where i would ask them away

1834
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,480
from the rest of the trimmers what they

1835
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:10,160
were smelling with what they were

1836
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,318
working on because i liked unvarnished

1837
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,879
like opinions and then if i heard the

1838
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:17,279
same thing four or five times

1839
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,920
i'd start to accept that people got that

1840
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,599
terp or that aroma they didn't call it

1841
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,240
terps then or whatever i just wanted to

1842
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,079
know what they related it to

1843
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,639
you know because because the language of

1844
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,318
it is so hard and so if somebody said

1845
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:31,920
you know and a lot of strains i grew

1846
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:33,440
over and over and over again and so i

1847
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,720
would ask different trimmers over the

1848
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,559
years like what do you think the maui

1849
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,558
smells like what do you think this this

1850
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,960
smells like and

1851
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,640
sometimes their answers would be pretty

1852
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,559
surprising

1853
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,239
you know and you wouldn't have seen that

1854
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,920
before they said it but then when they

1855
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,479
say it it clicks

1856
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,720
so i do i do think asking people's

1857
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,798
opinions like a show would be a really

1858
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,919
cool place to get a bunch of

1859
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,079
quick

1860
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,680
back you know like feedback on what

1861
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,599
something smells like

1862
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:04,719
yeah yeah somebody was telling me

1863
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,440
recently that uh zometical farmer

1864
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:11,038
he's got a chili that's like

1865
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,960
i think he said it was papaya or guava

1866
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,079
something like that i forget exactly

1867
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,000
what it was

1868
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,000
but yeah i was like i've never i've

1869
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,159
never smelled that in it but then we

1870
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,079
were going through some jars recently

1871
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,000
and somebody was like

1872
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,400
oh yeah i smell it totally i was like oh

1873
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,079
okay yeah i get it now

1874
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,160
i think i think flan nailed it on the

1875
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,720
head there might be some skunk one and

1876
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,558
cherry pie and key lime pie and all that

1877
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,159
it sounds like it's just the whole gamut

1878
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,960
of skunk one smells the grape the

1879
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,639
[ __ ] cheese the all that is in there

1880
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,880
i mean there's there's an aspect too

1881
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:44,239
where you know it is possible

1882
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,160
that um

1883
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:48,479
you know a lot of durbin

1884
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,239
you know had skunk one in it because it

1885
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,480
came through sam

1886
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,639
yeah you know and and a lot of durbin

1887
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,400
came through dutch passion later on they

1888
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,798
sold the durbin poison and that had more

1889
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,039
skunk one in it evident so it was like

1890
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,079
yeah so it's definitely it's definitely

1891
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,799
possible

1892
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,720
i'm thinking that that the uh the f1

1893
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,159
derb is probably a hybrid of the dutch

1894
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:11,038
passion one because it looks like some

1895
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:15,358
of the old pictures of the old but just

1896
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:17,599
grown much better in now today times

1897
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,279
yeah

1898
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,280
i mean durbin's one of those strains

1899
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,519
that like is so old

1900
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,599
that most people don't have experience

1901
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,559
with what durbin was like in the 80s and

1902
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,359
90s

1903
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,079
yeah

1904
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:32,239
you know and then what survived too you

1905
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,000
know and then

1906
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,759
yeah the black versus

1907
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,798
associated with durban

1908
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,480
yes and but then that colorado cut and

1909
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:43,519
some of those other ones that got famous

1910
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,798
later were super terpenolene yeah

1911
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,679
you know and once you've got your

1912
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:49,358
penduline in a line it hangs out

1913
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:51,519
yeah it's hard to shake it out it's hard

1914
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,598
to shake it out but i do like you know

1915
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:56,480
we i worked with a durbin in the early

1916
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:59,838
2000s and it was definitely more on that

1917
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,679
anise black licorice type of aroma and

1918
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,279
we didn't really get like this the type

1919
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,598
of terpenoline

1920
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,440
that seems to huh did you say it was

1921
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,119
more like your black anis

1922
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,838
is that what she just said

1923
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,838
you know

1924
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,560
so you know it's

1925
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,279
indeed

1926
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,279
indeed

1927
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,960
so what are you working on now eric

1928
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,480

01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,439
like the normal market that comes to me

1974
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,520
may not be interested in that but the

1975
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,158
market that i haven't been tapping into

1976
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,800
because i only sell regs i'm hoping

1977
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,759
they'll be like yeah we're on them you

1978
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,960
know

1979
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,320
i've been trying

1980
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,158
i've been trying to explain this to

1981
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,479
people that um

1982
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:18,879
what's going on with our market and that

1983
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:21,279
and and a lot of people [ __ ] on when i

1984
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,960
say it but it's true like if to have a

1985
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,880
viable seat company you have to tap into

1986
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,880
that market or it just doesn't work

1987
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,679
there's not enough people to support

1988
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,359
uh the niche market of rare strains old

1989
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,440
strains unique strength it's just not

1990
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:36,880
there anymore nobody gives a [ __ ]

1991
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,759
yeah it's weird that in the last

1992
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,319
you know

1993
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,920
i mean we went from four or five people

1994
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:46,880
doing feminized stuff 12 or 14 years ago

1995
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,239
to 99 of the market or more being

1996
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,520
feminized stuff

1997
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:52,879
and reg seeds which was the standard for

1998
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,000
forever

1999
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,119
are now like a a tiny little corner

2000
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,800
yeah

2001
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,640
um is the kiddos and crybaby's right

2002
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,920
this girl's rarity crosses will take off

2003
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,679
people give him a chance especially

2004
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,319
because it's almost like a

2005
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,520
uh uh a back rock in a sense a back

2006
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,679
cross to the

2007
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,000
the key lime pie by the skittles it

2008
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,760
probably be a terp explosion and it

2009
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,439
would probably grow better and look

2010
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,159
better than skittles

2011
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,519
it's not hard you know no no skills is

2012
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:21,279
not

2013
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,440
it's got chilly structure so it holds

2014
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:25,519
itself up it doesn't want to fall over

2015
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:27,279
and [ __ ] be like

2016
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,280
yeah you can smell you can smell the

2017
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,719
skittles in there but chili's there too

2018
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,399
it's like

2019
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,319
and it's um i don't know if you run the

2020
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,279
dirty skills or if you're familiar with

2021
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,799
that it's a new one from i think micah

2022
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:42,639

2023
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,239
peace and meds he's got that farm um

2024
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,159
i think he has that lamborghini or

2025
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,599
whatever it is yeah

2026
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:48,559
i know exactly what you're talking about

2027
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,960
yeah

2028
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,360
it's really similar to that

2029
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,800
but yeah i'm i really dug it i went

2030

01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,960
in a spot right now where i can do

2072
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,880
anything i'm just

2073
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,800

2075
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,800
boogaloo dog [ __ ] [ __ ]

2076
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,119
that kind of meat i like that it's got

2077
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,640
it's got nice flavor it's pretty it's

2078
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,880

2079
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,560
you know yeah lonesome loves that one

2080
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,520
too that's one of his face too yeah i

2081
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,280
know it's

2082
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,239
a nice sativa

2083
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:46,319
and i think

2084
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:48,319
i think a lot of people are in that same

2085
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,238
boat there's a lot of breeders

2086
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:52,000
right now that are looking around at

2087
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:53,678
like what should i like what what would

2088
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,600
i like to do and then they're trying to

2089
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,319
figure out well what should i do to make

2090
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,239
it

2091
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:59,759
you know like and it's it's kind of a

2092
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:02,079
hard thing to navigate like you were

2093
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,920
talking about growing hypey things and

2094
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,519
trying to figure out where you fit in

2095
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,480
and all that so

2096
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,920
um

2097
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,639
you know there's a lot of breeders in

2098
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,640
the game right now but it's it takes

2099
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,400
it's kind of a lot

2100
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,760
there's a lot of seed makers in the game

2101
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,238
right there's a lot of scenes a lot of

2102
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,840
raiders it's very real i can't even put

2103
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:20,959
myself in the breeding category anymore

2104
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,480
i can't remember the last time i've

2105
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,158
worked like worked a line several

2106
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:25,919
generations it's just

2107
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:28,559
it's hard to it's hard to do that

2108
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,199
nowadays and know that

2109
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,600
it's probably not going to sell you know

2110
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:35,839
yeah it's crazy there's there's two

2111
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,719
distinct markets that have broken out

2112
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:42,560
that you kind of like if you're making

2113
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:45,279
seeds you have to be making washers

2114
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,520
something that washes yeah

2115
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:49,599
the hash guys are gonna want cause the

2116
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,280
extract thing that's where it's all

2117
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,320
seemed to be going to

2118
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,158
or

2119
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,799
your hypey market

2120
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:59,039
because the hypey market once the hypey

2121
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,520
guys get a hold of that [ __ ] they're the

2122
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:03,920
ones that find that cut

2123
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,280
and then that cut gets taken over to the

2124
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,840
commercial growers and then the

2125
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,800
commercial growers blow it up yeah and

2126
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,800
so if you're not tapping into those two

2127
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,640
you're you're kind of like

2128
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,800
oh well what am i like what the [ __ ] am

2129
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,320
i gonna do you know because i was stuck

2130
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,039
in the middle for the longest time where

2131
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:23,119
i had these dedicated lines of regulars

2132
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,640
that i was making

2133
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:27,279
i have

2134
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,119
certain growers that like to run those

2135
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,639
lines and they're willing to to go

2136
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,800
through my stuff but

2137
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:36,320
the hype market which is the general

2138
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,480
consumer who grows six or ten plants who

2139
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,158
doesn't want anything to do with

2140
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,718
males they don't want anything to do

2141
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:43,599
with pinot hunting stuff that they don't

2142
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,679
know

2143
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,280
and so if they recognize it and they can

2144
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,600
pop it and they can grow it real quick

2145
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,679
and smoke it and they like it that seems

2146
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,840
to be where it's at so

2147
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,279
washers

2148
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,119
yeah

2149
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,279
yeah that's for real i mean people

2150
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,920
people only see what we present like out

2151
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,840
front and i always talk about this like

2152
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,359
a lot of it is smoking mirrors like

2153
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,920
there's a few of us who don't care to

2154
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:09,759
front like we're rich or famous you know

2155
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,520
that are just farmers

2156
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,719
but a lot of people it's all smoke and

2157
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,719
mirrors and they present like they're

2158
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,800
[ __ ] flexing [ __ ]

2159
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,439
blinging chains and [ __ ] if you're

2160
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,719
wearing a gold chain and like going to

2161
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,079
all these events everywhere you're

2162
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,679
probably not doing much growing because

2163
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,000
most of us are tied to the [ __ ] row

2164
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,239
you know what i mean um

2165
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,279
yeah smoke and mirrors is a lot and

2166
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:33,279
behind the scenes ever since covet there

2167
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,960
are there are seed makers and breeders

2168
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,880
alike you know they'll message me and

2169
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,480
tell me that this is they're scared for

2170
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,159
their future and they don't know who to

2171
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,399
talk to and it's it's hard so i don't

2172
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:45,279
have any answers because i [ __ ] i i'm

2173
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:47,198
the same spot as all them you know um

2174
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:49,439
but it is what it is and people get the

2175
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:51,759
market that they pay for and eventually

2176
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:54,559
the people that that have that small

2177
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,640
niche market of the the two percent that

2178
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,880
want something unique that like running

2179
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,480
seeds to find their own unique thing

2180
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,719
that's not enough to hold over the whole

2181
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:05,119
market so eventually some something's

2182
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,119
gonna have to change or or we have to

2183
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,519
change to

2184
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:12,399
yeah reflect the market

2185
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,600
yeah no i know i'm i'm struggling like

2186
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:17,679
really bad right now like yeah

2187
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,280
i'm kind of worried like if i'll have

2188
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,520
enough money for my bills next month

2189
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:24,079
kind of thing you know

2190
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,440
there's there's a lot going on in the

2191
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,679
world

2192
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:29,678
there's a lot of potential in the world

2193
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,600
right now what's going on with all these

2194
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,039
countries coming online

2195
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,199
and i'm just like man i hope i can just

2196
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,840
get by long enough to where i can get to

2197
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,839
a spot where i can be okay but yeah i

2198
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,119
don't even know if i'll ever make it to

2199
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,679
that you know

2200
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,439
yeah there's definitely a lot of soul

2201
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,679
searching going on

2202
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:52,799
in the weed community right now

2203
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:55,119
you know about what what works and you

2204
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,520
know i think there's a natural human

2205
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:59,519
instinct to like get good at a certain

2206
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,280
niche or a certain aspect of something

2207
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,880
and keep doing it and you just want that

2208
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:04,719
to continue

2209
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,800
right because it works for you and

2210
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,960
you're good at it and then life throws

2211
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,000
you curveballs and

2212
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:15,679
you know um one of the cool things about

2213
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,279
like the 215 era was how diverse it was

2214
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,000
how many different people could be

2215
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:20,880
involved on different levels and make a

2216
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,679
living

2217
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,640
and now it's getting consolidated and

2218
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,239
you know

2219
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,600
the amount of people that used to make a

2220
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:30,000
living off it are probably not going to

2221
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,920
make a living off at that that time

2222
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,319
so how do you fit in how do you work how

2223
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,840
do you survive how do you make it happen

2224
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:38,000
you know and that's the thing is i'm

2225
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,560
noticing that i don't fit into the new

2226
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,800
world like i've tried to get jobs

2227
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,840
numerous times at these new

2228
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,360
facilities or these new operations that

2229
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,440
are licensed and

2230
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,920
i'm either not getting hired or i'm

2231
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:54,479
getting ghosted once i get there

2232
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,359
or i show up and it's so [ __ ] up i

2233
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,238
leave

2234
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:57,839
yeah

2235
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:00,718
and so

2236
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:03,039
yeah i i'm to the point now where

2237
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:06,000
i'm like i'm gonna go take a job doing

2238
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:08,560
delivery or doing something else and

2239
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,198
just grow my hobby weed on my own and

2240
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,000
just be like [ __ ] the weed world

2241
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:16,719
but i'm still like still trying to hold

2242
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,760
on you know i i've retired from the fact

2243
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,319
that

2244
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,400
i will not be a licensed company

2245
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,319
yeah walton's cannabis company

2246
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:26,559
that's what that video a few months back

2247
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,559
was i'm i'm retiring i'm getting the

2248
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,080
[ __ ] out of this i'm done with it

2249
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,760
and i kind of

2250
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,319
misled people in the fact that i was

2251
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,960
getting out of the weed world i was just

2252
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,198
saying i'm retiring from trying to be a

2253
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,480
company like a licensed company

2254
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:42,960
um yeah

2255
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:45,039
it it sounded great like early on you

2256
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,719
know like oh the wheat people can

2257
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,960
finally they would have been ones who've

2258
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,399
been fighting for this to make it legal

2259
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,480
fighting for legalization

2260
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:55,198
finally get to grow we finally get to

2261
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:57,919
grow safely not get guns put to our head

2262
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,919
not end up in prison and that's rad and

2263
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,319
then that was all just

2264
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,880
yanked out from under us i mean there's

2265
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,559
a there's an aspect too with that where

2266
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,279
you know i mean maybe some of the

2267
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,679
pricing was risk factor

2268
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:13,279
and a willingness to take risks and a

2269
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,840
willingness to have some balls to do

2270
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:17,920
some of that stuff and yeah you know and

2271
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,560
so as the risk goes out so does some of

2272
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,359
the probability and then the margins get

2273
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,560
tighter on things and you know the other

2274
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:27,359
part of it is you know when we were

2275
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,639
talking about hype things is

2276
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,359
part of it for

2277
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,520
older growers is that all of the skill

2278
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:36,000
sets that kept us alive and safe for a

2279
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,560
long time are starting to change

2280
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,079
so we wanted to be invisible we wanted

2281
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,679
to be low-key i mean when you when we

2282
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:43,920
were talking earlier on the beginning of

2283
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,679
the show i mean he's he basically you

2284
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,480
crawled out from under your rock like

2285
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,800
2014 2015

2286
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,279
right not that long you know like so you

2287
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,000
were growing a long time and hiding

2288
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:59,039
and staying quiet and now the people

2289
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,719
that are doing you know somewhat better

2290
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,158
are really loud

2291
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,079
and really out there and really

2292
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,319
promoting themselves and that's not the

2293
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:09,119
skill set most of us had

2294
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:11,119
yeah right self-promotion like we wanted

2295
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,639
the work to speak for you

2296
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:15,279
and then people were like well [ __ ] the

2297
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:17,359
work i'll just say i have it

2298
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,880
yeah and then i'll get people believing

2299
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:21,039
it's i do

2300
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,960
right and you see my gold chain right

2301
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:24,960
you see my gold chain shows i did the

2302
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,719
work but you know honestly that type of

2303
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,079
thing where you go to like a cookies

2304
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,600
opening or something like that and

2305
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,079
there's various people standing there

2306
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,079
and like they you know they want to

2307
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:35,920
think like they want their breeder hero

2308
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,079
to be a baller

2309
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,560
yeah there's an aspect of that people do

2310
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:43,439
that because they're making money off

2311
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,639
the image of being a baller breeder

2312
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,678
yeah

2313
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:50,159
it's the car salesman mentality is most

2314
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:52,560
people want to be sold on something and

2315
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:53,759
be convinced that it's going to change

2316
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,679
their life

2317
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,440
and that way they can go then do the

2318
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,239
kardashian thing and show it the [ __ ]

2319
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,359
off and be like look what i [ __ ] got

2320
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:02,959
you know you know what you know it's

2321
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,359
fine i'll give you guys a good story

2322
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,158
that i heard the other day so one of our

2323
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:11,839
close friends um his his property almost

2324
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:13,198
burned down up in humble area and

2325
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,800
he he's

2326
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,799
he's a he's more rotund like me shorter

2327
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,039
and uh that [ __ ] was swimming

2328
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,560
across lakes to water his plants yeah

2329
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:26,158
rivers like a madman like and and this

2330
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,400
is probably one of the most successful

2331
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,399
people in our in our industry and he

2332
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,158
didn't think twice about going and

2333
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,079
jumping in a [ __ ] river to go water

2334
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:35,839
his plants daily just because it was all

2335
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,000
you know sectioned off he couldn't drive

2336
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,079
up there now that's and like i heard you

2337
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,679
say too like yeah if it's all done then

2338
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:42,800
i'll just grow my hobby girl and that's

2339
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,880
that like

2340
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,880
we don't stop but the

2341
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,199
people who love weed but it's not gonna

2342
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,480
stop ever the thing is

2343
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:54,960
is on that level right it's that the

2344
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,759
part that annoys the [ __ ] out of me

2345
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,439
is like the the way that they've

2346
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,119
you know it almost makes me like talk

2347
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:03,439
about like maybe i'll get on my soapbox

2348
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,279
here for a second and get pissed off but

2349
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:07,359
there's an aspect where it's to me it's

2350
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,679
not really been made legal

2351
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:11,519
it's been made like taxed and regulated

2352
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,560
right yes because

2353
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,239
like if it was fully legal then

2354
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,960
you know theoretically speaking let's

2355
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:20,879
say like all the money went out of it

2356
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,480
okay for whatever reason and all three

2357
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,159
of us on this podcast tonight i had to

2358
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:26,799
go out and get different jobs

2359
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,879
but if i could grow half my backyard

2360
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,279
with a bunch of different things from my

2361
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,920
seeds and make seeds and trade amongst

2362
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,920
other friends and enthusiasts and share

2363
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:38,239
cuttings and all that

2364
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,079
not commercially but just because we

2365
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,519
cared right yeah

2366
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:43,679
now you're talking about like the

2367
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,800
heirloom vegetable market before it got

2368
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,600
popular

2369
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,760
yeah

2370
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,440
when it was just a bunch of enthusiasts

2371
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,800
with going to like weird shows that

2372
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:53,198
nobody went to

2373
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,199
about wheat about about tomatoes or

2374
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:57,839
about zucchinis or about squash now it's

2375
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,759
all the rage heirlooms yeah but then you

2376
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:03,440
know think about how many decades those

2377
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:05,039
people kept all of those old heirloom

2378
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,839
you know varieties

2379
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:08,560
before the popularity came back

2380
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,039
so

2381
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,800
you know the way i look at it is like

2382
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,960
six plants is an insult because that

2383
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,560
means that you can't breed at home

2384
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,760
that's exactly what that means you need

2385
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,199
a license to breed weed you can't be

2386
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,960
real i mean if you're going to be a

2387
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,960
hobby breeder you can probably get away

2388
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,960
with it realistically speaking but like

2389
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,960
it's not legal

2390
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,039
where you can just like you know control

2391
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,719
the sale of it if you want

2392
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,319
yeah right but think about how much cool

2393
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,480
[ __ ] you could do there's a lot of

2394
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,000
there's a lot of weed people that just

2395
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:39,839
love wheat

2396
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and they would grow weed even if it

2397
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,679
didn't have a financial benefit

2398
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,039
like a summer garden

2399
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,359
yeah

2400
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:48,719
you know for for real but you can't

2401
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:50,319
because you can only have six [ __ ]

2402
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,639
plants so they want you to go to a

2403
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:53,599
dispensary and buy them

2404
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,600
yeah

2405
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,679
you know any breeder knows you can't

2406
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,920
crack six seeds and get anywhere on any

2407
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,960
kind of project you want to do

2408
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:05,600
no not really not if you really care not

2409
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,359
to make progress yeah not if you really

2410
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,440
care want to make progress no so it's

2411
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:10,559
not really like i've gotten to the point

2412
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,638
where i don't even really like

2413
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,880
discussing it is legal weed

2414
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:17,440
because i look there's no i'm i can go

2415
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,199
to the liquor store and how much money i

2416
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:21,439
have in my pocket i can buy as much

2417
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:23,119
liquor as i want

2418
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:26,319
yeah right i can buy

2419
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:29,198
booze beer i can buy dom perry on i can

2420
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:32,719
buy kegs and kegs kegs and kegs i can

2421
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:35,119
fill a whole garage in my house with it

2422
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:37,359
i can give it out to friends i can share

2423
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:38,960
i can throw a party in my backyard and

2424
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,639
have a hundred people over and give it

2425
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,119
away for free

2426
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,880
so like when weed it gets treated like

2427
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:46,639
alcohol or vegetables i'll start

2428
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,480
thinking of it as legal

2429
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,679
yeah i like what ring said right here he

2430
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:51,279
said the lack of cash has only

2431
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,880
reinforced how much everyone who is

2432
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,279
getting out of it was into it to begin

2433
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,560
with yeah we him and i have been joking

2434
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:58,158
about it actually because we don't we

2435
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,719
don't live very far from each other at

2436
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:03,359
all and we both moved to mendo when it

2437
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,840
was kind of like depressed and weird

2438
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:07,599
and so you saw this enormous green rush

2439
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,679
rush in for the money

2440
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,840
yeah and now as the money's been really

2441
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:14,719
hard the last two or three years you see

2442
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,679
like the reverse green rush

2443
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,039
where

2444
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,480
most of them didn't want to live there

2445
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:19,279
unless they could make a bunch of easy

2446
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:20,158
money

2447
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,679
yeah

2448
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:22,960
yeah for sure

2449
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:25,600
you know so

2450
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:28,239
humble oh my god southern humble isn't

2451
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,400
like in such bad shape right it is it

2452
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:31,198
makes me nervous like for the first time

2453
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:34,319
ever

2454
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:36,079
like i think the the triangle might get

2455
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,399
has been cut off to the point where it

2456
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,000
could actually suffocate

2457
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,479
yeah it's coming together right there

2458
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,079
trinity southern humble mendo the way

2459
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:46,399
that everything got built up the

2460
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:48,000
structure of how people cut deals with

2461
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,799
each other and grew weed and all the

2462
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,800
various aspects it's an enormous danger

2463
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,719
anybody see the dark horse breeding

2464
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,159
facility what the [ __ ] are they gonna do

2465
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:57,600
with that he buys all his seeds from

2466
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,359
breeders

2467
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,120
sorry i mean people might people might

2468
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:02,639
not want to know this or whatever and

2469
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:04,880
this might be dissing them or whatnot

2470
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,159
but i'll say it anyway darkheart is one

2471
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,319
of them and

2472
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:11,599
but there was a number of early

2473
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:13,920
nurseries that became nurseries because

2474
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,400
they were so bad at growing flower that

2475
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,560
their flower even in the 215 era was

2476
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:20,559
hard to move through anywhere

2477
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,679
and so when you're when you're growing a

2478
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:25,520
bunch of warehouses in the bay of b and

2479
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:27,679
c grade indoor

2480
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,560
like a few of these companies flipped

2481
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,239
into clones because that was just easier

2482
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,480
right because they couldn't grow good

2483
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:35,839
bud and then they take bad health

2484
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:37,599
practices

2485
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,639
and they spread

2486
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,320
viruses and diseases all over california

2487
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,440
before anybody had an idea of what was

2488
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:44,880
going on

2489
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,399
yeah speaking of which speaking of which

2490
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,039
let me plug this in real quick on

2491
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:50,319
september 9th we are going to be having

2492
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:51,679
um

2493
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:53,759
the people i'm not going to say their

2494
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,520
name because people just snipe everyone

2495
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,320
on shows i guess but

2496
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,800
um the the the foremost experts on the

2497
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:03,198
hopslate and viroid um doing studies out

2498
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,600
of peru and they're [ __ ] killing it

2499
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:06,799
so we're gonna have them on to cover

2500
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,800
and try to

2501
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,199
figure out all this [ __ ] and it's gonna

2502
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:14,560
happen it's gonna be a really cool show

2503
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:16,479
because there's a lot of of uh

2504
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,880
maybe we'll call it we've called it bro

2505
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:21,279
science yes uh there's a lot of

2506
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,039
ineffective sterilization ideas out

2507
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,719
there and there's a lot of ways that

2508
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:28,079
people don't understand how it moves

2509
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,760
around and how clean practices work and

2510
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,399
you know when we all got started in the

2511
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,560
90s you could have one razor blade it

2512
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,879
was like the most unprotected like

2513
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,719
carefree you basically use the razor

2514
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,800
blade until it got dull

2515
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,960
yeah and now it's almost like you want

2516
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,480
to be like a tattoo artist

2517
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,719
where you've got clean clean tools for

2518
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:51,279
every single every single tattoo you're

2519
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,880
giving so every single plant

2520
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:53,759
right if you really don't want to spread

2521
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,679
things

2522
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,480
you have to kind of take that sort of

2523
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,079
like

2524
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,319
that new approach

2525
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,479
yeah and we're still learning a bunch

2526
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,238
about it honestly

2527
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:06,158
yeah so i just wanted to put that in

2528
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,198
there it's it'll be an excellent episode

2529
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:09,039
and

2530
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,879
we'll try to uncover some of the myths

2531
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,198
going around like it being transmissible

2532
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:15,199
in seed if that's a fact if it's not you

2533
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:18,319
know there's all kinds of stuff

2534
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:20,879
i was working with a

2535
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:23,599
plant scientist from brazil

2536
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,079
on at a nursery in redwood valley last

2537
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,239
year and she was

2538
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,319
working on hops thyroid

2539
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:32,319
and other plants for quite a few years

2540
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:34,319
prior to getting into cannabis and she

2541
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:35,759
was saying that it was a 20

2542
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:37,039
transmissible

2543
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,039
through

2544
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,238
breeding into seeds

2545
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:43,600
in other

2546
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:46,079
varieties of plant species and so she

2547
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,320
was assuming that it would also transfer

2548
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:50,000
over into cannabis as well

2549
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,479
from what they've seen there's been zero

2550
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:55,279
transmission in cannabis as far as uh

2551
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,638
the cannabis species it was and and with

2552
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,399
hemp it was eight percent

2553
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,639
transmissibility or six or something

2554
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:02,079
something very low but in cannabis for

2555
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:04,480
some reason it's not they're not seeing

2556
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:07,039
any so we can hope that it's gonna stay

2557
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:09,678
that way or maybe it's just undetectable

2558
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:12,158
with what our tools are currently but i

2559
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:14,319
guess we're gonna see i mean a viroid is

2560
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:15,759
even tinier than a virus

2561
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,519
yes but you're really that's what makes

2562
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,440
it so hard to kill you're really talking

2563
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,960
hard it's not even like a living thing

2564
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:22,879
it's almost like a cult it's like a

2565
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,560
collection of it's like a little piece

2566
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,239
of data floating around waiting to

2567
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,560
attach to the right thing

2568
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:30,559
yeah um a district i just watched it

2569
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:34,520
this morning and the experts and they

2570
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,520
said eight percent so somebody

2571
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:40,239
did i hear correctly that um

2572
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:43,279
dark dark heart nurse or a dark

2573
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:45,919
horse yeah and not so trans drag dark

2574
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:47,679
horse for dark heart i did i did i said

2575
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,960
i was slow i i don't know what happened

2576
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,239
but that's where i went i'm getting i'm

2577
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,840
getting the facts from scientists

2578
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:52,718
district that's

2579
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,000
uh

2580
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,560
i heard they're going out of business is

2581
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,960
that correct oh i i did hear that but

2582
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,360
i'm not sure but yeah i did hear that

2583
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,119
okay yeah i wasn't sure i didn't know if

2584
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,359
that was a rumor or if that was for real

2585
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:08,000
or not they said they came up

2586
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:10,799
they said they came up with a cure uh or

2587
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,279
a treatment program yes um and then

2588
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,679
other you know other opposing nurseries

2589
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,599
bought plants from them and still had

2590
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,760
and still had the viroid

2591
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,800
well i mean they supplied the viroid and

2592
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,239
passed the vibroid massively so they had

2593
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,679
to come up with the solution so they

2594
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:28,799
could make money off it again and then

2595
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,920
it got [ __ ] yeah well then promoting

2596
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:34,000
that new um

2597
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,800
non-breedable clone stock

2598
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,800
yeah they're yeah

2599
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,880
kind of like like corn where

2600
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:43,119
all the corn farmers you can't breed

2601
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,440
that corn you gotta buy seed every year

2602
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:47,279
yeah because it's not readable and i

2603
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:49,039
heard that's what darkheart was doing

2604
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:50,639
they just announced that like a month

2605
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:52,560
ago well there's a yeah there's an

2606
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,880
aspect right now and i think this is

2607
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,719
probably going to be like a big deal in

2608
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,159
the next 10 to 20 years

2609
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,760
where like if you're gonna have this

2610
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:02,079
industry that's gonna be worth billions

2611
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,880
and billions of dollars nationwide

2612
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,639
they just can't accept that like

2613
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,279
all of these strains right now are

2614
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,440
basically open source

2615
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:12,800
people are going to want to lock that

2616
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:14,638
[ __ ] in

2617
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,840
and you're going to want to control

2618
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,199
things

2619
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,199
and they're going because you guys know

2620
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:22,399
everybody every breeder knows right you

2621
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:24,158
can make chili verde or nl5 haze or

2622
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:26,799
punchy blue whatever you know any any

2623
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:28,960
strange name as soon as you sell it it's

2624
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,279
out

2625
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,800
right and you don't control it anymore

2626
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,399
people can buy it from you people can

2627
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,039
make their own seeds people can sell

2628
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:38,960
their own seeds you know people could he

2629
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:41,519
you know he could make a deal with a

2630
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,840
nursery to like have verified chili

2631
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:46,239
verde and another nursery could buy a

2632
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,639
hundred of clones and grow up all those

2633
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,079
moms and start selling them and he has

2634
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,319
nothing to do with it

2635
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:54,479
so once you release things into the into

2636
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:56,399
the world they're gone

2637
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,479
oh yeah you know in that regard and so

2638
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:00,158
people don't like you know corporations

2639
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:03,678
and and big companies they don't like

2640
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:06,000
that they like like uh you know uh

2641
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:08,000
intellectual property if you will

2642
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,719
and so it's really weird because you

2643
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
know

2644
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,679
you know there's an argument where it's

2645
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,679
like there's companies going around

2646
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:15,760
right now trying to make like uh

2647
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,000
marketing deals with various collectors

2648
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,440
and breeders to get old stock

2649
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,119
yeah right and then that person would

2650
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:23,359
get kickbacks but who should get a

2651
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:25,359
kickback for it

2652
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:27,519
a lot of that time

2653
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:28,880
i've never seen anybody really be paid a

2654
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,560
kickback yet

2655
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,560
but i'm just saying like

2656
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,039
people are kicking around ideas but all

2657
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,840
that is all that's coming all that's

2658
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:39,439
going to try to be more standardized

2659
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,079
you know you know maybe i would've

2660
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:42,879
offered royalties on chili birdie

2661
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:45,760
through

2662
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,400
like dark heart a few other places

2663
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,520
and but it was on the stipulation that i

2664
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:51,039
had a

2665
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,600
state license

2666
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:56,158
and that i was then going to sell them

2667
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,079
the one clone first and then

2668
01:33:56,158 --> 01:34:00,158
from then they could give me royalties

2669
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,800
back on everything yeah but you better

2670
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:04,399
be licensed you better be licensed huh

2671
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,800
but that's what i mean right so let's

2672
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:07,839
say they make a deal with you and every

2673
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,239
clone

2674
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,920
that they sell of that thing they give

2675
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:14,319
you a percentage

2676
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,079
but i buy 500 clones from them and i

2677
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:18,399
take it to my nursery and i don't have

2678
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,399
any deal with that and i start selling

2679
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:22,479
thousands of clones of chili bear day a

2680
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:23,359
month and none of that residual goes to

2681
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:24,799
him

2682
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,079
yeah because i don't have a deal with

2683
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,920
him i just bought this thing from a

2684
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:29,679
nursery i don't owe anybody anything i

2685
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,199
own it now it's mine

2686
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,440
yeah you can suck it

2687
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,519
so that's been a problem the whole time

2688
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:37,678
and it actually is like

2689
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,440
back in the day it's it's to some degree

2690
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,118
why one of the reasons why a lot of

2691
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:43,198
breeders started not wanting to tell you

2692
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:45,279
what's in their work

2693
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:46,638
because they didn't want people to know

2694
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:48,559
that it's like they wanted it to be

2695
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,560
secret sauce because they didn't have

2696
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,400
any control over it

2697
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,560
once you release it

2698
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,479
it's out there it's gone

2699
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,920
you know in the last few seed sessions

2700
01:34:56,479 --> 01:35:01,039
that we've had

2701
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:03,520
seat swaps up in southern humble

2702
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:04,238
um i've seen an influx of people coming

2703
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,400
in

2704
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,559
that are from out of the area and they

2705
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,479
literally go and buy seed from every

2706
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,080
single [ __ ] person at the whole

2707
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:13,279
entire place

2708
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,439
and they buy

2709
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:17,279
everything of what that person has and

2710
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,198
then they walk out with a whole box full

2711
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:21,279
of seeds and i'm like

2712
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:22,960
that's not what you normally see

2713
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,800
yeah like you know what i mean

2714
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,719
yeah um because we've been running those

2715
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,679
swaps up there for a couple yeah that's

2716
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,920
an anomaly dude yeah three or four years

2717
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,079
we were doing these flops and then there

2718
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,760
was always locals coming in doing a

2719
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:37,760
little bit of trading maybe buying a few

2720
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,159
speeds here and there but nothing like

2721
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,239
that and then yeah last this last six

2722
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:44,479
months or so i was just watching these

2723
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:47,198
people come in and i'm like

2724
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:48,638
they're they're collecting for

2725
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:50,399
somebody big

2726
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,319
yeah what the [ __ ] you know one of these

2727
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:54,638
big farms out there that are just

2728
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:55,599
getting geared up to go to you know go

2729
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:57,440
public

2730
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,280
yeah

2731
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:02,079
but it's that it's that thing where it's

2732
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,759
like it we've got decades of i hope it

2733
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:05,519
all stays open source

2734
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,600
i hope it's pretty punk rock in that

2735
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,239
regard and it's like

2736
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:12,079
i'm not saying that like in the future

2737
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:14,000
they might not lock things in where they

2738
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:15,679
can put like genetic markers into

2739
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
certain breeding lines where you can

2740
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:19,679
tell it's from that but i basically

2741
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,880
think that like everything from the

2742
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:25,679
beginning of cannabis to 2018 or 19

2743
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,118
should be it's it's just out there

2744
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,880
yeah but

2745
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:30,799
honestly you know and it might be shitty

2746
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,639
for some people but it's like

2747
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,480
otherwise everyone's going to lock it in

2748
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,760
and control it and then people are going

2749
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:38,718
to that's that's what will happen is

2750
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,480
people get sued like monsanto you know

2751
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,198
right now the us is

2752
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:44,799
like gonna be one of the last like we're

2753
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:46,960
way behind because like if you look at

2754
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,199
like colombia right now columbia is

2755
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:51,920
already on the move to do that they're

2756
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:53,519
already looking at licensing and holding

2757
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,600
on to these genetics and calling them

2758
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,040
there and being set up for worldwide

2759
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,039
distribution

2760
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:02,960
and so

2761
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:03,840
the us is lagging and yeah in one regard

2762
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,359
um

2763
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,920
of

2764
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:09,920
being on top of licensing these genetics

2765
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,840
and we are we will stay open sourced

2766
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,560
here for a long time because of the lack

2767
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,920
of

2768
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,520
the government

2769
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,560
wanting to really

2770
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:20,560
open up ganja here i think the entire

2771
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,800
market in colombia

2772
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:27,360
is just kind of kicking around getting

2773
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,360
started hoping that america opens up

2774
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,039
that that's real i think i think that a

2775
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,480
lot of these people that are going to

2776
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:35,039
third world countries right now and

2777
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:37,678
these other places trying to set up shop

2778
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:40,399
are trying to have their roots in

2779
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:42,960
if it goes federal so they can im they

2780
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,879
can export from this place that doesn't

2781
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,639
have osha and doesn't have this and

2782
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,800
doesn't have that i think that's really

2783
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,319
what it is is that they're not down

2784
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,600
there to try to make a bunch of money in

2785
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:53,118
colombia

2786
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:56,000
like that's cool if it happens but

2787
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:58,158
they're hoping that our market opens

2788
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,600
yeah you know thailand's kind of

2789
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:02,399
interesting right now to see what's

2790
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:04,239
going on there because they've just

2791
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:05,198
opened up hemp

2792
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:07,759
and

2793
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:10,000
um they're letting everybody sell it

2794
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:12,000
just open them anywhere and there's no

2795
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
age limit on it

2796
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,920
but everybody's already growing ganja

2797
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,679
they're using like kind of how we did

2798
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,679
with the cbd thing

2799
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:20,880
they're selling weed

2800
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,239
as hemp

2801
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,199
and so

2802
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:26,399
but it's supposed to be for export only

2803
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:28,960
you're really not supposed to be

2804
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:30,479
consuming it and yeah so i'm kind of

2805
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,079
curious to see how that's going to go

2806
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:33,439
but i'm already seeing

2807
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:35,439
i've already seen

2808
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:37,519
two or three u.s companies

2809
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:38,879
feed companies that are already there

2810
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,960
and i'm like

2811
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,359

2812
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:46,319

2813
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,519

she lost her visa

2837
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:33,198
mostly because of what i do and who i am

2838
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:34,960
yeah

2839
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:36,799
and so they sent her back and i haven't

2840
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,319
seen her in almost three years but

2841
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,960
that's sad

2842
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:42,000
yeah and getting my passport was a

2843
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,880
nightmare

2844
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,118
um

2845
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,679
i had some problems when i was younger

2846
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:49,118
living on the border yeah and the first

2847
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,399
time i applied for my passport they

2848
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:53,118
denied me

2849
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:55,679
then they gave me coveted [ __ ] they

2850
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:57,759
got lost and so it took me almost two

2851
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:00,319
years to get my passport and i finally

2852
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:02,159
got it and now i'm ready to go

2853
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:03,599
but yeah now i just have to make a

2854
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:04,479
little bit of money so i can afford to

2855
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,119
go

2856
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:09,198
yeah finances moving up moving in in

2857
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:10,639
state moving in cities expensive as [ __ ]

2858
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:13,198
i can't even imagine moving out of the

2859
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:15,679
country how expensive that is

2860
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:18,479
yeah um i'm not sure if i can actually

2861
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,679
move full time because i have to go over

2862
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:21,039

dual citizenship

2867
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:33,119
and then i could move there but i

2868
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,118
wouldn't be able to stay there full time

2869
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,118
unless the thai government approved it

2870
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:38,319
and i heard that's kind of really

2871

happened

2908
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:01,520
um they can absolutely look through

2909
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,199
everything they want uh and then see if

2910

gold standard passport to travel around

2920
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:26,399
but we're not the easiest most welcoming

2921
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:28,319
place to get into for lots of countries

2922

especially in the last two three years

2923
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,479
it's gotten to where they don't

2924
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:35,198
they don't want to let anybody in

2925

2959
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:48,320
down too much but i'm one of those

2960
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,319
depressed kind of people already so it's

2961
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:51,920
like

2962
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:53,198
dude this far into the weed game if

2963
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,039
you're not jaded then you're not

2964
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:57,118
realistic with yourself i mean

2965
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,439
you know it's positive failure

2966
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:01,039
no matter what you do well you know if i

2967
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:04,158
was if i was

2968
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:05,600
more into being self-promoting and being

2969
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:07,279
one of these guys who who's on the

2970
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:09,280
internet

2971
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:10,960
like just blowing myself up and

2972
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:12,399
constantly

2973
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,920
being there

2974
