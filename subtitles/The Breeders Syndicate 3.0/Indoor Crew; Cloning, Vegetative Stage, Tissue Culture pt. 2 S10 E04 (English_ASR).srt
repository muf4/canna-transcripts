welcome to reader Syndicate 3.0 the next

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,678
evolution of the look into

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,039
counterculture that is Canon my name is

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,960
Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
started as a one-man mission for strain

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,160
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,559
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,640
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,320
techniques breeding science strain

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
history and more our mission is to

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
combat the Nar the corporate cannabis

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
and Seed posers are obus skating for

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,259
their own Financial benefit welcome to

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,840
the underground We Are The

18
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:43,039
[Music]

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,879
Syndicate this is a bit of a tangent

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,000
although Dan I think touched on it

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,039
somewhat um Matt what are your opinions

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,640
on like mother care I know it's kind of

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,679
like its own Topic in many ways but just

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,600
spend a few minutes on it what do you

25
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,679
mean like what what specifically um how

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
different is your approach to

27
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,558
treating like your mothers versus like

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,679
your plants that you know you're about

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,438
to maybe flower I mean one of the main

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
differences is you're not you're you're

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,599
completely training them differently you

32
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,959
know you're training them for clones for

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,000
the most part as opposed to for uh

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,759
something that you're going to flower

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,239
out so you're you're feeding it much

36
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,200
differently you're not feeding it the

37
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,719
heavy PK it's never going to bloom um

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,478
you give it a nice round regimen um a

39
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,640
lot of times what I'll use the moms to

40
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,959
do like seed seed plant moms is to make

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,560
seeds more seeds and clones and that's

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,798
about it um yeah I mean it's just it's

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,879
such a different mindset I mean

44
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,759
realistically like it's it's a lot

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,519
easier to run a a vroom of moms for

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,438
clones than it is to ever flower

47
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,280
anything because you know most of the

48
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,398
fuckups come in flower right everybody

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,879
can grow in veg pretty well for the most

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,280
part I'm curious as well this is more

51
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,158
the Practical side of things like do

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,320
people give them like less light and

53
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,799
stuff as well just because they don't

54
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,319
you know don't need as much or you know

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
are other things you can kind of like

56
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,758
skimp on yeah I mean you could throw

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,319
them under t5s and have them grow even

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,719
slower but still stay healthy there's

59
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,039
all there's a lot of different things

60
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,639
you can do to to maybe re quote [ __ ]

61
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,759
growth without without affecting it or

62
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,679
hurting it too much um when I was

63
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,959
running the 600 watt uh double-ended

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,120
cfhs um I would always run them at 300

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,360
like just to have strength because it

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
never needed to be more than that they

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,480
could stay healthy didn't they didn't

68
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,318
eat too aggressively that meant I didn't

69
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,359
have to do as much training as much

70
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,000
cleaning as much maintenance because

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,360
that's a that is the other side of it

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,719
like it's constant maintenance and

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,599
cleaning when you have a bunch of moms

74
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,318
in

75
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,919
room yeah yeah I guess if we wanted at

76
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,318
some point we could do a little episode

77
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,518
on like mother care sure yeah if you

78
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,280
guys want to see us do an episode on

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,000
mother care leave a comment below and

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,759
maybe maybe we'll do it even though I

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,080
[ __ ] hate grow

82
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,878
shows I'm still stuck on the fact that

83
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,920
you're a house and garden

84
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,719
boy yeah yeah I am I like I like house

85
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,839
and I like that the I met the owner of

86
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:15,120
House and Garden us and Eve dude he what

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,759
you know was it Steve Geer I'm pretty

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,799
sure was a dude in San Diego um who

89
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,679
owns hydroponic stores down there um he

90
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,719
owns uh uh uh what was it's like the

91
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,799
main hydro stores down there I'm totally

92
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,639
blanking right now but he also was like

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
the house and garden Duty always hook me

94
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,759
up so like I don't know man I'm very

95
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,919
very um I'm a little biased when it

96
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
comes to House and Garden because they

97
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,158
did treat me very well no matter

98
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,719
what but that's important to me I like

99
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,280
to be treated well by a company that I

100
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,719
support and you know I was nobody when

101
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,680
they were treating me well you know I

102
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,400
still am nobody and they treat me well

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,840
so it's kind of cool I used to buy cases

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
of shooting pwder H you know that's the

105
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,799
one product I've never used I've never

106
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,878
used shooting powder never have yeah

107
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,280
that's cool it works what is that it's a

108
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,078
bloom booster it'll like make your

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
flower it's it's definitely got some

110
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,239
pgrs of some sort in it because it makes

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,878
your flowers reset Bloom and so you'll

112
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,759
be in like week six and you'll get a

113
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,759
full flush of white

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,238
hairs whoa so what do you what do you

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
meant to use it for it's to shoot

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,198
instead of root like it's supposed to

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,520
convert the plant over from shooting to

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,840
rooting or rooting to

119
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,879
shooting that's the idea yeah got it's

120
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,758
just like enhance flowering and so you

121
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:34,038
can like up your yields like 10 15% like

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,520
adding a packet of powder to like a 50

123
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:42,800
gallon resz once or twice in week

124
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,799
six it works right just yeah I see I

125
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:50,160
see anything else

126
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,879
on uh veg in general any any any weird

127
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,120
stuff that comes to mind that people do

128
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,639
that you're like why um I I'll toss in

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,759
one weird thing like a lot of people

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,120
like I'll see it in forums um on

131
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,600
Instagram

132
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,478
when people see red stems they

133
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,879
automatically assume it's a deficiency

134
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,560
but there are a lot of genetics that one

135
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,800
of the traits is red stems so don't

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
assume just because you're seeing red

137
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,639
stems that it's a deficiency because

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,479
there are a lot of genetics that are red

139
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,400
stemmed um that's about it that's all I

140
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,000
care to have yeah I do get on every

141
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,560
single plant regardless so I assume it

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,478
may not be genetic but that's something

143
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,680
to eliminate too right yeah

144
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,318
yeah uh anything else from anyone local

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,079
any any last thoughts on this before we

146
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,080
move on to

147
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
cloning Lo fell

148
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,959
asleep uh maybe his mic's not working

149
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,879
again uh it's all right

150
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:52,120
um anyone else if

151
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:54,439
not hand it over to n because so kind of

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,439
similar to the germination one um I

153
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,279
think yeah like I said earlier ER just

154
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,839
does a really good job of like

155
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,359
accounting for the things he's scene as

156
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,560
he was learning and also also ER has

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,560
actually filmed a little cloning

158
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,839
tutorial for us and might be the first

159
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,079
of more maybe um this one that that we

160
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,918
will probably uh release next week or

161
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,279
something I don't know I haven't talked

162
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:20,478
to mant about it yeah is specific to

163
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,879
what uh he calls call or what we call

164
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,918
Callis Tech has a few other names but

165
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,680
anyway sorry that's just a way to

166
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:32,079
introduce uh Ern yeah for sure I mean

167
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,038
like I've So like um I've talked about

168
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,680
this in a bunch of different episodes

169
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,839
but or like bunch of different a few

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,959
different episodes but I have um tried I

171
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,879
tried dwc and stuff and you know I've

172
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,879
done those kind of things

173
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,079
so I've also tried cloning that way you

174
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,120
know uh

175
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:54,038
so cloners and stuff like

176
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,639
that um and like they they work

177
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:59,439
obviously they work you know what I'm

178
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:03,800
saying um but for me in my setup I just

179
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:07,120
found that um like the most consistent

180
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,280
way for me to clone and like cheapest

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,519
and easiest and just all around like

182
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,159
lowest maintenance like and it works

183
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,560
every time for me has been this callist

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,080
Tech um and you know the way that I

185
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
found out about it uh was through um

186
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,800
that slow

187
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,560
nickel on Instagram and and

188
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,720
basically when you cut your clone it

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,680
goes the end of your clone goes down and

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,759
sticks out the bottom of your Cube

191
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,360
that's it um and you just have this

192
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:39,199
clean dry area where the end of your cut

193
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
like the cut end can form a callus and

194
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,478
heal it and like you know close itself

195
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
up and it like keeps bacteria and

196
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,959
pathogens stuff like that from getting

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,439
up inside there and it just made sense

198
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,279
to me like I was like duh like if I get

199
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,800
a cut on my finger I'm gonna leave it

200
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,359
open to Air and I'm GNA let it like form

201
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,079
a scab and then it's going to heal you

202
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,319
know so

203
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,758
that was just made so much sense to me

204
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,520
so that's what I started doing um I I

205
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,280
tried I went through a bunch of

206
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,918
different um I've used a ton of

207
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,679
different like rooting hormone Solutions

208
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,318
you know I've used clonex I've used dip

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,478
and grow I've used the stuff they sell

210
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,800
at lows I've s you know whatever I've

211
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:24,199
tried it and um so now I've kind of

212
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,280
settled on using dip and grow just

213
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,439
because it's cheap it's I mean it's

214
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,360
super cheap it lasts forever and it's

215
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:34,278
and it works so I use it um and then I

216
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,360
use rock wool cubes because they're

217
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:39,879
cheap and easy for me to get and um that

218
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,639
I like the way that they dry back um I

219
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,480
think having dry backs is important for

220
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,519
uh like it's important for clones too if

221
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,800
you have your cubes soaking wet all the

222
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,440
time you know it's not going to be good

223
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:55,919
for the tissue so um yeah that's I don't

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,079
know how this you want to go I guess we

225
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,639
can Loosely say that dryb backs are

226
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,559
useful when you're trying to pressure

227
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,240
roots to grow right like that seems to

228
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:09,119
be a general principle um maybe this is

229
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,560
a good point to pass it to Dan just

230
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,078
because um Dan in your mind what are the

231
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,958
kind of other parameters that you should

232
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:21,159
consider when you are cloning um so er

233
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,919
obviously like just described a specific

234
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,439
piece of tick but what are you thinking

235
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:30,078
about when it comes to like you know

236
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,880
environment um yeah

237
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,799
yeah so um I've had two different types

238
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,720
of setups like most people that are

239
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,719
homeg growing are going to need to use

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,680
like a variety of different humidity

241
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
domes there's like the Mandi domes I

242
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,399
think are the most common ones that

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,839
everyone gets because they're cheap um

244
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,759
I've actually found some cool ones on

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,079
Amazon that you can get like stacking um

246
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,799
height extensions for which I want to

247
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,679
try out and just start taking like Mega

248
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,639
clones and stuff and they're like super

249
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,879
heavy duty plastic so you don't like

250
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,799
ever uh like I break those M does all

251
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,759
the time like the edges start fraying

252
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,439
and they can cut your hands up and um

253
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,720
same thing with like the 1020 trays that

254
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,480
um people clone in that's 10 by 20

255
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,360
inches um they uh um they break and they

256
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,560
rip they have rough machined plastic

257
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,278
edges and you can cut your fingers open

258
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,239
all day long if you work in a clone

259
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,278
house or a

260
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,519
nursery um but I've got a lot of

261
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,399
opinions on this [ __ ] because it was

262
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,480
like my first longest gig was like

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,559
working in um black market nurseries and

264
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,399
stuff and so I've tried literally all of

265
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,719
it you know like at scale and So like um

266
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,799
I personally like clonex I but I do

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,759
appreciate dip and grow as well it is

268
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,399
way cheaper and more cost effective and

269
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,958
it's alcohol based and so you're

270
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,039
actually kind of cleaning up that cut

271
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:49,679
Edge too um to a certain degree and

272
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,439
keeping that a little more um you know

273
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,958
like fungal and bacterial free um I

274
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,440
actually really like the AOC cloners um

275
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,278
especially when you're just doing like

276
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,320
big batches of single cuts um it's the

277
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,399
fastest way I've or I mean I've gotten

278
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,480
root Roots about the same speed in Pete

279
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,159
plus as well um but um the aroc cloners

280
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,800
are just cool man like I just think it's

281
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,600
a cool piece of tech they're like a

282
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,000
massive amount of work to keep clean

283
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,399
because you have to just like gut it and

284
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,440
bleach all the internals and um it's

285
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,720
just kind of a pain to run um but I had

286
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,680
really great success just rocking um

287
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,399
protect and kln from Dino and then um

288
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,078
there was a while back I can't remember

289
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,720
what the dude's name was but he was on

290
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,719
IG and he's the one that taught everyone

291
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,720
to use pool shock bleach in there it's

292
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,000
like the the bleach they use for um

293
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,399
swimming pools and stuff and um it

294
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,958
actually works really well if you have

295
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,600
the dilution right to just keep

296
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,319
everything really clean and um oh you

297
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,560
don't have to change out your water and

298
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,160
but you you sometimes you have to run

299
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,919
chillers with those too because the pump

300
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,159
makes heat and so you have to like burp

301
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,159
the excess heat out of them like they're

302
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,199
kind of a pain in the ass but they're

303
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,879
cool um but like as far as like rooting

304
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,600
media you have like the three main

305
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,320
options of like grodan Oasis cubes or uh

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,839
Pete plugs and so like Oasis I think is

307
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,639
like a plastic type material um but uh

308
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,720
you only see dudes from the triangle

309
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,480
using those like that's the only time if

310
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,519
I ever get clones from dudes in humbold

311
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,039
or mesino they come in a [ __ ] Oasis

312
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,560
Cube he use those in San Diego too I

313
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,480
like them yeah I like them too man

314
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,479
they're they definitely drain like free

315
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,120
drain the most fre like you know what I

316
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,000
mean you just tilt it on its side and

317
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,560
that water pours right out versus like a

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,759
groan a lot of times you have to like

319
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,799
stack a few of them and like drain the

320
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,039
water out and then flip it and even it

321
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,000
out um they're used a lot in like

322
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,319
traditional agriculture like I used it

323
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,679
when I worked at the flower shop and

324
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,399
stuff and that's how I was first aware

325
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,159
of them that they were even a product

326
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,600
you know yeah yeah and like they have

327
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,759
their own like compositional differences

328
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,320
I actually like Pete plugs the most if

329
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,720
you have like a what are they called the

330
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,199
riot are they are they the root riots

331
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,000
yeah yeah root riots mother root riots

332
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,838
they they have the most airspace and

333
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,679
like uh that I've seen in them and so

334
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,360
they sporing me by now for real for

335
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,638
real um but I like those the most I tend

336
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,879
to get Roots faster and just healthier

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,000
more vigorous Cuts with that media for

338
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,519
some reason um but I've also noticed a

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,958
massive difference in quality depending

340
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,679
on who you get them

341
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,759
from that's what I was gonna say yeah

342
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,319
it's they're

343
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,439
so yeah cuz like sometimes you open up

344
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,680
the case and they've got like

345
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
aspergillis like blue green molds and

346
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,319
[ __ ] growing all over them and you're

347
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,759
like huh I don't know if this was added

348
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,040
or if it's just growing because it's

349
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,120
like humid and sealed you know yeah yeah

350
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,278
that's what took me to rock wo was my

351
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,879
local uh hydroponic store has got those

352
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,799
root Riot cubes and I would get them all

353
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,759
the time and um they started just like

354
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,519
the shape of them it was like there was

355
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,079
not enough Peete in the cube like in the

356
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,360
mold you know what I mean like it was

357
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,958
like they didn't have enough stuff there

358
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,079
and then I got one batch and I opened

359
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,679
them up and they smelled weird I know

360
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,439
that's like super but I like they

361
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,000
smelled sour and I was like okay that's

362
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,160
not right so I just got rid of them and

363
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,720
then switched to rock wol just because

364
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,600
like I just never had that issue with

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,839
them and you know but yeah I don't have

366
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,920
a strong opinion on those two you know

367
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,240
yeah rock is really nice because I feel

368
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:30,159
like if you get the cube saturation

369
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,159
perfect um you don't have to water until

370
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,759
Roots

371
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,240
emerge yeah I don't I don't at all yeah

372
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,480
yeah and then at that point you're kind

373
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,879
of just vegging in the tray you

374
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,879
know but uh so that's how I kind of feel

375
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,360
Oasis cubes you definitely have to do

376
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:49,879
one to two small water editions like um

377
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,240
with those ones I would rock like um

378
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,519
grodan you can just put right into a a

379
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,680
1020 tray and you can drain off the

380
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,720
water put like a slotted tray um the

381
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,638
cube in the slotted tray and then the

382
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,480
that one inside the you know no holes

383
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,639
tray and drain off water that way but I

384
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,360
like to have perite underneath the Oasis

385
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,919
cubes um and that kind of keeps them out

386
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,440
of that water so when you're doing your

387
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,639
water additions they're not just like

388
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,279
completely submerged it Wicks up from

389
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,399
like a a nice you need a fine pearlite

390
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,639
though not the Big And Chunky stuff you

391
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:28,120
need like a number four number five and

392
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,959
um so you depending on the media water

393
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,759
the water scenario may be like

394
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,599
drastically drastically different so if

395
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,839
you're switching those up constantly and

396
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,839
like not adjusting other parameters

397
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
that's probably why like someone may be

398
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,800
having trouble like in their early

399
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,278
cloning issues also like the cleanliness

400
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,479
of the cuting that you're taking like

401
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,000
when you're indoor and you don't have

402
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,000
bug issues and you're on point with your

403
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,879
IPM it's not really a big deal um but if

404
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,639
you're taking cuts off of like outside

405
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,399
plants like that actually almost [ __ ]

406
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,440
me recently because I had bugs that just

407
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,039
came came from the environment and

408
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,959
almost like ruined my whole grow that I

409
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,759
was just starting and so it set me back

410
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,758
like three or four weeks of like having

411
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,159
to douse everything in Sulfur and like

412
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,879
let it grow back to healthy again and um

413
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:17,719
geez yeah it's so much easier to like

414
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,759
you can apply some like tissue culture

415
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Tech that we'll get into next about like

416
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,639
how you initiate cuting and so like that

417
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,959
involves like soaking it in a mild

418
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
bleach solution and then rinsing that

419
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,559
off and putting it in I've done that

420
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,198
when I was trying to save um other

421
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,278
people's genetic collections where they

422
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,599
had like rud AIDS and spidermite

423
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,198
infestations and all that and there was

424
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,959
just no way to do it other than like

425
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:44,879
literally soaking the cuts and bleach

426
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:47,159
before you plug them and um yeah yeah

427
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,039
it's it's

428
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,679
bad um yeah before we we move on to the

429
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:56,039
tissue culture section I want to see if

430
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:59,078
local local has any thoughts slash if

431
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:02,519
his mic is working now

432
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:07,359
cloning yeah my Wi-Fi kept disconnecting

433
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:11,558
sorry guys God damn it okay yeah umine

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,119
but anyways cloning um I gotta say uh

435
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,439
environment and plant Health you know is

436
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,838
really important um I'm sure these guys

437
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,279
touched a bit on that but um you know

438
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,318
right now for example um it's a new

439
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:28,639
house first winter not like a new house

440
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:32,119
but you know what I mean like a new spot

441
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,679
um new winner um and it's like I'm

442
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,399
getting used to the like temps of the

443
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,000
place um and it's just like ambient

444
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,480
temps are just way too cold um so I kind

445
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,160
of just

446
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,720
gotta figure out how to keep warm you

447
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,519
know um the space heater makes the room

448
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,120
too hot so even on the low settings I'm

449
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:59,079
might have to get a smaller one um so

450
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:01,479
we'll see but yeah just environment are

451
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:05,359
you keeping

452
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,360
warm yeah I got my two

453
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,240
cats yeah something I was going to throw

454
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,599
in there too that local mentioned but I

455
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,679
we didn't I don't know if we fully

456
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,599
touched on but yeah just like Mom Health

457
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,400
you know obviously that's important you

458
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,359
know the plant that you're taking the

459
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,960
cut from should be healthy um wellfed

460
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,599
you know like you don't want to be

461
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,600
taking cuts from like a you know we

462
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:34,399
plant you know I mean obviously you can

463
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,359
and you can try but you know if you

464
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
start with like the most healthy plant

465
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,199
to take cuting from that's going to set

466
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,199
you up for success as

467
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:50,479
well um yeah Matt anything to add to

468
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:54,558
that no man Mother Health everything for

469
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,480
cloning um and of course like with with

470
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,599
h the Hops and thyroid you know there's

471
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,480
a whole bunch of other techniques um for

472
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,319
cloning that a lot of people have kind

473
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,960
of started doing and I guess that all

474
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,960
changes on if you or hinges on if you

475
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,200
trade clones or bring in clones from

476
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,798
nurseries or whatnot but that's a whole

477
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,120
another episode and I think we covered

478
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,359
that previously in another season so

479
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,639
definitely check out that episode the

480
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,719
tissue culture one that we did

481
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,400
do or hlv episode that's what it was

482
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,240
yeah yeah yeah hlv

483
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:32,880
yeah yeah that's it okay awesome

484
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:35,279
um okay well Dan we can talk speak to

485
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,240
well we can invite you to speak to uh

486
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,558
one of um you know one of those topics

487
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,480
tissue culture as we have gestured

488
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,079
towards uh how did you want to start

489
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,679
this one what do you think might be

490
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,960
interesting for our

491
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,919
listeners um I think just kind of like

492
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,679
an overview of the process and then like

493
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,919
some of the different texts and like

494
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,759
phyto hormones involved in the different

495
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,559
steps that may be useful because you can

496
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,558
do this stuff at home you know I mean

497
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,720
there's all kinds of like home tissue

498
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,279
culture guys and home micology guys that

499
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,000
are working out of like invert like you

500
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,399
know they're literally totes clear totes

501
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,919
on their side you know and they spray

502
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
them down with alcohol and like you

503
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
don't always need a hood you just have

504
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:19,038
to be you know like mindful of what

505
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,798
you're doing and like maybe Dan one

506
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:25,558
thing here is like

507
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:27,839
uh are you able to kind of like indicate

508
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,720
like precisely which things can be done

509
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,439
at home versus things that like are

510
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,240
definitely not doable yeah I think I

511
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,038
think like we'll break it down into um

512
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,880
three sections is how I have it kind of

513
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,919
like broken down in my head is like

514
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,200
there's micropropagation there's more

515
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,919
Advanced Techniques like marem culturing

516
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,480
and like embryo rescue and a few other

517
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,799
like more theoretical ones that like

518
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,720
people don't use very often and then

519
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,240
like how people develop Sops and so I

520
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,079
think the only thing that might be more

521
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,720
Troublesome at home is like the more

522
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,319
advaned techniques because um you're

523
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,038
just dealing with cleanliness and

524
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,119
multiple transfers like every time you

525
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,679
transfer something at home is like or

526
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,639
even in a lab that's like when you're

527
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,600
going to contaminate it and so um it's

528
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,159
all possible to do at home though like I

529
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,158
know people that have done this [ __ ] in

530
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:21,440
just like garages and Tents in their

531
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:24,120
house and so um I hope you're dude like

532
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,200
hope you're I'm no expert in this either

533
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,439
like I did a senior year in a tissue

534
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,159
culture lab in college and been like on

535
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,159
the outside looking in and like talking

536
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,360
with people that are doing the research

537
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,200
and um uh I just kind of keep up on the

538
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,319
current topics and like the players

539
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,080
involved um just so I'm like you know

540
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,038
current with the times but like I don't

541
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,359
do tissue culture for a

542
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,798
living and so um I have a really close

543
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,119
colleague that would like he would could

544
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,839
speak to this like Leaps and Bounds but

545
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,079
um I don't think he wants to like out

546
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,639
himself or be very public um but uh the

547
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:02,599
main thing that like most people are

548
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,240
doing is just like multiplying cuts and

549
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,798
storing genetics and so that's just

550
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,839
micropropagation and so there's three to

551
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,679
four main stages of that and so like

552
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,839
your first one is just your mother plant

553
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,600
like your X vro in your grow room plant

554
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,639
and you have to take a cutting off of it

555
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,278
right and so to try and surface

556
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,080
sterilize that to the best of your

557
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:25,558
ability you soak it in a 10% bleach

558
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,278
bleach solution and you rinse that off

559
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,000
with um sterilized water which is like

560
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:31,679
something that you've put through like

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,679
at home it would be a pressure cooker

562
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,000
but if you have a lab and like work with

563
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,240
a group it'll be your

564
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,159
autoclave which is just a fancy pressure

565
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,558
cooker with more controls um and uh so

566
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,240
you have to rinse that off with

567
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,879
everything has to be sterile first off

568
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,400
so you're like you're working in a nice

569
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,120
clean environment with no draft ideally

570
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,480
with a laminer Flo hood and you can get

571
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,439
those I've seen them people are 3D

572
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,440
printing them nowadays and so you can

573
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,000
buy those on Etsy now for like 200 bucks

574
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,360
um and I've actually get a 3D

575
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,919
printer I have a friend that does 3D

576
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,839
printing that I work with and he's an

577
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,200
absolute G and so like I kind of want to

578
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,918
buy one and then like reverse engineer

579
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,840
it you know and make a better cooler one

580
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,120
or just a bigger one for myself you know

581
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,199
with the same

582
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:21,678
premises um but so I'll keep you guys

583
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,558
posted on how that goes but um so yeah

584
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,400
there's initiation you soak it and

585
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:29,639
bleach and you try and just get that um

586
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,038
into culture and it onto a gelled medium

587
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,480
it can be gelled with like a product

588
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,640
called gel xan or a seaweed product

589
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,159
called augur um and normally you don't

590
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,520
really need too many hormones to

591
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,760
initiate it because you don't really

592
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,319
want to root that plant right off the

593
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,359
bat you know what I mean you're just

594
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:50,119
trying to get it into culture and have

595
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,959
it be sterile and so um even if you

596
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,278
surface sterilize

597
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,319
properly there are a lot of like

598
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:57,880
parasitic

599
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,158
endophytes that just live in the plant

600
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,720
and a lot of them are bacteria and

601
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,880
you'll see these like milky white

602
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,440
contaminants that it like erupt out of

603
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,480
the cut Edge that's sitting in the gel

604
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,919
and um you can't really always stop it

605
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,120
and so like what a lot of people do is

606
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,640
they use antimicrobials in the media to

607
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,798
kind of make it look like they're doing

608
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,559
better than they actually

609
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:23,158
are um because we've seen it routinely

610
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,558
with the work that I've been like

611
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,080
watching one of my colleagues do is that

612
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,079
like they it happens all the time and

613
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:34,798
you can have it in vitro for um eight

614
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:38,519
months before it even expresses and so

615
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:41,359
um there's uh actually you can find them

616
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,278
on uh Google Scholar if you look up

617
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,839
cannabis tissue culture contaminants and

618
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,558
things like that there are some public

619
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,918
papers that have been published that um

620
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:52,000
have like categorization like visual

621
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,240
charts to like point you in the

622
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,119
direction of like what type of

623
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,278
contaminants you

624
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,278
have and then uh if you actually get

625
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:03,038
past that initiation stage then you go

626
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:04,480
on to stage two which is multiplication

627
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,919
and so at that point you're going to be

628
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,960
replating your initiated plant on a

629
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,720
variety of different cyto Canin

630
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,440
depending on like what your goal is for

631
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,240
that so if you're taking those and like

632
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,240
doing phyto hormone research and things

633
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,120
like that where you're just trying to

634
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,278
see what the plant's going to do um with

635
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,479
different additives and chemicals add to

636
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,000
it then you may not want to elongate it

637
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,079
that much it all just really depends on

638
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,319
what your goals are but a lot of people

639
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,319
are just looking to multiply plants and

640
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,398
so right now um there's this cool dude

641
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,639
called Connor Stevens who's a friend of

642
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,359
a colleague of mine he's out of uh

643
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Cornell University he recently started a

644
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:45,639
company called polymorphisms here in

645
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,480
California um which is a tissue culture

646
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,278
lab and like genetic preservation lab um

647
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:57,319
for the commercial industry here um and

648
00:25:51,278 --> 00:26:00,079
he identified 2ip publicly as the um the

649
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:03,759
most most productive cyto kind into use

650
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,439
for shoot elongation and multiplication

651
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,119
and so you can actually go and look up

652
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,558
his re research it was actually just

653
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,558
published

654
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,918
recently and uh from that stage you can

655
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,159
either send it off to more

656
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,640
multiplication on the same Media or you

657
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,640
can then take it and you can try and do

658
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,759
marem cultures on it some people like to

659
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,480
initiate on meristem some people like to

660
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:30,200
do it once it's already in vro um I you

661
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,038
know I don't really have a comment on

662
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,640
like which one's better but um uh if at

663
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,919
that point if you are rooting that's

664
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,559
when you would take it to the next stage

665
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,440
and change the hormones to something

666
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,119
like an IBA or an NAA which are the

667
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,000
active ingredients in products like

668
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:49,558
clonex and dip and grow and uh you can

669
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,119
root your plant and then wash that gel

670
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:55,519
off and take it XV and grow it um uh but

671
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,759
yeah there's I've been seeing some

672
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:02,440
really cool stuffff like using packo rol

673
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,720
um in cultures it has potent I I the

674
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,558
research isn't done so I don't want to

675
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,159
speak to it too much but it's cool you

676
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:08,720
can try all kinds of different phyto

677
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,760
hormones they're all available through

678
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,360
Sigma ald and all kind suppliers and um

679
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,879
that research is pretty still largely

680
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,278
unexplored like people are doing it

681
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,399
privately but um you're not going to be

682
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,240
able to read about it and so I'm very

683
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,959
interested in just doing very basic

684
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,720
research like that where it's like hey I

685
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,038
put this many plants under this varing

686
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,600
concentration of NAA versus IBA and

687
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,480
let's see what they do differently you

688
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:38,558
know it's super super basic research um

689
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,360
but that's how you like develop your own

690
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,839
Sops because nobody's really sharing

691
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,678
them and what I found is the publicly um

692
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,879
researched ones they're um published

693
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,559
that you can read they don't all work

694
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,960
the same and in all environments with

695
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,879
all plants a lot of them are done with

696
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,480
hemp which is not a onetoone correlation

697
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,640
with anything cannabis related for um

698
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,319
THC production and those types of uh

699
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,880
chemo bars or whatever you'd like to

700
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:08,678
call them type ones um and so uh I've

701
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,640
noticed that're they don't really

702
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:15,240
readily work all the time um but um the

703
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,600
way that you really develop these Sops

704
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,278
and like the model to think about it is

705
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,240
is you have to do

706
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,319
everything

707
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,000
um it's like basic research like plot

708
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,519
design and so like you'll have like say

709
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,159
I have like 12 plants and they're in or

710
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,359
let's say 16 they're in a 4x4 grid

711
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,840
they're all in their little petri dish

712
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:41,079
um I can have it a gradient of like IBA

713
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:44,359
on one side so like the bottom left is

714
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:47,119
uh you know like zero micro moles of uh

715
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:49,479
IBA so that's the control and then an

716
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,439
increasing quantity one micro five micro

717
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,798
moles 10 Micro moles and then on the

718
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,000
other access you have it um with like

719
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,079
NAA or a different phyto hormone that's

720
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,359
cool so you're actually using like

721
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:03,480
you're using kind of like the spatial

722
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,959
order to help you index like the

723
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,278
different yeah and then you can

724
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,919
everything in between on that axis is

725
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,960
the combinations of and so you can test

726
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,880
multiple chemicals and their effects and

727
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,399
the combination of their effects all in

728
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,000
one little experiment that takes square

729
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:22,319
foot that's that's really clever you can

730
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,880
even stack it vertically and go in a

731
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,439
third dimension too and add a third

732
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,600
phyto hormone you know like or a third

733
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,240
treatment yeah exactly yeah you you can

734
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,480
I don't know if you can take it to 4D

735
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,759
but I guess you could yeah you could

736
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,798
have this big huge grid and having it go

737
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,000
all the way up stacked um but yeah um

738
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,158
it's really fun I I really enjoy that

739
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,960
type of research just because people do

740
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,000
it and people don't share but I'm very

741
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,558
open with the information that isn't you

742
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,398
know like contracted away from you guys

743
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,599
that I can't share and so can I can I

744
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:01,199
pause you here just to invite questions

745
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,678
from anyone else at this stage um yeah

746
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,080
yeah like Matt local have you had any

747
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,038
any uh any interactions with any of

748
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,079
these kind of chemicals or experience

749
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,480
sure napoline acetic acid um indol atic

750
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,879
acid indc acid they're all basic rooting

751
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,960
different different types of rooting

752
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,720
hormones um but not in like Ager medium

753
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,600
stuff like that I've tried it at home

754
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,440
and been very very a big a big failure

755
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,319
at it because I wasn't like didn't have

756
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,120
a fully clean environment I was trying

757
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,480
to do it in the house with dogs and [ __ ]

758
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,959
so yeah um I don't have a lot of success

759
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,120
with tissue culture but I do have a lot

760
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,159
of failure uh dealing with tissue

761
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:41,719
culture people

762
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,600
sure I if anybody else has anything they

763
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:48,240
want to add loal anything on this yeah

764
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:52,398
not not much like direct experience I've

765
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,640
worked like um in collaboration with

766
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:58,599
Labs that that have done like TC and

767
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,720
[ __ ] so like I've seen it be formed I'm

768
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:03,319
familiar with the process and stuff like

769
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,159
that but I've never like done it myself

770
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:09,918
um but I'm definitely

771
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,840
interested um it's just it's a lot to

772
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,559
get into at once

773
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:16,918
um

774
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,319
yeah yeah what I've noticed is it it

775
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,919
kind of has to be a focus like a the

776
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,558
main course for someone and that's why I

777
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,720
haven't like deep dived it is like I

778
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,519
just I don't really have the time to

779
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,679
hang out in my lab and my base B for six

780
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,480
hours a day right now like maybe in

781
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,200
another year or two I can like start

782
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,399
going down that path but um yeah you do

783
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,919
need like a project right to frame and

784
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,278
constrain what you're

785
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,200
doing yeah yeah otherwise you're kind of

786
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,480
just holding and making a ton of plans

787
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,880
um but I I really am curious and what I

788
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,278
want to get into when I do build my

789
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,278
little setup is um uh getting into

790
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:56,519
embryo rescue because I feel like that's

791
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:59,319
going to be like one of the the key

792
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,839
things that's like if you have these old

793
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,638
seeds like what is the best way that you

794
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,558
could posibly do it like we were talking

795
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:09,000
about earlier and like the best way is

796
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:11,319
in the hands of a really experienced um

797
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,599
tissue culturist that has like done that

798
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:16,480
research and I don't personally know

799
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,918
that person and so um well I just sent

800
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
some off someone I just sent someone

801
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,960
some off to someone he's one of the most

802
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,679
experienced tissue culture people I know

803
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,360
of yeah um so he even he said like I I'm

804
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,120
not sure how far along this is but I'm

805
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,519
going to give it my best shot which when

806
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,119
he says that to me it tells me there

807
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,120
isn't anyone like renowned out there for

808
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,359
that specifics but I know if there was

809
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,000
there were so many breeders that would

810
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,319
pay good money to have certain old seeds

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,038
at least attempted to be popped you know

812
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,960
for sure well what I see is like people

813
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,879
always want to you have to like sell

814
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,600
plants and be the nursery right like

815
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,399
that's like the the profit motive to

816
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,879
like start a tissue culture lab and how

817
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:57,558
you get people to give you money to do

818
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,760
that project because it cost

819
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,519
insane amount of money to want to do

820
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,480
this sort of thing but at the same time

821
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,240
that directly gets in the way of people

822
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,240
wanting to give you their oldest stuff

823
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,159
that actually has provenance because

824
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,960
they think that you're going to turn

825
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,519
around and use it and profit from it and

826
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,679
sell it to other people maybe against

827
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,278
their wishes and so like I think there

828
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,559
does need to be room in this space for

829
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,038
someone that genuinely is just a

830
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:28,398
preservationist their little setup is

831
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,720
exclusively for genetic holding for

832
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:34,759
specific clients that doesn't ever sell

833
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,720
clones yep I agree that that'll be who's

834
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,278
trusted enough for for serious people to

835
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,519
trust them you know it would take

836
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,440
something like that yeah and that's kind

837
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,440
of going to be more the angle of like

838
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,558
what I want to do with my work is like I

839
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,120
don't need to make thousands and

840
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,319
thousands and thousands of plans I just

841
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,199
want an easier way to hold more good

842
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,200
stuff that it's like I don't have to

843
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,960
water it every day I can maintenance it

844
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,960
once a month you know

845
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,480
absolutely yeah I'm excited to see where

846
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:07,720
embryonic rescue goes I I there was a

847
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,599
lot of Promise about it just a few years

848
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,480
ago people making claims that they could

849
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,800
take any old seed and do it with it but

850
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,358
you know it's it's a lot more

851
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
complicated than just having an old seed

852
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,559
you have to have living cells in there

853
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,200
it can't be totally you know dry stuff

854
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,679
like that so before we get all the

855
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,439
questions um yeah you can't do it with

856
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,200
any old seed not every old seed will do

857
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,720
it takes living cells in

858
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:34,279
it man are you allow to

859
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,598
discl what's that man are you allowed to

860
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,679
disclose what you sent off or no nope

861
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,359
yeah nope nothing nothing about it not

862
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,240
to who

863
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:45,838
nothing not yet not yet yeah I don't

864
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,559
have anything old enough but I think it

865
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,759
is something that's like needed in the

866
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,279
community and needs to be Focus D I did

867
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,919
have another a kind of different angle

868
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,240
on this which is in your experience like

869
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,000
with tissue culture what have you

870
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,239
witnessed as like successes what have

871
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,679
you

872
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,879
seen uh like just as far as like

873
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:08,480
techniques and like what's common or

874
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,480
like I just I guess I just want to hear

875
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,480
about like some like some stories some

876
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,079
anecdotes um tell tell my story you know

877
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,519
that one don't you yeah yeah there's a

878
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,760
lot I'll I'll start like this there

879
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,599
there's a lot of scammers in TC and

880
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,560
cannabis and there's a lot of people

881
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,240
that have like the most Bas level

882
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,000
understanding and like accomplishments

883
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,639
in it that like want to sell courses and

884
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,559
sell you that they're this guy that can

885
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,598
hold your whole library and like they've

886
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,440
all popped up more recently they're all

887
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,960
pretty young cats and like I don't trust

888
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,639
any of them yeah like um I know people

889
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,240
that like do

890
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:53,879
this at like a a doctorate level and

891
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:55,559
they don't claim the things that these

892
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,800
other people claim and they've been

893
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,639
doing it with cannabis for years like

894
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,720
that research takes a lot of time and a

895
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:05,279
lot of effort and um I don't think that

896
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,959
it's like hidden knowledge to any extent

897
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,400
like marem culture is just marem culture

898
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:14,679
um if you've worked in any TC you've

899
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,240
probably done it on other plants um so

900
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:19,000
um it's definitely totally all possible

901
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,838
it's just like whether those people have

902
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,880
actually put the leg work in to um teach

903
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:27,318
you how to do it and how to optimize for

904
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,680
what you're going to interact with in

905
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,400
the real world versus their like like

906
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,960
there's always one plant that does what

907
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,920
you want it to do right like I may be

908
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,720
like rooting a dozen plants on the same

909
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,200
media and one will always like do really

910
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,879
like pretty well unless it's like some

911
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,358
weirdo [ __ ] media but if it's just

912
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,039
like a run-of-the-mill like Ms media is

913
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:50,559
like the most common one um then like

914
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,559
there's going to be something that that

915
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,440
responds well to it but the rest won't

916
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,440
you know and so that's what I think is

917
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,358
happening is that these people find um

918
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,559
one uh uh recipes and methods that work

919
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,799
for one plant in particular their little

920
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,039
like model research plant so to speak

921
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,119
for their grow and then they teach that

922
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,519
to other people and they're like yep

923
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,720
it'll work every time you know how do

924
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:20,960
you pronounce the MS word oh merage and

925
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:25,598
SK scoo I can't I don't know I like mer

926
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,800
mer and SC yeah yeah how do you spell

927
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,160
that it's like a Japanese name and then

928
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,318
like like a Scandinavian name like

929
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,399
Mig something weird yeah oh yeah yeah

930
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:38,239
yeah I see I always wanted to hear

931
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,519
someone pronounce it who actually knows

932
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,000
how to pronounce it but I don't know

933
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,440
anybody who knows how to pronounce it

934
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,559
yeah I have to like look it up and if I

935
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,800
read it I think I can say it but yeah

936
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:53,759
look it up Mur it's like Mur and or

937
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,519
scooch yeah yeah yeah there you go there

938
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,119
you go that sounds better than my migi

939
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,920
and scoo

940
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,400
yeah I add there that's not

941
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,880
there but that's like all science words

942
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,599
honestly like depending on where you go

943
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,680
to school people like like there's no

944
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,280
accents in English right it's just like

945
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,118
there's a common way to like say

946
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,079
something and so um people will throw

947
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,680
like the accent so to speak in the

948
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,599
weirdest parts of like long like multi-

949
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:24,559
syllable scientific words and I think

950
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,119
it's so funny because like um uh like

951
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,039
heterogenous heterogenous yeah you know

952
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,640
what I mean like people that I've heard

953
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,199
that said like four or five different

954
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,519
ways you know what I mean from like

955
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,480
professional teachers and stuff like

956
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:39,759
that you I don't know if it's cannaboid

957
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,920
or cannaboid I don't know which more per

958
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,520
I think it's cannaboid but I I don't

959
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,599
know yeah cannabis no when it when it

960
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:49,000
comes to ination like that that that is

961
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,680
very much like a local thing I think a

962
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,440
regional thing yeah the British and the

963
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,879
Americans if you look at like three

964
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,000
syllable words the British and the

965
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,960
Americans just just like don't do it the

966
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,838
same yeah yeah like

967
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,318
aluminium

968
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:08,759
aluminium Alum it's not even spelled

969
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:12,119
that way

970
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,480
[ __ ] yeah just like for us is it do

971
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,920
you guys spell it different to yeah we

972
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,760

general any broad advice for newbies I

1010
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,800
think we this is pretty

1011
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,880
comprehensive yeah I'd say so for for at

1012
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,599
least this far I think we covered it

1013
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,640
pretty

1014
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,680
well yeah like we said can can probably

1015
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:02,078
break out into like specific things like

1016
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,960
we talked about mother care and you know

1017
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,280
there probably a couple of other things

1018
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,599
um actually this is probably a good time

1019
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,800
like if if there are things that you

1020
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:15,760
want us to cover um please leave

1021
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:19,039
questions in the comments uh because we

1022
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,359
read them all I read them

1023
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:25,800
all I find it so hard to come up with

1024
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:27,719
new ideas sometimes so yeah we need help

1025
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,480
yeah and some stuff like it you know

1026
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:32,159
like I've covered it in past episodes

1027
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,159
but only so much and like sometimes I'll

1028
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,159
feel like okay that's covered no need to

1029
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,480
do it again but maybe we didn't cover it

1030
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,598
that well maybe there's stuff that you

1031
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,719
would like us to talk about so

1032
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,640
definitely leave that in the comments

1033
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,118
too because I just assume it's covered

1034
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,279
[ __ ] it we're done well the other thing

1035
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,079
is that people don't a lot of people

1036
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,599
don't go back like if if we've got new

1037
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,519
viewers or new subscribers a lot of the

1038
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:57,359
time people may not actually go into the

1039
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:59,960
archive and just kind of pick it up but

1040
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,719

lot there's some there's there's some

1042
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,480

1043
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:09,279

lot too and I know I think there was a

1060
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,598
common comment that was like how many

1061
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,640

1062

1063
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,400

00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,039
from California Valley Southern

1071

California Valley I get to say like [ __ ]

1072
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:12,000
them

1073
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,880
all and by proxy you guys all get to do

1074
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,400
it too I actually knew someone who would

1075
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,440
like end his sentences with like I could

1076
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,639
see that yeah I know people who do that

1077
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,679
I had a

1078
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,078
friend I had a friend who would end

1079
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:30,558
every sentence with a question like are

1080
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,960
you oh yeah are you are you sure like

1081
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,839
he'd say something and it would just

1082
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,119
every everything came off is totally not

1083
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,199
confident because everything sounded

1084
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,480
like a question it's really you want to

1085
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,159
go to the store a lot yeah New Zealand

1086

does do this a lot the infliction goes

1087
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,799
up at the end it's to kind of like not

1088
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,960
not seem too assertive or too aggressive

1089
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,240
I think H yeah I can see that with the

1090
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,920
personality of this person yeah for

1091
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,639
sure I had to stop myself when I was

1092
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,760
like there was like a period of time of

1093

that I'll put it in the description it's

1134
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,639
a really cool one for for newer Growers

1135
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,799
especially but you know for anyone um

1136
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,159
they've got their own Vibe and it's it's

1137
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,680
sweet um probably the other thing I'll

1138
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,719
point to is that by this point when

1139
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:55,000

1140

1143
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:07,318
good reveals in part two uh I believe so

1144
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:10,759
um things not well known that weren't

1145

get off your

1170
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,838
chest um just want to shout out my new

1171
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,119
uh reversal sprig directly competing

1172
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,880
with yours yeah that's right that's

1173
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,280
right listed on your site yeah be listed

1174
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,440
on my site farmer D's reversal spray

1175
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,440
right to Riot's ex Ral spray yeah no

1176
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,318
realistically realistically what what

1177
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,720
I'd like to do if because Dan's doing

1178
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:37,800
really good work with reversal stuff and

1179
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,279
he's actually doing really good

1180
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:44,039
experiments and if his does turn out to

1181
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,000
be more effective than mine in a like in

1182
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,838
a more General sense as far as applying

1183
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,519
to more plants then we will definitely

1184
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:51,639
carry farmer Dan and we'll be doing

1185
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:54,239
something with it because it's just the

1186
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,078
most most important thing to me isn't my

1187
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,558
spray it's that people get the the most

1188
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,920
effective spray for the best dollar

1189
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:00,760
because that's really what's about in

1190
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,760
the end you know and I think Dan's about

1191
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,880
that

1192
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,240
too yeah I'm kind of stoked on that I'm

1193
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,880
GNA be trying to just like specialize my

1194
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:10,719
stuff in the future too like that's kind

1195
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,000
of the goal is like it's like hey this

1196
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,318
is the OG spray you know like this is

1197
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,880
the Z spray this is the you know like

1198
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:18,318
whatever but it's like we haven't quite

1199
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,559
gotten there I've got like a nice

1200
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,639
General spray but no no actual

1201
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,559
commercial intentions just yet you need

1202
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:28,400
you definitely need a spray you need a

1203
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,640
spray for like lady TP um lady potency

1204
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,318
type uh strains like Skittles and and

1205
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,239
Tangi they they need their own special

1206
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,279
spray because they don't get people high

1207
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,799
so they need special can't say lady

1208
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,800
potency

1209
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,400
