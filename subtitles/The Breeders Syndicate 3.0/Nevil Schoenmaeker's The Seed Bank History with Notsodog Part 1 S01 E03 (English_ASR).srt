1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,839
ready go

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:30,958
[Music]

3
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
welcome to breeder syndicate

4
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,359
there it is

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,719
we are here

6
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,000
how you doing bud

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
fantastic

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,480
let's just start rolling man

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,960
all right so uh this is the first

10
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,718
edition of our new thing

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
i don't know where we want to begin i

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,480
thought

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
maybe

14
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,279
this

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
thing would be good to talk about like

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
some some seed bank history

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,759
yeah the

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
you know obviously like now uh there's a

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,039
lot of stuff that's kind of coming out

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
of the woodwork where people are talking

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,000
about a lot of famous old cuts from the

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,520
80s and 90s seed lines and all that

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,280
and i thought that like there was a

24
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,359
bunch of people that

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
didn't uh maybe didn't know some of the

26
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,519
history behind all how all that occurred

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,438
uh and so

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,759
obviously since its weed history it's

29
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,239
not entirely exact but this is

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,438
everything we're gonna talk about is

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,640
the best that we know it right so

32
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,078
there could be some different

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,599
information not everything could be

34
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,839
entirely correct but we're going to give

35
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,158
it our best shot to give you

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
uh what we think and what we know and

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,439
all that right

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
that is correct

39
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,599
so that's the word so

40
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,798
the reason why we wanted to start with

41
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,959
um

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,079
like sort of neville and sort of holland

43
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,078
history

44
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,399
uh is it's that's not where like seed

45
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,239
history started obviously like there was

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
stuff going on in california there was

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,798
sacred there was plenty of private

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
breeders

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
but

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,478
in

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,640
holland

52
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,039
that was sort of the first place where

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,399
you could literally be a nobody and just

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,959
send them money and get seeds right yeah

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,639
but kind of in california at least from

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
my knowledge and experience you kind of

57
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
had to know somebody you kind of had to

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
be connected a little bit

59
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,119
um you know you had to be within certain

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
circles

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,719
uh for instance you know i grew up in

62
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,479
the midwest

63
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,878
and there was no access to seeds there

64
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,399
was no culture or anything like that so

65
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,159
the only places that we knew how to get

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
weed were dead shows

67
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,840
and holland

68
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,958
um and so you could mail order from

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,878
holland you could uh you could fly out

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,878
there and buy them direct and kind of

71
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,239
try to bring them back yourself

72
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,359
so

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
to me

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
that's kind of where like modern weed

75
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,719
history as far as like most people's

76
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,878
access to it begins

77
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,959
yeah if you were in certain circles if

78
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,518
you were in the pacific northwest i mean

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,039
you know obviously it starts before that

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
but um

81
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,719
neville

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,400
put an ad in high times in 84 or so and

83
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,959
that started what matt's holding up

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,560
right now is his 85 catalog

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,199
um and because hans

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,719
because holland's laws had changed then

87
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,479
they were sort of the first place that

88
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,560
could like really make

89
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,238
seeds available to everybody

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
right

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,799
so as a result of that

92
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,719
like that's where a lot of people got

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
most of their seed stock

94
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,080
it wasn't from connections it wasn't

95
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,039
from friends that those were small

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
groups

97
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
uh you know neville

98
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,359
uh sssc

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,719
um you know a couple other small places

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
they allowed

101
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,639
everybody people from florida people

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,280
from chicago people from new york people

103
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,759
from north carolina virginia

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,598
wherever to just if they had the balls

105
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,759
to go there they had the balls to order

106
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,639
it they could get it

107
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,798
right

108
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,719
and so that's where

109
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
that's where kind of like our modern

110
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,560
story starts and that's where like a lot

111
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,639
of uh

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,479
a lot of seed strains and a lot of lines

113
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,518
that became famous to everybody like

114
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,919
haze

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,719
northern lights skunk one

116
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,919
g13 maple leaf all these things we talk

117
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,519
about now that have become kind of

118
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,680
legendary

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,759
it's really where like 99 of the

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,918
population really first started getting

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
access to it right

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,959
um and so neville is kind of unique

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
in cannabis history

124
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,560
in that he had the balls to start it

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,240
and he sort of got to as you know by the

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,918
mid 80s persecution in california and

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,639
america in general had really kind of

128
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,039
ramped up it was the reagan years

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,120
drug laws had gotten intense

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,960
and so a lot of a lot of breeders and a

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
lot of growers and a lot of guys with

132
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,560
seed they sort of took what they had and

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
they fled

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
uh to amsterdam

135
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,638
right and so amsterdam basically got

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,960
famous because it was able to collect

137
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
a lot of stuff that was going on in

138
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,239
america not so much stuff it was it had

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,918
itself

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
but really stuff that was going on in

141
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,359
america

142
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
they did do some trips it's certainly

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
true that

144
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,879
uh neville

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,199
the drunkers from scentsy other people

146
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,399
you know some people went to afghanistan

147
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
there was [ __ ] that they called

148
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,478
obviously the hippie hashish trail where

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
people started going to the far east and

150
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,359
poking around looking for seed stock and

151
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,159
stuff

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
and uh but holland is really where it

153
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,320
consolidated like matt's holding it up

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,399
right now if you look on the left page

155
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,279
that he has up there's like an order

156
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,439
form

157
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,000
right and you could literally write down

158
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,839
what amount you wanted of what strains

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,839
and you could send them [ __ ] money

160
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,799
and they would send you seats

161
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,399
and uh that was pretty revolutionary i

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
think because that had never happened

163
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,839
before

164
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,800
you couldn't just ask a stranger for a

165
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,359
bunch a bunch of illegal marijuana beans

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
and get a hold of them back then

167
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
right

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
and so we thought maybe

169
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,918
it would be good to start like on a

170
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,639
historical basis because

171
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,758
most of the stuff that we grow today in

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
some way

173
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
there's a lot you could trace a lot of

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
it back

175
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,960
to that first five or ten years in

176
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,400
amsterdam say like 85 to 95 right yeah i

177
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,638
think matt would agree

178
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,799
absolutely that the vast majority of

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
today's modern cannabis you can at least

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
tie some of it

181
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,879
back to that era

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,600
most of it definitely yeah you know and

183
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:35,839
so neville did two things right neville

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,000
had the balls to start and then secondly

185
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,719
he was kind of able to collect a bunch

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,680
of people's previous work

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,919
like for instance mel frank

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,199
jim ortega

189
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:52,560
seattle greg from the nl crew

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,560
um mel you know uh sam skunk man

191
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,918
various groups like that and then his

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,519
own travels

193
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,478
and so he kind of became the first

194
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,478
person

195
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,439
to be able to blend all those things

196
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,519
together

197
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,839
like before him nobody was crossing

198
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,519
skunk in northern lights because the

199
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,119
skunk crew and the northern lights crew

200
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,159
didn't know each other

201
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,079
nobody was crossing an l5 you know with

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
haze because those that crew didn't know

203
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,240
each other

204
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,240
yes in a way he got lucky

205
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,680
because i mean like imagine today for

206
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,759
instance

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,879
you could collect nobody knew

208
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,000
about kush nobody knew about cookies

209
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,439
nobody knew about sour nobody knew about

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
all these things that are famous in

211
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,879
america and imagine you got to be the

212
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,800
person that blended them together first

213
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,240
and then sold and then resold them to

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
people so

215
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,639
like that's kind of like what um that's

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,079
kind of what neville got to do in a

217
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,598
sense right is yeah he got to be first

218
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,199
you know and a bunch of people copied

219
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,839
them and a bunch of people came along

220
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,400
and added their own thing and obviously

221
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,679
like just like every other breeder

222
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,000
nobody started [ __ ] right everybody

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,598
on the shoulders or who came before him

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,519
so you all pick up

225
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,360
you know the breeding projects and the

226
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,120
clones and the seeds as you get into

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,280
weed as you come around

228
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
and then you know you kind of add your

229
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,959
own kick to it and that's what every

230
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,918
breeder has done you know from the

231
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
beginning

232
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,719
um in some cases the first breeders in

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
say like america

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,560
uh were taking

235
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
all the import lead like the colombian

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,598
and the panamanian and the thai and the

237
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,800
mexican and all that and all that stuff

238
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,838
came in

239
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,918
uh from seed you know seeded weed

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,320
so literally every time you bought weed

241
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,199
you got free seeds

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,360
and so most most breeding in america was

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,158
a bunch of sativas

244
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
right

245
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,838
because that's all there was with

246
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,080
sativas like if you got hash

247
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,720
hash was afghans but you didn't find any

248
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,040
seeds for the most part

249
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,800
i think this this this is a really super

250
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,360
important part too because most people

251
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,679
that are around today don't realize that

252
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
the the influx of modern afghanis and

253
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,399
stuff happened more in the 80s late 70s

254
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
early 80s as opposed to have always been

255
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,799
existing and always a part of the

256
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,720
culture

257
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:15,120
yeah it it changed i mean most i would

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
say for instance that like most

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,919
most things that people were growing in

260
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
the 70s

261
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,679
was a blend of sativas

262
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,838
yeah because that's what that's what

263
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,559
everybody had access to right

264
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,480
so

265
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,799
you know it'd be mexican colombians it'd

266
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,959
be mexican colombians and thais it'd be

267
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,599
all these type of things and

268
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,000
afghans were super [ __ ] rare like

269
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,959
really rare um because somebody had to

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
go to afghanistan or pakistan or one of

271
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,399
those regions

272
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
get seeds and they had to go in the 60s

273
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,399
and 70s when travel took a long time

274
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,079
right they had to go they had to collect

275
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,159
them and they had to smuggle them back

276
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
into america either mailing them or on

277
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,519
their person somehow right

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,720
so but there was literal tons and tons

279
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,039
and tons

280
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
of mexican and colombian and thai and

281
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,599
panamanian and all these different

282
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,519
jamaican that was coming in in you know

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
in bricks and stuff to america and it

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,278
was all seated

285
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,839
so you know uh that was kind of like the

286
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,360
and so as a result of that most american

287
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,760
breeding was like

288
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,000
in core groups right

289
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,000
it was just little groups of people

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,839
friend groups extended friend groups

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,799
that type of thing

292
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,680
you know

293
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,278
uh and you know so

294
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,078
that's kind of how it started and it

295
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,120
really

296
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,838
i mean it really wasn't until holland

297
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,399
that most of america got access to like

298
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
a what a lot of little groups of people

299
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,278
were up to doing

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,639
you know um obviously like prohibition

301
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:45,600
was pretty heavy

302
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,199
so

303
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
you know you just there was no way for

304
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,440
you to know what what seattle greg and

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
the nl crew was doing in

306
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
the pacific northwest they were trying

307
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
to avoid getting busted

308
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,719
yeah and they were and greg's commented

309
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
several times that it was just like

310
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,639
watching dominoes fall constantly

311
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,719
watching their friends be popped it was

312
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,720
sketchy and so as a result of it being

313
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
sketchy and you trying to be underground

314
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
right

315
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,639
that meant that most people didn't have

316
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,078
access to what you were doing because

317
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,399
they didn't want most people to know

318
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,719
what they were doing they had to in

319
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,720
order to be successful you know there

320
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,639
was there was you know some stuff going

321
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
on in mendocino county and humboldt

322
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,000
county

323
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,360
and you know santa cruz and the central

324
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,200
coast area that was mountainous

325
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
and you know people were getting away

326
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
with pretty good-sized things and

327
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,919
breeding and stuff

328
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,839
but unless you were connected to those

329
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,078
crews if you lived in nebraska if you

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
lived in florida if you lived in you

331
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,838
know chicago like where i was born or

332
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,519
anything like that you had zero access

333
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,079
to those people

334
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,078
you had no idea whatsoever what was

335
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,039
going on you just had you know if you

336
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,799
were lucky you got some imports so

337
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,039
the reason why we thought

338
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,639
uh starting with neville and starting

339
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,000
with the seed banks

340
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,440
is because

341
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,039
neville was really

342
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,480
neville was probably one of the biggest

343
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,078
reasons why

344
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,839
we're all here

345
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,078
uh he sold

346
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
between he had when he started the seed

347
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,519
bank

348
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,039
you know he sold millions of dollars

349
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,600
worth of seed millions of dollars

350
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,319
yeah all over america

351
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,079
all over and so what he did is he gave

352
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,360
thousands and thousands and thousands of

353
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,120
people the ability to grow their own

354
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,919
and the ability to get some of the best

355
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,600
american genetics that were happening

356
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:36,958
that people didn't have access to before

357
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,959
so you know in a way

358
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,240
you know he kind of took

359
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,278
a lot of very famous weed characters and

360
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,759
he made their stuff famous

361
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,078
you know is really kind of what happened

362
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,039
he made it yeah that's he made some rock

363
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,479
stars

364
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,319
you know so i was talking about it

365
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
before and if anybody was listening to

366
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,639
like uh you know the first breeder

367
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,278
syndicate uh interview

368
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,240
uh matt matt and kansa got to interview

369
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,759
um

370
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,919
uh seattle greg

371
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,159
and one of the things that seattle greg

372
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,120
said in that interview was that

373
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,240
you know

374
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,399
he sent uh neville a whole bunch of nlc

375
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,360
because he saw that advertisement that

376
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,639
neville put in that in high times

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,879
he literally

378
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,839
you know reached out to neville

379
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,799
and um you know he sent neville northern

380
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,639
lights

381
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,399
um and

382
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,600
you know within five or six years of

383
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,278
that time

384
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
uh everybody in the northern light crew

385
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,879
has gotten busted

386
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,078
um and it would have been lost a time

387
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,399
and nobody would have known anything

388
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,239
about it other than some legends

389
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,360
um but he had gotten it to holland

390
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,320
before they all got busted and lost it

391
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
right

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
so

393
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,600
um

394
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,959
you know there's a there's a thing when

395
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,399
people are asking questions i haven't

396
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,159
gotten to the questions yet because i've

397
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,159
just been kind of rapping about stuff

398
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,519
but

399
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,958
there's a button where you can people

400
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,120
can go and they can ask questions and

401
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,719
we'll try to get some of those questions

402
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,639
answered a little bit later after we

403
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,959
roll through some of this [ __ ]

404
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,480
um and so

405
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,879
you know i'm i'm in my mid-40s so

406
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,519
you know literally like i said before i

407
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,078
knew how to get seeds i knew how to get

408
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,519
good lead from grateful dead shows

409
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,278
and holland

410
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,720
and uh i went to holland in 1994

411
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,439
and uh

412
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,360
you know i was able just as an 18 year

413
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,000
old nobody to just walk into various

414
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,759
places and buy seed stock

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,839
you know i didn't know anything about i

416
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,759
knew barely anything about growing weed

417
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,000
i literally got my first seeds that i

418
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,919
had access to because i could buy a

419
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
plane ticket and i could fly to

420
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,519
amsterdam as a kid

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,240
and i could buy seeds and i could bring

422
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,519
them back to my spot we could pop them

423
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,039
and uh

424
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,720
we could see what's up

425
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,319
was it still super expensive for the

426
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
time like

427
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,240
you know like modern times comparatively

428
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
how were the seed prices back then when

429
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,198
you first flew over did you have to save

430
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,920
forever or

431
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,078
so the funny part about it is is that um

432
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,759
seed prices like when you look in those

433
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,120
old catalogs

434
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,278
yes right now

435
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,720
in all honesty you know you see a lot of

436
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,720
stuff for 50 bucks 80 bucks 150 bucks

437
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,560
200 bucks ever

438
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,639
you have to realize the way money works

439
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,919
right now um

440
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
like i'll just give you guys for an

441
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,879
example of inflation

442
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,799
in 1994 when i turned 18

443
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,399
20 back then

444
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:35,120
would be worth 38 dollars today

445
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,600
so seed prices have stayed amazingly

446
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,320
stable over the decade they really have

447
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,519
they haven't jumped because if you think

448
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,240
about it most if you were selling seeds

449
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,480
at what neville was selling seeds for

450
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
most seed packs should be between two to

451
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,360
four hundred dollars

452
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,198
yeah yeah um just just even to equate

453
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,199
how much actual money neville was

454
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,399
getting for selling those seats

455
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,758
right

456
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,360
and so

457
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
you know they've stayed pretty stable i

458
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,759
mean obviously there's something there's

459
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:08,479
cookies uh there's some uh when skittles

460
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,120
came out there's some people that really

461
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,639
profited off people's availability

462
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
um

463
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,519
and uh

464
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,519
you know they've charged you know 500

465
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
800 a thousand dollars a pack for

466
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
certain beans but

467
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,800
um

468
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,519
you know see prices for most things like

469
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,879
if you buy stuff from csi or you buy

470
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,278
stuff from

471
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,679
uh riot or you you know other good

472
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,320
breeders that uh you know we like like

473
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,799
shaw and different people um they're

474
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,000
amazingly competitively priced

475
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,799
uh comp you know to today so

476
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
um

477
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,078
that's kind of like the

478
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,399
that was kind of a long-winded way to

479
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,919
basically say this hour or some chin

480
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,039
change or however long we decide to

481
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,879
shoot the [ __ ]

482
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,639
is basically about

483
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,320
like maybe giving some people some

484
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,680
information about how neville got

485
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,000
started and how he collected things

486
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,239
and then how he started blending things

487
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,360
and then how those things sort of became

488
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,599
like

489
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,759
the bedrock of

490
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,558
modern cannabis

491
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,359
right

492
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,918
um

493
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,838
because he's the guy that really took it

494
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,319
from very few hands relatively speaking

495
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,958
to crowdsourcing it if you will to use a

496
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,038
modern term where all of a sudden a ton

497
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,038
of people had access to it

498
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,759
right and i don't think that would have

499
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,160
happened um without

500
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,359
neville and some others and holland and

501
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
all that so um

502
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,479
maybe

503
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,519
that's sort of the uh

504
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,960
that's sort of the beginning

505
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,038
you know um

506
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
and we can kind of walk it through so

507
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,919
matt right now is holding up the first

508
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
actual real seed catalogue which has a

509
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
bunch of cool pictures of neville's

510
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,359
afghanistan trip

511
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,678
um you know he's holding a bunch of

512
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,558
sheesh he's hanging out with people in

513
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,000
the tribal regions of afghanistan

514
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:04,160
and um you know so basically when when

515
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
neville first started

516
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,759
uh

517
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,400
he didn't know [ __ ] of what he had

518
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,400
right there it is yeah he really did he

519
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,798
didn't know anything that he had he was

520
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,559
just collecting stuff from people right

521
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,440
and he was starting to blend to those

522
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,720
things

523
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,798
and i would say

524
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
it probably took him about three years

525
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:27,839
or so of [ __ ] around

526
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,759
um 85 84 85 86 going into

527
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,319
before he really started to figure out

528
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,359
like what he had and favorites of what

529
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,119
he had

530
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,439
and then kind of like

531
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:42,079
88 89 90 um that's really when like the

532
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,240
blend started happening that ever that

533
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,199
got made really famous like if you look

534
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
in

535
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,640
um

536
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,679
if you look in the book the very first

537
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
book

538
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
um

539
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,038
you know in the northern lights

540
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,798
greg and those guys sent him like

541
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,839
northern lights labeled one through

542
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,400
eight

543
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,399
but he you weren't able to buy an l1

544
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,720
from him you couldn't buy nl2 you

545
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,880
couldn't buy nl anything you bought a

546
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,919
random assortment of nl that he had

547
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,799
because he hadn't had time to like you

548
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,640
know he inbred those things line by line

549
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,038
but it took him a few years to really

550
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,038
figure out what he had or then grow

551
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,200
rooms in the stuff and even see what was

552
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,119
in there you got to realize too that

553
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
like to him

554
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,038
these are just names that are coming in

555
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,798
from these different growers

556
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,240
um you know we have a lot of knowledge

557
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,798
about what these things are supposed to

558
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
be now but he didn't have any

559
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,960
so in the first couple years there was a

560
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,159
bunch of there was a bunch of stuff in

561
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,480
there that's weird uh in for lack of a

562
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,360
better term you know there's random yeah

563
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,558
nepalese by skunks you know colombians

564
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,798
by this

565
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,558
african two

566
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,720
yeah you know there there was just a

567
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,639
bunch of stuff because he was sort of

568
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
reselling

569
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,520
uh

570
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,079
everything you know everything that he

571
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,839
had and he didn't really have uh

572
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,240
he didn't really have a way to

573
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,240
differentiate that you know so he was

574
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,839
just experimenting so

575
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,679
you'll see a lot of weird things in

576
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,720
there like there's a page

577
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,000
um you know yeah he's got some some thai

578
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,720
by

579
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,720
by uh afghani you know new mexico

580
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:30,158
again like skunk won by

581
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:32,720
by nl9 i think or nl8 um he had mazar

582
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:37,200
mizzari that he got from his travels to

583
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,200
afghanistan he had nepalese

584
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,839
root or alice it was kind of just a grab

585
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,279
bag in the beginning

586
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,038
of

587
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,399
just whatever whatever you know he was

588
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,759
kind of collecting from all these

589
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,519
different breeders right and um

590
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,759
so uh

591
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,759
you know they um

592
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,519
you know and you know and and also just

593
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,440
to go back for a second just to give

594
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,319
people an idea so he was collecting all

595
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,679
that

596
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,960
uh greg mcgregor seattle greg sent him

597
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,038
uh i believe

598
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
nl1 through eight

599
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,079
uh according to neville

600
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,000
um and greg and uh you know

601
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,319
who keep david watson who people call

602
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,960
sam the skunk man he had gotten in

603
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,678
trouble a couple of times and so he

604
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,600
took a bunch of seed stock from himself

605
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
uh and then some from some other

606
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,158
breeders and he brought that to holland

607
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,440
and he ended up selling it to

608
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,799
uh neville

609
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,960
uh in selling it to uh

610
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,279
the owner of positronics

611
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,558
um

612
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,599
huh bernard bernard yes positron the

613
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,000
owner of positronics bernard um he ended

614
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,519
up just basically you know he had a

615
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,640
couple kids or whatever he was kind of

616
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,319
broke-ish

617
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,559
um and he ended up going out there and

618
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,119
he gave neville skunk one

619
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,000
and hayes from himself

620
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,959
and then he was friends with mel frank

621
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,798
and mel frank had given him afghani one

622
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,200
and durbin poison

623
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:11,359
um and then another breeder in the bay

624
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,159
who we don't know his name had given um

625
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,158
some some other afghans

626
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,880
and stuff like that and so

627
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,080
85 86 neville was basically just

628
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,400
reselling

629
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,158
a bunch of stuff that he was collecting

630
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,360
a bunch of different breeders that he

631
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,960
had gotten

632
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,798
that's kind of the beginning

633
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,079
well um let's let's

634
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,000
let's start going over some of the base

635
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,439
lines that came out of the the seed bank

636
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,558
era some of the base lines that we see

637
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,960
in a lot of modern cannabis lines today

638
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,960
all right so maybe we'll start

639
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,720
maybe we'll start with uh something

640
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,600
simple like northern lights

641
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,000
yeah so like that if you look in the 85

642
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:52,399
catalog and you look in the 86 blog

643
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,720
not sure maybe even the 87 but my memory

644
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,720
fails me slightly i think you really can

645
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,640
just buy northern lights

646
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,120
yeah this one says cannabis indica

647
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,400
northern lights in the 86 and in 87 it

648
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,479
just says cannabis indica northern

649
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,120
lights as well just as northern lights

650
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,319
so he got it in 80 he placed that ad an

651
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,558
84. he got the seeds sometime in 84.

652
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,678
it's not we're not exactly sure when

653
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,000
yeah

654
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,400
he kept he started growing them out and

655
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,558
he started keeping the lines separate

656
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
and interbreeding them right and so if

657
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,440
you guys send to

658
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,000
the podcast with greg mcallister uh

659
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,759
seattle greg as we like to call him and

660
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,079
um

661
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:36,798
you know he basically said that like

662
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:38,558
you know the nl1 and the nl2 and the nl3

663
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,599
those were all pretty predominantly

664
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,759
afghan

665
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,278
they were rated by height and length of

666
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,359
flowering time

667
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,240
and then most of the other

668
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,639
most of the other nl's were those couple

669
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,880
afghans either one or two

670
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,240
blended with basically every sativa they

671
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,360
could get their hands on hawaiians

672
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
um

673
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,119
you know

674
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,599
colombians thais

675
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,119
mexicans so it was really a hodgepodge

676
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,119
and

677
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,879
greg has mentioned that they were really

678
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,119
scared to keep notes

679
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,440
uh and they were really scared to like

680
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,000
lay out exactly what they were doing

681
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
so a lot of those lines are kind of lost

682
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,159
to time

683
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,480
in terms of what their exact makeup is

684
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
uh because those guys didn't even want

685
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,599
to keep track they were just trying to

686
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,720
find good weed right

687
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,079
so yeah

688
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,319
some of them is a mystery but if you

689
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,038
look in those first few catalogs like i

690
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:37,599
said before you can find you know uh

691
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:40,640
skunk one by nl9 you can find um

692
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,798
you know five by eight if you will

693
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,520
you can find a bunch of different things

694
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,278
and he started reading them together and

695
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,119
combining them

696
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,038
you know in various in various different

697
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,918
ways and even in the beginning right

698
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,400
like

699
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,159
um everybody's familiar most people are

700
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,759
familiar with what he ended up using

701
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,000
which is one of the things that became

702
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,640
pretty famous which is nl5 by nl2

703
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
um but the first year he offered it he

704
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,679
reversed it and he and he and it was nl2

705
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,240
by nl5

706
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,640
uh because he hadn't really decided yet

707
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,640
on like what

708
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,880
you know what worked for him

709
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
so after a few years of [ __ ] around

710
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,159
with nl

711
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,639
he basically realized

712
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,880
that um nl1

713
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,640
bred pretty true to itself it was pretty

714
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,880
close to what we call

715
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,278
steve murphy afghan

716
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,880
which is basically the afghani that sort

717
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,519
of got the nl

718
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,240
uh line on its way he got these afghan

719
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,079
seeds from this guy named steve murphy

720
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,440
who wrote a couple cannabis books in the

721
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,918
mid 70s

722
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,600
and this was sort of a wide-leafed

723
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
short squat

724
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,798
kind of bubble-like

725
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,599
um lowland afghan

726
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,960
leafy frosty resinous

727
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,038
short

728
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,200
quick flowering thick

729
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,038
dense that type of thing

730
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,798
and then the nl2

731
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,038
was

732
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,038
you know more of a cush type it had

733
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,640
thinner leaves

734
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,679
one thing that people should know is

735
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,679
like afghanistan has an enormous amount

736
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,080
of height variation depending on where

737
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,480
you grow so some of the stuff like the

738
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,480
mazars and some of the regions might

739
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,720
only be like one or two thousand feet

740
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,798
above sea level but then when you get up

741
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,558
into like the hindu kush region the

742
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,720
hindu kush region

743
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,879
is the second highest mountain range

744
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,960
next to the himalayas and a bunch of

745
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
those afghan farmers were growing at

746
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,159
like 6 000 8 000

747
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,678
feet these big tall valleys in the

748
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,278
middle of nowhere

749
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,640
and so those leaves

750
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,960
were kind of much skinnier much thinner

751
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,679
um think about like everybody's pretty

752
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,240
familiar probably with like the way that

753
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,798
like what modern kush looks like and

754
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,120
it's like that skinny three leaf

755
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,759
um you know with different nugs

756
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,278
um where like the lowland afghans were

757
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,319
sort of like thick

758
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,278
feathery

759
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,759
um denser looser

760
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,919
more more leafy nugs like matt's holding

761
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,278
up in the picture right there right

762
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,320
so

763
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,679
i think it's 89 is it 89 the first

764
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,278
catalog matt

765
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,840
where all of a sudden

766
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:24,319
he had figured out which

767
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,639
nl's really worked for him

768
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,960
which ones were stable which ones gave

769
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,640
him good breeding work and after getting

770
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,278
all those nl's

771
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,880
all the nl's pretty much disappeared

772
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:40,159
okay from neville's catalogs except for

773
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,679
he offered nl1 f3

774
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,919
he offered nl2 f3

775
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,919
okay

776
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,038
and then he found

777
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,278
he grew up a bunch of five and since

778
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,000
five is so famous maybe we'll chat about

779
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,038
that there's this dude named kirby who

780
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,319
uh

781
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,359
um

782
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,398
who took

783
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,678
uh steve murphy's afghan and he crossed

784
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:08,398
that to a hawaiian which he said was a

785
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,399
colombian by mexican right

786
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,639
and um

787
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,199
you know and he gave that to greg and

788
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,038
greg sent that seed line out as one of

789
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
the one through eight we'll never

790
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,000
neville grew a bunch of that out

791
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,038
obviously if you're growing a bunch of

792
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,599
afghan

793
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,720
by colombian by mexican you're gonna get

794
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,319
a bunch of

795
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,640
uh a variety and chaos okay

796
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,359
so he found this one maybe if you want

797
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,080
to show that one nl5 pick again

798
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:40,319
yeah let me find it so within

799
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,319
the seven within the first few years

800
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
he grew up a bunch of this nl5 and most

801
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,840
of it was a chaotic mess

802
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,200
uh

803
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,639
afghani sativa blend all over the place

804
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,360
but that picture that you guys are

805
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,919
seeing on the left he found this one he

806
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,599
called it like a throwback plant right

807
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,520
and he found this one plant that was

808
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,199
almost pure afghan

809
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,879
super frosty super resinous didn't taste

810
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,558
like much

811
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,000
super low terps

812
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,158
um but it uh it had great structure it

813
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,519
had a great buzz

814
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,320
and uh he loved it and so i think by 88

815
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,000
89 90 the only thing that neville was

816
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,319
really breeding with

817
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
was you could buy nl1

818
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,278
you could buy nl2

819
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,359
and he had one cut that matt just showed

820
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,440
of the nl5

821
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,278
right yeah you got to realize for a

822
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,519
second that

823
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,159
in america

824
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,119
guys they didn't have neville's an l5

825
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,039
cut

826
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,199
they sent neville a cut

827
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,240
of their favorite but theirs was a

828
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
hybrid

829
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,839
theirs was that

830
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,558
blend it was an f1 hybrid of steve

831
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,519
murphy afghan by colombian and mexican

832
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,200
right

833
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,599
and so

834
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,558
and so you know there was there's a lot

835
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:01,359
of confusion about nl5 and we have this

836
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,398
thing that we call pre-pre

837
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,240
where

838
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,158
a lot of people like to like to talk

839
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,240
about how they have seeds or they have

840
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,320
cuts like from the earliest possible

841
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,839
time that you could have the cut

842
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,720
but people need to people need to

843
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:18,319
understand that there was always

844
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,319
um there was a north american cut of nl5

845
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,319
that was an afghani hybrid of with

846
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,278
sativa and there was a cut that neville

847
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,519
found

848
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,278
amongst the seed line that is that

849
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,278
picture right there that looks super

850
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,159
afghan and super frosty

851
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,919
right

852
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,799
and so

853
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,440
um by 88 89

854
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:41,200
almost all the nl you're gonna get is he

855
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:45,919
used nl1 and nl2 as males

856
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,000
and nl5 was always the this the female

857
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,880
and that was pretty much it

858
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,200
after three four years of breeding with

859
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,600
nl he had decided that most of the

860
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,000
sativa most of the hybrids that were

861
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,480
with sativa that greg had sent were a

862
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,960
[ __ ] mess and hard to breed with and

863
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,000
didn't breed consistently right

864
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,480
and you got to realize too that back

865
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,038
then during the high prohibition times

866
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,720
people wanted consistent producers

867
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,319
yeah

868
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,000
he used to joke

869
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,119
that if he gave you some kind of white

870
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,720
hot fire but it yielded 10 percent less

871
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,759
you'd be pissed

872
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,558
yeah right

873
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,759
and so most he found that like most pure

874
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,079
afghans

875
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,000
didn't cross very well together

876
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,278
um they liked being crossed with that

877
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
was one of the he was one of the first

878
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,278
people that really realized

879
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,038
that when you start crossing things you

880
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,640
start getting really neat stuff when you

881
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,960
start crossing things that are totally

882
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,440
unrelated to one another

883
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,079
so people should realize

884
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,080
there never was an nl5 line that was

885
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,599
ever released pure

886
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,119
that's super important as well because

887
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,119
we see that all the time people popping

888
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,879
up with nl5 saying they have the nl5 cut

889
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,000
or nl5 seeds

890
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,640
so

891
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,440
you know the the nl5 cut that was made

892
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,759
famous because people were buying

893
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,278
millions of dollars worth of hybrids of

894
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,200
it really

895
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,159
that was in europe

896
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,960
you know and you know greg has stated

897
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,039
that

898
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,600
by the late 80s they had all gotten

899
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,079
busted and lost all their [ __ ]

900
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,158
right and they didn't really share very

901
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,798
much greg told us that they had shared

902
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,080
the eight a cut of the eight a cut of

903
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,398
the nine

904
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,439
and a few friends they had shared the

905
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,678
five

906
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,080
but that wasn't the super afghani five

907
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,240
cup neville shows in those pictures that

908
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,480
was the f1 hybrid that was colombian

909
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,839
mexican and afghan

910
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,960
right

911
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,158
so

912
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,558
um

913
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,440
everything that nibbles sold

914
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,158
was an nl5 hybrid

915
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:53,600
he had nl5 by nl2

916
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,799
he had nl5 by uh skunk one he had nl5 by

917
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,839
hayes

918
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:01,440
uh can you think of any more matt

919
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:04,079
um as far as nl5 crosses mm-hmm

920
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,120
five hayes and all five by two i think

921
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,639
that what was the other one nl5

922
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,199
one

923
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,960
those are the three most common right

924
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,159
yes

925
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,038
you know a lot of people are talking

926
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,919
about having pure nl5 well that'd be

927
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:22,000
really [ __ ] hard

928
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,600
because greg says that they lost it all

929
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,720
by the late 80s

930
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:29,199
and then neville never sold pure nl5

931
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,399
uh there and and by pure

932
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,720
uh to be clear he grew out a lot of the

933
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,599
seeds that greg sent him and most of the

934
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,558
nl5 line was a mess and he found this

935
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,798
one afghani plant he liked a lot

936
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,079
and that's the one he used

937
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:44,960
so

938
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,798
uh

939
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,759
you know you see a lot of stuff you know

940
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,398
i see some comments you know uh talking

941
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,759
about bodhi stuff and all that and it's

942
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,918
tough because

943
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,720
i'm not here to like you know call

944
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,240
anybody out or anything like that or

945
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,679
obviously there's a lot of people making

946
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,359
a lot of claims

947
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,440
um but

948
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,879
you know that's part of the issue and

949
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,960
that's part of the reason why we wanted

950
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,679
to do these podcasts and these talks is

951
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,720
because most of the history is oral

952
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,679
right it's not written down very well um

953
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,480
even the people that were there disagree

954
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,720
exactly on what happened yeah

955
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,679
right there's some consensus but there's

956
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,918
also

957
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,760
uh there's also some disagreement and

958
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,759
some of these alzheimer's they don't

959
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,919
like each other

960
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,599
they're just flat out

961
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,279
they have beefs and they have disagree i

962
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,519
mean it's not very different than today

963
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,960
right there's breeders today that don't

964
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,759
like each other and they have beasts

965
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,838
with each other and

966
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,520
then 20 years from now they'll be

967
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,519
legends about both

968
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,039
right and they'll be like oh i thought

969
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,239
matt ryan was a piece of [ __ ] he's a

970
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,759
[ __ ] this and that i don't believe

971
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,838
him at all and then there'll be other

972
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,679
people who will be like well matt riot's

973
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,599
story was consistent this other guy's

974
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,760
story wasn't consistent

975
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,880
and most people aren't there

976
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,160
right

977
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,480
and so what we're trying to do with this

978
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,598
is just kind of lay out some like basic

979
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
facts

980
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,760
right

981
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,880
and uh

982
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
yeah and

983
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,640
i can actually comment on the bodhi uh

984
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,319
in all five thing because i was we were

985
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,159
talking during that time a lot you know

986
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,400
we've been close friends for a long time

987
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,000
and in his goal with the nl5 no he knew

988
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
that l5 was never released piers the

989
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,719
seedline however we were trying to find

990
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,799
something closest that we could

991
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,799
find and he was like he was trying to

992
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,320
find it and and consulting all his

993
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
friends too saying hey where do you

994
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,920
think the best nl5 seedling would be

995
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,519
that would show the best representation

996
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,920
and at the time there was like dr

997
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,358
atomic's northern lights um which was a

998
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,519
supposed claimant to the nl5 you know uh

999
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,000
lineage and then there was bc seeds

1000
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:50,800
which was the more popular one that had

1001
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,119
had been around probably

1002
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,960
accepted as as closer to northern lights

1003
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,880
than most that was available at the time

1004
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,159
so that's what he went with and and i i

1005
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
agree it was probably one of the better

1006
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,559
options at the time but as far as a pure

1007
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,880
nlp seedling when you break it down it's

1008
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,880
that's really hard to find

1009
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,000
because it never because the only people

1010
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,559
that had it

1011
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,320
you know and by pure let's be clear the

1012
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,400
initial nl5 seed line was an

1013
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,200
unstabilized polyhybrid

1014
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,880
yes

1015
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:23,199
it was a mixture of mexican colombian

1016
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,920
and and afghani

1017
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,399
right it was never stabilized it was

1018
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,358
never pure it never br it never bred

1019
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,200
true

1020
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,400
right it was a full-on polyhype

1021
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,480
oh and that's right squirrel mentioned

1022
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,440
the nl5 skunk one yeah that's correct

1023
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,480
yeah

1024
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,320
nl5 i i mentioned i think neville sold

1025
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,280
nl5 by two

1026
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,880
nl5 by skunk one yeah

1027
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,480
by hayes

1028
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,880
um and so but nl was always the

1029
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,679
nl was always the mother plant

1030
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,280
yeah

1031
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,838
i'm sure most people know this but i'll

1032
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,800
say it anyway just in case

1033
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,279
is that the way we talk about seeds is

1034
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,760
the mother should always come first

1035
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,560
and the father should always come second

1036
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,839
correct you talk about five by two he's

1037
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:15,920
using the mother of nl5 and a dad of nl2

1038
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,920
right uh some people get it flipped

1039
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,000
around and that's hella confusing

1040
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,000
because it is important to know

1041
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,599
what's the mom and what's the dad it

1042
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
really helps to have consistent

1043
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,400
terminology when you're chatting about

1044
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,440
seeds

1045
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,200
um

1046
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,639
what about the noof cut

1047
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,559
so

1048
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,799
you know there's things where it's like

1049
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,320
i can't you know

1050
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,160
when we're talking about kind of seed

1051
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
history and stuff like that this is all

1052
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,920
stuff that's going on in the 80s and the

1053
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,440
early 90s

1054
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,119
um and then

1055
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,039
you know these these things get

1056
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,720
legendary status

1057
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,199
and then they pop up in different

1058
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,679
generations and by different people and

1059
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,838
different seed companies in holland

1060
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,598
different seed companies in

1061
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,799
later in canada

1062
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,730
they start

1063
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,160
they start popping out and

1064
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,760
[Music]

1065
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,559
i can answer that one actually real

1066
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
quick

1067
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,358
yeah so

1068
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,280
uh there's there's somebody asking

1069
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:13,039
question about nl5 seed from todd uh we

1070
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,240
know quite a bit about that

1071
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,719
uh the basic story is that

1072
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,759
greg says okay

1073
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,879
that

1074
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,040
he found that that they found some seed

1075
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
from him that he didn't know existed for

1076
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,400
decades

1077
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,519
uh after his sister had sadly passed

1078
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,519
away

1079
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,639
in her fridge in her freezer inner

1080
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,199
freezer

1081
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,679
and he gave some of those to todd

1082
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,279
uh matt got some of those as well

1083
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,319
um and

1084
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
um

1085
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
so those

1086
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,440
you know it's it's hard to say uh you

1087
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,240
know greg admitted

1088
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,079
that uh greg admitted that he lost

1089
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,919
everything for decades

1090
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,160
and then he finds some seeds in his

1091
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,200
sister in his deceased sister's uh

1092
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,719
fridge

1093
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,279
uh that were labeled

1094
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,759
and so at best you can say that the

1095
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,800
provenance of them is uncertain

1096
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
for sure

1097
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,560
you know it's just uncertain there's

1098
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,320
just no way to tell if it is nl5 then it

1099
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,159
would be

1100
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
steve murphy afghan

1101
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,358
by

1102
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,279
mexican colombian

1103
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,078
which which originally greg referred to

1104
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,839
as a uh hawaiian but later on he said

1105
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,240
what the hawaiian was that that was

1106
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,000
actually over there it's a hawaiian but

1107
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,959
you know i mean obviously hawaii doesn't

1108
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,159
have any natives exactly weed so most of

1109
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,720
hawaiian

1110
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,838
was sativas from other traditional

1111
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:38,719
regions brought to hawaii and grown

1112
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,880
yeah right yeah and so how did bc seed

1113
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,879
company obtain nl5

1114
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,119
so this is kind of jumping around for a

1115
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,160
minute but let's be clear

1116
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,039
uh

1117
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:51,358
most of the seed companies in amsterdam

1118
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:54,400
once they realized how

1119
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,559
profitable this seed ship was

1120
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,119
they would buy seed

1121
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,199
from whoever had the seed in holland

1122
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,039
rename it and resell it

1123
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,000
yeah okay so

1124
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,039
um

1125
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,800
you know a company bought neville's nl2

1126
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,358
f3

1127
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,160
and they renamed it oasis

1128
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,799
yeah

1129
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:17,679
uh which company is that matt remind me

1130
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,640
uh dutch passion dutch passion so dutch

1131
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,879
passion you know uh when this is jumping

1132
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,199
ahead a lot but you know within a year

1133
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,960
of shanti releasing white widow or other

1134
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,598
things there was two or three other

1135
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,199
competing seed companies in holland

1136
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,559
sowing white widow

1137
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,879
and they would just take this they would

1138
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,358
just lift the exact lineage from the

1139
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,640
people that's that first sold the seed

1140
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,039
they'd buy

1141
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,838
5 or 10 or 20 or however many packs of

1142
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,519
seed from that person grow them out

1143
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,199
pick a male and a female and start

1144
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,800
making and packaging their own seed line

1145
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,519
because it was money

1146
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,760
and then they get them out right

1147
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,440
seeds have always been shady

1148
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,599
and everybody involved in seeds has

1149
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,760
always been shady and it's already

1150
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,119
always been underground

1151
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,960
and it uh you know it's always been

1152
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,079
somewhat persecuted

1153
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,920
and so you know a lot of the characters

1154
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,280
to be perfectly honest

1155
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,200
lie

1156
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,480
and it's hard to tell what they lie

1157
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,559
about

1158
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
you know um

1159
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,039
yeah i mean the provenance of a breeder

1160
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,159
is only as good as what they can prove

1161
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,920
you know and a lot of people don't

1162
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,920
demand that proof they don't know to

1163
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,039
demand that proof or or have it even

1164
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,838
researched

1165
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,358
to demand said yeah well well i saw

1166
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,639
something we'll get to some questions

1167
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,880
here and just we'll go through like a

1168
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,838
little question and answer session

1169
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,200
um you know shortly here or whatever and

1170
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,279
we're not we won't get through it all

1171
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,960
today but i just kind of like you guys

1172
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,800
can see i mean i haven't even gotten i

1173
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,240
haven't even talked yet about the most

1174
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,680
famous hybrid of all time which is nl5

1175
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,199
hayes

1176
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,318
but there's a lot of depth to these

1177
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,439
stories on how these people got started

1178
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,358
and you know and then other people

1179
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,400
should also know that like

1180
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,719
you know

1181
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,480
some of these later seed companies

1182
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,759
uh a lot of these people worked for

1183
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,960
nipple

1184
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,480
right yeah

1185
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,599
uh adam who was part of starting thc

1186
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,318
seeds

1187
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,640
tony who was first at cerebral and then

1188
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,358
made his own sag martha seeds

1189
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:22,480
simon who was also at cerebral and then

1190
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:25,279
made serious seeds uh they all were

1191
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,760
right all of them and then within a year

1192
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,000
of leaving working for neville or

1193
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,079
leaving working for scentsy under

1194
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,159
neville to be more accurate they all had

1195
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,560
their own seed companies

1196
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:38,559
so it's highly likely

1197
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,838
that at the very least they took some

1198
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,239
stock

1199
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,799
uh some other plants some fathers some

1200
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,118
whatever from their previous job

1201
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,839
and rename stuff

1202
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,838
uh i mean that's the game right but

1203
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,279
maybe i should take a step back i'll

1204
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,799
talk for a few more minutes and then we

1205
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,480
can answer some questions and then we

1206
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,240
can do that

1207
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,400
but the other part that's cool is that

1208
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,399
one of the things that neville did that

1209
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,800
other people didn't

1210
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,079
is that he actually went to america on

1211
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,400
some

1212
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,200
speed and clone hunts

1213
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,720
and uh there's a dude who is written

1214
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,838
most people probably know exactly who

1215
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,919
this is

1216
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,440
uh he's one of the people through his

1217
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,159
books that taught me how to grow weed

1218
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,079
there's this dude named jorge cervantes

1219
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,960
and uh

1220
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,200
neville

1221
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,480
met up with jorge cervantes

1222
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,358
on one of his trips back into america

1223
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,240
and

1224
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,279
um

1225
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,199
jorge got had new breeders

1226
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,920
maybe breeders is the wrong word they

1227
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:40,639
knew growers at the very least they knew

1228
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,519
growers in the pacific northwest region

1229
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,960
and jorge hooked them up with the g13

1230
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,880
cut

1231
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,519
and what what became known as the

1232
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,000
pacific northwest hash plan

1233
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:52,000
that's right

1234
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,440
and so certain people gave neville a

1235
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,119
bunch of seed lines

1236
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,358
but then there was things like the

1237
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,119
pacific northwest hash plant

1238
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,279
the g13

1239
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,119
um you know stuff like that that ended

1240
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,440
up just being straight cuts

1241
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,280
that he purchased

1242
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,039
and um

1243
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,200
you know

1244
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,440
george wasn't somebody he used to go by

1245
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,679
a different pen name

1246
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,639
back in the day

1247
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,598
but

1248
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:26,159
yeah he he hooked up neville

1249
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,200
with those two cuts and really all we

1250
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,519
know

1251
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,439
is that neville paid 500

1252
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,280
for the g13 cut and it came out of

1253
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,519
oregon

1254
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,000
and he i don't know how much he paid for

1255
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,960
the pacific northwest hash plant

1256
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,159
not sure but he paid for that and he

1257
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,119
sent both those things back as cuts

1258
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,159
right

1259
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,039
so

1260
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,199
um you know he kind of collected over

1261
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,239
the first five or six years he was in

1262
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,519
business

1263
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:58,000
through some travels uh to afghanistan

1264
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:00,800
from meeting up with american breeders

1265
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,280
uh to going to here to go into america

1266
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,720
and buying cuts and seedlines

1267
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,240
we haven't talked about that but there

1268
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,399
was this uh

1269
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,598
very mysterious character named jim

1270
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,119
ortega

1271
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,519
that gave him

1272
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,559
seedlines that became super famous the

1273
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:20,400
garlic bud the hawaiian indica

1274
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,679
the um the maple leaf indica

1275
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,280
um

1276
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,919
and uh

1277
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,960
uh the kush four

1278
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,280
uh

1279
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,039
you know and those ended up a number of

1280
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,800
those that have been a bunch of neville

1281
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,880
projects um so neville kind of like

1282
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,599
neville kind of like was able to

1283
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,720
in that five year period you know

1284
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,160
or six year period really 84 to 90. he

1285
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,919
was constantly

1286
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,000
collecting stuff from breeders

1287
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,480
collecting stuff from people blending it

1288
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
together releasing stuff playing around

1289
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,880
with stuff and seeing what the hell it

1290
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,880
was

1291
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,480
is kind of how it got started

1292
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,358
in a sense

1293
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,599
uh you want to add any of that [ __ ] matt

1294
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,358
um actually this this is harkening back

1295
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,760
to people are asking about the bcc

1296
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,719
company and their sourcing i actually

1297
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,040
found

1298
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,598
something in reference to just that real

1299
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,440
quickly um this is the dr atomic one so

1300
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,440
it's gonna be the hemp bc seed bank i

1301
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,440
believe and they don't really give an

1302
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,880
exact um

1303
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,920
anything on how they sourced it but it

1304
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,358
does say

1305
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
uh this state of the art indica as a

1306
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,318
result over 20 years of selected

1307
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,598
inbreeding they pretty much took

1308
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:26,960
neville's

1309
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,440
description the buds have extremely

1310
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,400
frosted then they actually sold an nl5

1311
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,960
hawaiian indica nl5 haze one hawaiian

1312
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,559
haze but again it didn't see anything

1313
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,000
about the sourcing of their nl5 and they

1314
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,679
couldn't have possibly been around for

1315
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,719
it

1316
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,719
so

1317
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,519
that's a lot to digest and it kind of

1318
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,879
gives you like a super general overview

1319
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,559
of like what

1320
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,559
what neville was up to

1321
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,400
and you know some of the people he was

1322
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,679
collecting from and some of the things

1323
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,240
that he got

1324
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:59,679
um maybe we'll pause for a second and

1325
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,199
we'll hop over to the votes

1326
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,399
people are and i'll answer some

1327
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,598
questions

1328
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,280
yeah i'll read them off to you so you

1329
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,039
don't have to read them no i got them in

1330
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,119
front of me it's pretty easy

1331
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,440
uh this app that i downloaded works

1332
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,119
pretty well awesome

1333
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,119
the first question that got a bunch of

1334
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:22,000
votes is uh getting csi on here

1335
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:25,119
um csi is i could probably safely say

1336
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,559
he's a good friend of both mine and mats

1337
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,680
um we both uh chat with him uh fairly

1338
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,359
often

1339
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,679
um you know he uh we're all good friends

1340
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,358
uh it's certainly possible that we could

1341
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,558
convince him to come on one of these in

1342
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:39,920
the future

1343
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,440
um

1344
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,440
he's not quite

1345
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,679
he's not quite as talkative as matt and

1346
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,760
i am and he's a little shy

1347
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,440
but he has done it in the past and it is

1348
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,480
entirely possible that we could get him

1349
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,480
to do it

1350
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,679
uh he's a wealth of knowledge

1351
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,400
um people call him inspecta for a reason

1352
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,799
uh he's got a really curious mind he

1353
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,280
pokes and pokes and pokes and tries to

1354
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,039
figure out knowledge kind of like

1355
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,920
the rest of us everything i just said um

1356
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:12,159
that i rambled on about for forever

1357
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,240
uh that's it's the result literally of

1358
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,759
years of talking to people

1359
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,558
uh years of researching years of you

1360
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,720
know

1361
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:25,280
matt got to talk to neville

1362
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:28,318
quite a bit in 09 uh 10 12 years ago

1363
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,559
um or so got a bunch of emails and

1364
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:34,079
various kinds of communication

1365
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,040
uh there was a couple year period on uh

1366
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,680
mr nice forums which is shanti baba's

1367
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,039
site where neville was actively posting

1368
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,159
and answering a bunch of people's

1369
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,239
questions

1370
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,920
uh there's friends of his that have

1371
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,639
contributed

1372
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,318
there's enemies of his that have their

1373
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,239
own various stories

1374
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,279
and stuff and so

1375
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:58,639
um all this stuff is not easy to find

1376
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,760
it's not in any one location it's all

1377
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,358
sort of a

1378
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,960
conglomeration

1379
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,119
of uh

1380
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,880
you know just a lot of a lot of work

1381
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,200
he cares about history

1382
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,519
he cares about um

1383
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,719
knowledge uh he cares about the oral

1384
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,480
history

1385
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:18,480
i can't say when but we can try to get

1386
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,639
uh homie on here

1387
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,318
and see if he wants to chat about

1388
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,199
various things

1389
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,279
the next question is we have like i said

1390
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,598
before we have no idea who passed the

1391
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,599
pacific northwest hash plan to know yeah

1392
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,760
that's right jorge did arrange that that

1393
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,240
exchange for the pnw hash plan right um

1394
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,760
so it's not public knowledge who gave it

1395
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,399
to him we just know it came out of the

1396
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,680
oregon washington state area uh there

1397
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,358
was growers that that jorge knew that he

1398
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,358
was able to hook up with neville and

1399
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,358
neville bought them from them

1400
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,039
um so

1401
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,239
their names are not known to my

1402
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,480
knowledge

1403
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,838
uh whoever they were

1404
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,199
and

1405
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:01,279
uh the maui cut that i have

1406
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,078
so the the third that question and the

1407
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,800
next question what seeds did i buy in 94

1408
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,880
did i find anything decent and the maui

1409
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,599
cut are both related

1410
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,800
so i was dumb and i was 18.

1411
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,519
and in retrospect i went there and i

1412
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,039
bought a ton of seed

1413
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,599
but sadly

1414
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,400
i only bought one or two packs of like

1415
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,559
15 different things um

1416
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,480
and not realizing at the time that i

1417
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,880
would have been better off buying

1418
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,358
say two or three or four things like

1419
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,358
five or six or seven packs of each

1420
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,279
like 20 or 30 or 40 females of each one

1421
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,239
instead you know i bought a bunch of

1422
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,319
random [ __ ] i bought stuff from scentsy

1423
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:47,039
uh i bought some stuff

1424
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,519
from um

1425
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,519
i'm trying to think now uh the the

1426
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,679
easiest way to put it is

1427
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,800
uh i didn't find anything that was

1428
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:59,039
worthwhile on that trip except for i was

1429
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,280
at the gray area coffee shop

1430
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,279
and i was smoking a joint and we were

1431
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,800
young and this old timer was sitting

1432
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,559
down next to us

1433
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,079
and i mean old timer in the sense he

1434
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,800
probably looks something like me right

1435
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,079
now

1436
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,960
in his mid-40s a little gray whatever

1437
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,480
and uh we were smoking and we were young

1438
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,159
we were all 18. i was there with some

1439
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,119
friends of mine we were like all 18 to

1440
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:23,358
20 or whatever and we were all hippies

1441
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,680
had this mission to buy seeds and

1442
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,199
smuggle them back so we could grow

1443
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,960
i had a two lighter

1444
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,838
uh at the time so

1445
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,039
really major major player

1446
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,599
and uh

1447
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,279
i was sitting down next to him this this

1448
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,480
old guy smoking weed and we were telling

1449
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,200
him our story

1450
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,838
and he told me that he was from hawaii

1451
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:46,159
and he lived there since the mid 70s

1452
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:48,318
and every few years he came out and

1453
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,279
traded seeds with some of these guys in

1454
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,358
holland

1455
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,440
um and brought them back and tried them

1456
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,679
in hawaii on maui

1457
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,519
and it wasn't a very long conversation

1458
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,358
we drank a cappuccino i didn't ask him

1459
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,960
that many questions we smoked a couple

1460
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,078
joints together and a little hash or

1461
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,838
whatever

1462
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,000
and then at the end of it he was like

1463
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,000
well i'm super stoked you kids are out

1464
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,838
here trying to find some weed

1465
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,920
and he's like why don't you take why

1466
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,719
don't you try a little bit of what i do

1467
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,760
and he put a handful of seeds in mine

1468
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,959
um and one of those became the maui cut

1469
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,280
i stupidly didn't make any seeds

1470
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,119
uh that era i wasn't even attempting to

1471
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,800
breed yet i was just trying to find a

1472
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,318
good female to fill my two lighter so

1473
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,440
i didn't ask him any intelligent

1474
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,639
questions

1475
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,559
about it and so i call it the maui

1476
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,558
because that's the

1477
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,400
island it came from and that's the only

1478
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,839
thing i know about it

1479
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,240
so it's gorgeous though yeah so really

1480
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,000
uh the first time i went to amsterdam i

1481
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,159
went to amsterdam probably two or three

1482
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,159
times between 94

1483
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,639
and 03 probably two or three times a

1484
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,000
year i went to like three cannabis cups

1485
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,558
in that time

1486
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,679
um and i would go mostly i would go in

1487
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,440
summer

1488
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,358
but i would go i'd try to go a couple

1489
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,519
times a year and buy different seeds

1490
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,199
talk to breeders talk to various people

1491
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,960
learn as much as i could

1492
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,480
you got to realize back then there was

1493
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,480
no forums

1494
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,960
everything was just in books

1495
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,838
information was pretty hard to come by

1496
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,079
um

1497
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,480
you know information was rudimentary

1498
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,400
really uh the the way the information

1499
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,559
flows now i wish that i could have

1500
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,318
listened to somebody like this to shoot

1501
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,640
the [ __ ] about weed

1502
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,639
but it was pretty hard to come across so

1503
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,960
um

1504
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,679
the only thing i found on my 94 trip and

1505
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,000
i

1506
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,440
kept for the gift

1507
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
everything i bought

1508
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,760
was i don't want to say it was bunk

1509
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,838
uh but my 18 my 18 year old knowledge i

1510
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,800
didn't keep any of it

1511
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,358
so

1512
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,519
um i still have that cut it's still

1513
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,199
grown in mendocino county by others it's

1514
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,960
a great outdoor plant it has a bunch of

1515
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,279
might be in some popular strains that

1516
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,720
are around nowadays

1517
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,960
there's definitely in some popular

1518
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,039
strains and uh

1519
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,199
that cut is

1520
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,719
27 years old this year

1521
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:10,239
that's so wild

1522
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:13,439
so it's uh certainly my longest held cut

1523
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,239
i've had it my entire adult life

1524
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,920
it

1525
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,439
paid a lot of bills

1526
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,880
i brought it with me when i moved from

1527
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,920
chicago to mendocino county in 1998

1528
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,160
i spread it out a little bit there

1529
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,440
and it's uh

1530
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,799
it's been in a number of different

1531
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,720
things

1532
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,880
i bred with it quite a bit

1533
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:36,000
um you know i gave

1534
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,480
some hybrids that i had made

1535
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,400
of superdog which is another story that

1536
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,079
we've talked about before but superdog

1537
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,519
by maui i gave a bunch of that to

1538
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,160
mandelbrot

1539
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,920
mandelbrot uh found a fino in that that

1540
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,920
he called the truth

1541
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,480
uh and then he bred with it in some of

1542
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,280
his own lines and stuff and so

1543
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,838
um she exists in various she still

1544
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,400
exists pure with me and some friends but

1545
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,679
she also exists in some other people's

1546
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,079
work

1547
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:06,719
she might exist in some pretty famous

1548
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,880
things at this particular time

1549
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,679
but that's kind of how cannabis is you

1550
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,838
know

1551
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,759
um so there's a couple more questions i

1552
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,000
could answer for sure

1553
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,319
our friend uh flanville he said what's

1554
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,519
my personal favorite clone or line to

1555
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,719
come from neville's work

1556
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,719
you know

1557
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:28,239
the line is easy

1558
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:30,719
uh i i personally think the most famous

1559
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:32,879
uh hybrid ever made and the most

1560
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:36,719
successful cannabis hybrid that's ever

1561
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,400
been sold is normalized 5 by haze

1562
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,480
i don't think there's another there's

1563
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,519
another line that's more famous

1564
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,440
i mean

1565
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,599
if you're looking at um

1566
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,119
at the catalogs right there right out

1567
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:51,838
there on top in the 1990 catalog

1568
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,838
that picture of nl5 hayes

1569
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:56,639
do we know which one it was eight it's

1570
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:59,519
a2 it's a5 852

1571
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,960
a52 yep there it is that's the mother of

1572
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,039
neville's hate that picture right there

1573
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,358
that's the mother of neville's haze

1574
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:07,519
um that cut is still alive

1575
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,358
uh it's both in europe and it's floating

1576
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:10,480
around with a select few people in

1577
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:13,039
america

1578
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,039
it was found in 89 or something like

1579
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,719
that so it's super old

1580
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:20,079
um and

1581
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:22,480
look at all that leaf resin damn

1582
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,318
but yeah basically um

1583
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,880
you know he got you know it's kind of

1584
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,519
long but he got hayes from uh sam's dave

1585
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,680
dave watson's sam skunk man

1586
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,199
and he ended up crossing it with some of

1587
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,598
his indicas

1588
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:38,318
um maple leaf indica

1589
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,079
uh called that silver haze he crossed it

1590
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,480
with g13

1591
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,880
and you had g13 haze he crossed it with

1592
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,639
nl5 that became

1593
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,798
and the nl5

1594
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:50,879
uh i actually don't think there's

1595
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:53,440
another line as well as me thinking that

1596
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,039
it's the most famous and well-known line

1597
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,400
i don't think there's another line that

1598
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,880
has as many

1599
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,760
named elites that still exist as that

1600
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,119
line

1601
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,799
yeah it'd be hard

1602
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,680
you'd be hard-pressed to find one

1603
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:08,559
there's probably four to six at least

1604
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:10,318
famous named cuts in europe uh that are

1605
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,640
nl5 haze

1606
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,679
the piff the heights haze the cuban

1607
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:18,480
black haze the dog [ __ ] the church

1608
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:20,000
uh all those are all nl5 hispinos and

1609
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,079
they all come from

1610
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,239
88 to 95.

1611
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,680
here's another picture from scentsy

1612
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,919
so

1613
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,960
um it is

1614
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,318
uh

1615
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,079
it's probably the most

1616
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,000
it's probably the most famous line that

1617
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,039
anyone has ever made and there's

1618
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,838
literally

1619
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,440
eight to ten to twelve cuts of it that

1620
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:40,719
are all have different names that are

1621
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,798
all elites

1622
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,279
they're all still hoarded

1623
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,838
uh and exist on both in europe and in

1624
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,960
america so i think it's by far

1625
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:52,078
the most famous cannabis hybrid ever

1626
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,199
made

1627
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,839
um

1628
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:58,318
since you have this beautiful one

1629
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,239
yeah that's super skunk cincy today is

1630
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:01,358
sadly probably bunk

1631
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,118
um yeah

1632
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,039
neville worked for them that's a whole

1633
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,519
story in itself but neville worked for

1634
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,199
them after he got busted and got up they

1635
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:11,838
bailed him out of jail

1636
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,598
and they gave him a great deal of if we

1637
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:14,960
bail you out of jail you have to sell us

1638
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,000
your company

1639
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,240
oh

1640
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,400
uh he spent like he spent a good chunk

1641
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,199
of time in jail and they bailed him out

1642
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,079
and

1643
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:26,159
scentsy seeds ended up absorbing

1644
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,839
uh the seed bank from neville and

1645
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,598
retired neville

1646
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,838
as their top breeder

1647
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,160
so neville went from owning the biggest

1648
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,318
most successful seed company

1649
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,318
to having the dea after him spending

1650
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:40,880
about eight or nine months in jail

1651
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,719
and then having to go from being an

1652
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,160
owner to being the head breeder for

1653
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,639
different people

1654
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,519
and uh that's another story but they

1655
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:52,558
ended up renaming a bunch of his stuff

1656
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:55,280
um and so scentsy for the first five

1657
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,119
years in the 90s for the most part um

1658
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,640
that was where neville resided and made

1659
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:02,480
most of his beams

1660
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:05,679
and probably from 95 to 2000 they still

1661
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,920
had the vast majority of the original uh

1662
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:11,919
lines that they were working with

1663
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:14,240
uh seed laws changed in 99 and 2000

1664
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,838
in holland and most of the original

1665
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:20,399
breeders got raided and busted

1666
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:21,358
uh ben and alan drunkers are

1667
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,200
um

1668
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:25,279
dutch businessman for lack of a better

1669
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,000
term they will never admit that they

1670
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,160
lost a single plant from the originals

1671
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,400
you can't get a word out of them that

1672
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,279
anything is different than

1673
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,639
uh

1674
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,359
it's ever been

1675
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:40,078
um but most likely they lost a bunch of

1676
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:43,039
stuff and if i'm correct i think they

1677
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,880
farmed out most of their work to spain

1678
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,880
they haven't made

1679
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,200
a traditional versions of their seeds

1680
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,838
and in the the the timeline i always go

1681
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,759
by is roughly 2005 2006 is going to be

1682
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:55,679
the last times you want to buy stuff

1683
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,079
from the majority of the dutch seed

1684
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,798
banks because by then nirvana [ __ ]

1685
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,440
all of them greenhouse uh scentsy they

1686
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:06,000
were all farming out to buda seeds and

1687
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,559
eventually to lamota

1688
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,679
so basically yeah um

1689
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:13,519
sensei sadly since he had about a a 10

1690
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,480
to 15 year run

1691
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,159
of having a lot of legitimate stuff

1692
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,039
i do think that there could be some

1693
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:23,279
things in scentsy that are still real

1694
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,798
you have no idea what to know what

1695
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,640
and we do know um that they lost uh

1696
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:30,239
quite a few mother plants and breeding

1697
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:32,719
plants over the years but they'll never

1698
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,039
admit that so sadly

1699
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,879
it's no longer

1700
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,480
what they were in the 90s

1701
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,838
which was an excellent place to get a

1702
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,559
bunch of beans

1703
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:46,239
um and i will say uh seeds if you if if

1704
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,920
people want to see what original haze is

1705
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:50,000
like seedsman still

1706
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,200
has original haze that they sell i

1707
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,798
believe uh

1708
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,919
it's all it's all purchased from watson

1709
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,199
if i'm correct but if you know people

1710
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,119
talk about you know i might have a

1711
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,960
cutting of original haze and stuff it's

1712
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,920
still around it's still around in seed

1713
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,599
form

1714
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,639
you know so yeah there's i don't know

1715
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,920
there's

1716
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:09,598
we could talk endlessly um

1717
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,920
uh

1718
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,400
there's a couple things on here that are

1719
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,880
they're easy to talk about somebody said

1720
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,760
did skunkva head dog use your headband

1721
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,200
cut

1722
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,680
uh yes and no

1723
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,318
i have two headband cuts

1724
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:26,159
one of them we call the la he does not

1725
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,960
have that one but there's another

1726
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,519
headband cut that's extremely nice

1727
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:35,440
that both him and um

1728
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:38,000
icc uh both have and

1729
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,000
mr bob hemphill and some other people

1730
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,119
have it's much more of a cush-based

1731
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,199
headband

1732
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,240
and that's the headband that that he

1733
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,719
uses

1734
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,318
uh it's a great cut super potent that's

1735
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:49,598
the one that i use as well from elite

1736
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:53,279
cannabis

1737
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:56,079
yeah and then um uh you mentioned the

1738
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,240
nl5 seed line was composed of afghani

1739
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,318
colombian and mexican what makes this

1740
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:03,199
different than skunk one

1741
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:05,599
um that's a good point skunk one is

1742
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,919
afghani mexican

1743
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,559
just totally different types of parents

1744
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,480
totally different lines yeah i mean it's

1745
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,720
it's like saying somebody's italian

1746
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,159
irish and chinese you know it's not the

1747
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,639
same parents

1748
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:22,078
uh it's just the same region of origin

1749
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:25,440
um certainly sam skunk man was not using

1750
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,079
the nl cruz afghans in his lines

1751
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,358
um and it's very unlikely the mexican or

1752
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:33,920
the colombians are related um but it

1753
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:36,480
just goes to show how

1754
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,680
different blends you know from different

1755
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,039
parents can lead very different things

1756
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,639
yeah

1757
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,160
vastly different

1758
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,838
vastly different

1759
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:49,519
you know um

1760
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:51,279
let's see somebody asked about

1761
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:52,798
i don't know i mean

1762
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,000
i've been talking the whole time and

1763
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:58,000
matt has been

1764
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,079
unusually quiet while i [ __ ] so i i

1765
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,679
learn i still learn when we talk there's

1766
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,160
certain things that you said tonight

1767
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:05,679
that i couldn't [ __ ] remember um even

1768
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,118
even from being the one who talked to

1769
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,239
greg a bunch i still couldn't remember

1770
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,358
some of that stuff so i'm just learning

1771
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:12,399
um

1772
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,078
so

1773
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,599
let me let me ask this there was a guy

1774
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,359
that was talking about where can one

1775
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,640
find real old-school strains and

1776
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,318
genetics

1777
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,078
why are all these pollen chuckers with

1778
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:25,038
watered-down herm genetics and trash

1779
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,720
gear getting the most attention

1780
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,000
all right so there's a couple comments

1781
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,358
on that

1782
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,639
for one thing

1783
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:32,480
um

1784
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,679
and this is common this isn't just for

1785
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,639
weed but

1786
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,159
um

1787
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:37,920
you know some people are really good at

1788
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:38,719
marketing

1789
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,200
right

1790
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,480
uh for lack of a better term you know

1791
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,960
yeah

1792
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,440
you know there's a lot a lot of breeders

1793
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,480
um let's i'll throw it out there

1794
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,720
again right so if we get csi on here in

1795
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,400
my opinion csi is one of the absolute

1796
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,719
best breeders that's alive today and

1797
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,720
working

1798
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,480
i think he the amount of breeding he

1799
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,039
does

1800
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,119
the amount that he shows his own work

1801
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,599
the amount that he constantly cracks

1802
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,440
entire rooms of seed that he has made

1803
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,960
and shows people what's in the seed

1804
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,358
lines themselves

1805
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,159
almost nobody does that yeah

1806
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,920
almost nobody shows as much

1807
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:20,879
of his own work

1808
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,200
in pictures and you can just watch him

1809
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,160
grow after grow after grow after grow

1810
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:29,358
after grow after grow on ig for years

1811
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,480
just posting tons and tons of pics

1812
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,400
of

1813
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,760
you know most readers don't test their

1814
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,639
own work

1815
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,119
at this particular time it's very rare

1816
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,199
testing your own work is time consuming

1817
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,519
the best way to make money as a breeder

1818
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:46,719
is to make the cross give it a killer

1819
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:49,038
name make some amazing packaging pump

1820
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,038
pump pump on ig and try to get a bunch

1821
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,039
of hype going

1822
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,760
and growing it out and testing it takes

1823
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,119
time money energy space

1824
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,760
power bills

1825
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,960
you know all this different stuff and so

1826
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,559
um

1827
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,679
you know but the reason why i mentioned

1828
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,680
csi is because he is absolutely terrible

1829
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,798
at promoting himself

1830
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:14,000
he is a phenomenal breed

1831
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,440
that doesn't really self-promote the way

1832
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,199
other people

1833
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,838
you know and so you got to separate

1834
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,919
marketing from talent right

1835
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:23,759
the other thing i should say about that

1836
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,480
is that when people talk about term

1837
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,839
genetics people act like herbs are a bad

1838
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,519
thing right and so and they're not

1839
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,519
you know i said this on the live when

1840
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:35,440
matt and i were chatting before

1841
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:37,038
anybody that thinks that herms are bad

1842
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,838
is tripping

1843
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,880
yeah right herms are inconvenient

1844
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,880
in today's marketplace um obviously

1845
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,000
having seeds and stuff like that isn't

1846
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
the greatest

1847
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,760
so

1848
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,079
you know

1849
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,799
herms are just a genetic trait that

1850
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,039
enable a plant to create seed in the

1851
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,798
event that something weird happens and

1852
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,559
they don't get pollinated in order to

1853
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:02,239
continue the species

1854
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,680
right from a breeding perspective

1855
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:05,199
they're quite convenient to the

1856
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:07,759
marijuana plant

1857
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,759
um from a seedless perspective where

1858
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,119
we're trying to grow cincimalia or

1859
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,000
whatever you know however you want to

1860
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,559
call it seedless they're inconvenient

1861
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,318
um but but the marijuana plant did not

1862
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,119
develop with the idea that it was going

1863
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,239
to be seedless to it seedless is a

1864
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,000
failure

1865
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:27,598
yeah right a straight failure okay so

1866
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,719
you know it's trying to just like all

1867
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,680
other life

1868
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:32,558
it's trying to reproduce and survive

1869
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:33,759
right

1870
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,160
and

1871
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,960
you know just to be clear too

1872
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,159
there is a lot of the best cannabis out

1873
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:45,039
there that's bag seat

1874
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,679
okay straight bagsy it's really humbling

1875
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,039
as a breeder that some of the best

1876
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,480
on the planet

1877
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,200
is accidents

1878
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,280
it sure is the chem dog came from a bag

1879
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,679
of weed bought at a dead show

1880
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,000
without seeds in that bag of weed we

1881
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:02,960
don't have chem dog

1882
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,280
was a multi-term accident

1883
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,199
okay the super skunk that everybody's

1884
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,119
hunting after and everybody wants and

1885
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,199
everybody's claiming to have rks and

1886
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,798
there's rks coming out of the woodwork

1887
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,279
and everybody wants to claim like they

1888
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,480
got skunk skunk skunk

1889
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,319
that plant

1890
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,318
permed like a mofo

1891
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:22,318
it hurt like crazy

1892
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,239
but because it hurt like crazy if it

1893
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,759
didn't herm there would be no sour

1894
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,399
diesel there would be

1895
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,880
sour diesel is is from

1896
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,960
accidental harms right

1897
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,519
the reason why people have cush the

1898
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,318
reason why kush came to l.a is because

1899
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:41,119
in florida somebody's room hermed and

1900
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,400
they sold seeded weed and people found

1901
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,480
that seeded weed

1902
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,400
and they grew up some seed and they got

1903
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,119
what we known as kush

1904
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,000
sour diesel cookies

1905
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,798
okay

1906
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,159
uh chem dog you name it they're bag

1907
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,119
seeds

1908
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:59,920
and so you know a lot of people like you

1909
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,358
know jump on herms and obviously

1910
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,960
you don't want to buy a bunch of gear

1911
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,440
that has tons of herms because it's

1912
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,240
inconvenient but herms are a genetic

1913
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,240
trait like anything else and they exist

1914
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:13,199
and breeders do the best they can to

1915
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:15,838
reduce the incidence of herms

1916
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,039
but if you're breeding something okay

1917
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:18,079
nobody

1918
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,399
you know

1919
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:21,920
nobody cared that sour diesel hurmed a

1920
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,759
little bit

1921
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,158
it was fireweed

1922
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,359
yeah right tasted great got you super

1923
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,399
[ __ ] high

1924
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,759
lasted a long time burned great it's a

1925
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:34,158
herm

1926
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,479
you know kush came from a herd

1927
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,000
cookies came from a herd

1928
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,718
multiple homes

1929
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,759
so a lot of the backbone cannabis and a

1930
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:46,640
lot of the absolute most famous lines

1931
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,238
were not created intentionally at all

1932
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,560
they were accidents

1933
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,919
that happened in people's rooms and so

1934
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,239
that doesn't mean that like you want to

1935
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,039
get a bunch of hernia gear that sucks

1936
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:59,519
and makes your life crappy right um

1937
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:02,000
obviously terms are inconvenient

1938
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,520
and breeders can do the best they can

1939
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,319
to reduce

1940
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,839
her hermaphroditism traits but there's i

1941
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,679
mean matt can speak to this there's

1942
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:12,158
populations like thai

1943
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,759
and other things where herms are like

1944
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,358
prevalent

1945
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,960
yeah i mean it

1946
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,319
it really depends on which line you're

1947
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,239
running and it

1948
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,159
vastly depends on the room that the the

1949
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,000
parents were acclimated in that made the

1950
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,238
seeds if if you're if you're popping

1951
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,920
seeds from a grower that only

1952
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,439
predominantly makes seeds indoors and

1953
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,279
you want to run them all outdoors

1954
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,079
probably not the best idea you know it's

1955
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:36,159
it's acclimation climate all that goes

1956
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,920
into it the intersex traits are here

1957
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,439
people have right against them for ever

1958
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,520
since people have been breeding cannabis

1959
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:43,439
furs and camilla right but they're still

1960
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,359
here and this they're not going anywhere

1961
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,119
it's a part of the the genome

1962
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,520
and you know man there's there's a

1963
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:51,278
there's a uh there's a lot of there's a

1964
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,120
lot of questions i'll try to answer a

1965
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,920
couple more before we

1966
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:58,719
before we leave the last question is

1967
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,119
caleb using the other headband cut

1968
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,560
um caleb is csi

1969
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,519
uh and

1970
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,239
uh

1971
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,840
csi has both of my headband cuts

1972
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:09,919
uh like i said he's a real good friend

1973
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,600
of mine i trust him with my whole

1974
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,960
library he can have anything he wants

1975
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,880
from me basically

1976
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:19,119
um i love his breeding work uh you know

1977
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,920
nobody put the mendo perps which i got

1978
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:23,920
lucky enough to crack nobody put more

1979
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,600
genetics out there of the mendo perps

1980
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,600
and made it a permanent part of the gene

1981
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,039
pool more than csi

1982
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:34,159
um so he has both of my headband cuts

1983
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,479
um my la cut is a

1984
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,079
sort of a diesel type um it's much more

1985
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:41,359
of a blend

1986
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:44,079
you know uh the other one is much more

1987
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:46,479
of a cush varietal they're both super

1988
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:49,359
potent they're both in my kind of

1989
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:51,759
top five or ten cuts that i possess

1990
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:54,158
um so he has both he hasn't had him

1991
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,800
forever but he has started using them in

1992
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:58,879
various work and you can buy some of

1993
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,480
that work as we speak

1994
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,480
um

1995
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,119
mr nice i'll ignore that one just

1996
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,439
because it's a super long subject

1997
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:08,640
but the sh the short version

1998
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,039
is that

1999
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,280
after neville left scentsy he started

2000
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,679
working with shanti baba

2001
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,840
and they made they bred together for a

2002
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,158
while and the result of that breeding

2003
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,480
was super silver haze mango haze

2004
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:24,719
neville's haze some other things

2005
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:27,198
and neville was hurting for money

2006
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,480
and uh he sold

2007
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,279
shanti

2008
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:33,039
uh for a good chunk of loot uh a quarter

2009
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,840
million dollars or something

2010
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,439
um most of his seed collection from the

2011
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,239
seed bank era

2012
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,279
uh

2013
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:43,198
in the 80s uh unreleased stuff various

2014
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,279
lines and things like that

2015
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,119
so mr nice

2016
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:48,479
um like a lot of people there's some

2017
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,238
people that believe that shanti's full

2018
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,799
of [ __ ] there's some people they believe

2019
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,439
he's a shady character that he's a liar

2020
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,880
but it's indisputable

2021
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:59,519
that

2022
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,359
neville gave him a lot of real parents

2023
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,239
and neville gave him

2024
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,759
uh or sold him his seed collection

2025
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,279
um so

2026
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,960
there's not very many people that have

2027
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:11,840
indisputable evidence that they have a

2028
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,520
bunch of access to the old things

2029
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:17,279
and he's one of them

2030
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,440
that being said there's no way to verify

2031
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,679
what he has and what he doesn't have and

2032
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:22,719
so there's a lot of debate on what he

2033
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,920
has

2034
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,920
and

2035
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,440
there's disagreement and some people

2036
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,760
think he's full of it some people think

2037
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,359
he's got all the white hot fire

2038
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,280
the truth is probably somewhere in

2039
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:36,158
between i'm sure

2040
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:38,079
he has some of neville's old work i'm

2041
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,039
sure he has a bunch of neville's old

2042
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,279
seed

2043
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,158
it's hard to say exactly

2044
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,920
um

2045
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:46,238
what he currently has and what he

2046
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,199
doesn't but his provenance in being able

2047
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:51,279
to access it i don't think is in dispute

2048
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,359
would you agree with that matt oh yeah

2049
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:56,079
for sure i mean neville neville

2050
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,639
uh i mean at the very end is not talked

2051
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,719
about a lot but um he felt like shanky

2052
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,560
bobo might owe him some more money even

2053
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,079
though he wasn't in the agreement

2054
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,920
because he had done so well with

2055
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,319
neville's line so neville obviously felt

2056
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,719
that his lines were being used correctly

2057
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:12,319
and making tons of money with them

2058
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,000
there's another thing about australian

2059
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:16,399
bastard cannabis

2060
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,719
at csi i'll just say that real quick i

2061
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,759
don't know that much about it um you

2062
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,600
know csi is a true

2063
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,760
breeder um

2064
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,000
he is really interested in freaks he's

2065
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,920
really interested in genetic

2066
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,079
uh oddities

2067
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:36,079
and if nothing else abc is extremely odd

2068
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,238
uh in the way that its leaves form and

2069
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,198
stuff like that and you know a lot of

2070
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:41,519
stuff

2071
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:44,158
right now is really bottlenecked people

2072
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,440
use the same 30 40 50 cuts over and over

2073
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:49,439
and over again and so at the very least

2074
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:51,198
when you buy adc work

2075
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:54,479
you're getting something that is

2076
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:56,479
genetically unique so far

2077
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:59,439
and he's certainly widening the gene

2078
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:02,158
pool of available cannabis

2079
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:04,158
by making it by making it available to

2080
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,238
the public

2081
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,238
it is probably one of the first lines in

2082
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,079
a long time that's totally unique from

2083
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,479
what came before

2084
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,238
and it's valuable just for that

2085
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:16,079
and it's an ongoing project that he's

2086
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,919
putting a bunch of time into

2087
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:19,679
and i'm sure over the next three or four

2088
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,880
or five years we'll see a bunch more

2089
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,760
work from it

2090
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,440
uh

2091
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,119
matt can comment on this too but he's

2092
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,719
really just been getting started with

2093
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,479
his own work on it

2094
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,319
yeah yeah um

2095
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,759
i see so many people get so mad every

2096
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,158
time he posts pictures of people

2097
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,600
actually genuinely get hurt feelings

2098
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,439
when they see this plant they're like oh

2099
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,239
my god what is that piece of [ __ ] you

2100
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,839
know

2101
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,839
it's it's surprising to me because a lot

2102
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,679
of them claim to be breeders or or are

2103
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,199
seed makers and have companies but they

2104
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,640
don't see the genetic novelty in

2105
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:48,799
bringing in something completely new

2106
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,719
that hasn't really touched cannabis

2107
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,000
you know as far as modern minds

2108
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,480
there's a lot like i said there's a lot

2109
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,399
of sameness i'll say this quickly too

2110
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,799
the way the breeding has gone the last

2111
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,920
20 years as soon as something becomes

2112
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,640
famous

2113
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,158
everybody crosses it to everything else

2114
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,560
so the amount of [ __ ] right now that has

2115
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,079
cookie in it kush in it sour diesel in

2116
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,199
it skittles in it

2117
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,359
um you know you name it in it um stuff

2118
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,719
gets red and bread bread bread bread

2119
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:17,279
bread to death

2120
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:20,960
um so to take say cookies

2121
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:23,519
and to cross it with uh abc is crossing

2122
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:26,158
into a vastly different gene pool than

2123
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,080
anybody else is using and so who knows

2124
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,839
what might come of that that's the best

2125
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,840
part you don't know

2126
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,920
who knows in a few years where that

2127
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,560
might lead that might lead to unique

2128
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,239
highs that might open up the gene pool

2129
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,480
and make things pop out you're not

2130
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:42,158
expecting genetics

2131
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:44,799
and so people get on him about it

2132
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:47,119
because it's so weird um but he's really

2133
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,679
just in the infancy of playing around

2134
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:51,599
with it but you've seen that he is

2135
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,158
um you know he's been posting a bunch of

2136
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,320
pictures this last week of some of his

2137
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:57,519
work with the abc

2138
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,759
you know i don't know you guys could

2139
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,320
like this is probably odd because i've

2140
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,199
been talking 98 of the time for an hour

2141
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:04,319
and a half

2142
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:07,439
it's all good

2143
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:09,039
i can hear it in my throat um but we

2144
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:10,479
kind of want to just do this thing and

2145
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,319
maybe we'll do it like you know

2146
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:14,718
semi-often or whatever

2147
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:16,238
uh we had this thought of kind of going

2148
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,480
through the seed banks and it's such a

2149
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,799
big subject

2150
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,399
we really only touched on a little bit

2151
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,800
of the history we didn't really touch on

2152
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:27,198
haze or skunk or durbin or

2153
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:31,039
um anything from jim ortega very much

2154
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,039
but those can be for future things

2155
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,960
i hope everybody enjoyed it uh you know

2156
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:40,479
i don't want to make it a forever thing

2157
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,239
um but we could do this pretty often

2158
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:44,079
and there's also the patreon you can go

2159
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:45,759
to reader syndicate patreon where me and

2160
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,439
