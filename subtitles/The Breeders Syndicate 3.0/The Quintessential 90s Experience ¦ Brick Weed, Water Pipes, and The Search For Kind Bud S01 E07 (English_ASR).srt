what's up everyone welcome to breeders

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,719
syndicate i'm here with uh our other

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,399
host not so dog and welcome

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,359
uh today we're going to take you through

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,759
a little bit of the 90s subculture both

9
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,920
bro and me and not so both have majorly

10
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,000
different experiences in the 90s uh

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,280
we're in two different parts of

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,878
the uh state and and in his case in the

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
country um and we were at different ages

14
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,878
so i think this is going to be a good

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,719
one to to rattle off about

16
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,439
yeah i mean we're also going to

17
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,400
answer some questions and then you know

18
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:15,039
since we just dropped that uh corel

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
interview a few days ago uh if people

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,000
have questions or clarification that

21
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,679
they want about a bunch of the stuff

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,040
we'll spend some time chatting about

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,118
that as well

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,920
so you know it's kind of going to be a

25
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,599
little bit of a wide-ranging discussion

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,879
you know and we'll just kind of freeform

27
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:37,199
it from there yep sounds good okay let's

28
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:40,158
start off with uh your 90s experience

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
yeah so i mean 90s experiences uh you

30
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
know we talked about in some previous

31
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,798
episodes we did a bunch of stuff on the

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,240
80s and the history uh you know matt and

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,920
i are not that old frankly so

34
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,839
uh don't have any weed growing

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,079
experience from the 70s or the mid 80s

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
90s is where both of us start to come

37
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,118
into the picture and both of us start to

38
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,158
have actual real experiences of what was

39
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,520
there what was available uh obviously uh

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,159
matt originates from the west coast uh i

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
originate from the midwest so very

42
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,719
different uh

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,480
experiences going on that and uh you

44
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,318
know other places talk about was your

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,719
first high like and all that i don't

46
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,079
think we need to spend very much time on

47
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,239
that because it's kind of boring to be

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,319
perfectly honest yeah but

49
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,159
um i will say that you know um so i'm a

50
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,318
little older than matt

51
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,199
and when i first started smoking weed in

52
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,318
the uh in the very early 90s

53
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,719
um

54
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,000
you know there was no internet um there

55
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,519
was no forums uh like i said in previous

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
talks you know there was some books

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,680
there was high times

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,759
uh i didn't realize at the time how

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,879
inaccurate a lot of stuff was in high

60
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,639
time nobody did i read it as gospel

61
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,479
and now i could go back and read a bunch

62
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,878
of stuff and be like oh my god i hope

63
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,280
nobody takes that advice but back then i

64
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,239
mean i was totally ignorant so

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,800
for me growing up in chicago uh there

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,640
was essentially two kinds of cannabis uh

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
there was brown mexican

68
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,799
and green mexican

69
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,919
uh that was predominantly that's what

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
there was

71
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,199
there was no other kind of import that i

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,919
ever saw

73
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,039
very occasionally there was some hashish

74
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,079
a little bit

75
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,439
um but brown and green dominated it uh

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
it was seeded

77
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,280
you know

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
the green mexican tended to be a little

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,759
bit nicer

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
um it was compressed the best stuff was

81
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,798
not that compressed and didn't have that

82
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,919
many seeds we used to call that 30-60

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
weed

84
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,719
because it was 30.8 and it was 60

85
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,439
dollars a quarter yeah uh the brown

86
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,120
mexican was more twenty forty weed that

87
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,079
was more twenty and eight forty a

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,158
quarter uh and the brown mexican

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,439
could have enormously different levels

90
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,679
of compression

91
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,359
to it and what i mean by compression is

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,239
how much they squished it to get it

93
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,360
across the border yes so it was squished

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
with stems seeds buds everything else

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
you had to fluff it you had to break it

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,519
up

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,639
um

98
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
you know and that's kind of that's kind

99
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,560
of how i started uh was

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
smoking

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,478
brown and green mexican yeah that's what

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,519
we had access to

103
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,079
um there were no glass pipes unless you

104
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,639
went on dead tour and saw bob bob's

105
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,478
non-grass the type of pipes that you

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
could get were stone

107
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,039
clay

108
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,918
metal

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,759
the bongs were essentially plastic

110
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,839
and in illinois in chicago there was no

111
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,439
you couldn't even buy that in the state

112
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,959
there wasn't a single head shop in the

113
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,680
entire state uh there was a couple of uh

114
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,680
shady gas stations where you could get

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,639
some very cheap papers that they would

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,720
claim were for rolling raw tobacco yeah

117
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,319
but even those places would get hassled

118
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
by the cops

119
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,639
so for me

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
uh

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,120
you know i had to drive to kenosha

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
wisconsin i had to drive a good two two

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,399
and a half hours away

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
to get to a head shop

125
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,560
yeah uh even even access to be able to

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,720
buy any of these things and then we had

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,038
to smuggle them back in

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,160
to our spot there was no easy access to

129
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,360
anything

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
so

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,280
you know i saw damn we were paying out

132
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,000
the ass for brickweed yeah i mean

133
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,839
the uh there was no

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,439
the amount of the amount of demand

135
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,758
obviously chicago is one of the big

136
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,839
cities in america it's a metropolis it's

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
got an enormous amount of people

138
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,959
uh

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
you know i um

140
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,638
there wasn't there wasn't a bunch of

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
california weed like there is today

142
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,600
flooding the country

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,360
uh it just didn't

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,879
at least maybe maybe there was for

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,520
certain circles but my teenage ass no

146
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,478
yeah i didn't know anybody and so

147
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,799
uh the funny thing about the actual spot

148
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,439
someone said in kenosha the actual spot

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,319
in kenosha was called supreme video

150
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,279
and what it actually was was a huge porn

151
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
shop

152
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,879
uh that you had to go through and in

153
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,360
order to get to the head shop portion of

154
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,759
the porn shop you had to walk through

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
a ginormous horn

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,360
you know i mean literally you know how

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,199
they have like the glass the glass like

158
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
push beads and stuff you know yeah

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
through

160
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,399
those they had those but dildos

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
yeah so you literally had to like walk

162
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,000
through like a wall of

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,918
you never wanted to run backwards

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,439
through it naked i'll tell you oh no i

165
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,120
you know generally speaking i i didn't

166
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,560
get naked in public but

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,478
um but you know you would go there and

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,360
there would be all kinds of metal pipes

169
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,199
stone pipes a few clay pipes

170
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,560
graphics i mean that was really all

171
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,478
there was um you know uh you know

172
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,839
getting clubs and all these high-end

173
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,839
papers that you have right now they

174
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,399
had you know the jobs the ritz like they

175
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,679
had all the basic there was no raw there

176
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,279
was no

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
the the papers were pretty much

178
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,198
cigarette papers back then

179
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,679
um but yeah i mean it was literally like

180
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,000
supreme video it was uh it was a huge

181
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,079
porn shop with a headshot behind it that

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,639
you had to walk through to get to it and

183
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,038
it was two and a half hours away yeah so

184
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,680
even even access to that kind of stuff

185
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,478
was was pretty funny in that regard yeah

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,160
zigzags uh were you know that was that

187
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,758
was high end you know

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
i mean even back then this is totally

189
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
different subject or whatever but like

190
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
the high-end beer back then was like

191
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,359
heineken yeah there was probably like

192
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,959
three micro breweries or four

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
microbreweries in the whole country so

194
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,038
even what we considered high grade of

195
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,719
that was pretty messy

196
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,719
uh you know in that regard and then

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
you know i mean the level of the level

198
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
of knowledge that gets spread around

199
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
right now

200
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,239
uh is pretty amazing back then

201
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,000
it was like it was a lot of rumor it was

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,759
a lot of innuendo it was a lot of stuff

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
you learned from some older smokers

204
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,720
maybe uh you know i made matt when we

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
were planning this episode i made matt

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
laugh because he had never heard of a

207
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,839
resin chamber

208
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,159
what a resin chamber is if you got like

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,240
a metal pipe and the pipe had the

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,639
smoking part and then it bent and had

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
the long piece that you puff off of they

212
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
would have a fat chamber that unscrewed

213
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,840
and you would put your nicest mexican

214
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,840
weed in that chamber your nicest bud of

215
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,079
the eighth or quarter you bought and you

216
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,758
would smoke that because you would be

217
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:26,318
getting free thc all over your bud

218
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
and then you would smoke that bud last

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
yes eventually

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
we skipped that process and went ahead

221
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,519
and just scraped the resin

222
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,879
and just didn't didn't smoke any bugs

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,479
inside that little chamber it was always

224
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,080
there i didn't know that people put [ __ ]

225
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,599
in no it was literally called it was

226
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
literally called the resin chamber and

227
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
so i would ruin

228
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,278
the nicest butt i had that i could fit

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
in there every single bag i bought

230
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,600
because i thought

231
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,359
that uh that was the way i was that was

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
the older the older cats that's what

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,240
they told me to do and that made sense

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,959
and yeah you did you know so i ruined

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,759
wheat green rocks full og moon rocks i

236
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,679
was also telling them a story about how

237
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,919
you know uh we would get all the you

238
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,319
know the the gla the pipes that not the

239
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,838
pipes the the bongs the water pipes that

240
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,480
we would get you had to call them water

241
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,160
pipes back then or they would throw your

242
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,000
ass out of the store immediately and

243
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,559
they would have big signs that say we

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,480
only sell water pipes yeah because water

245
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,879
pipes could be used for tobacco and thus

246
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,560
weren't illegal where bongs were a

247
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,799
specific nomenclature for marijuana and

248
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,399
that could get a shop shut down so cops

249
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,679
would come in and ask if i could buy a

250
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,159
bong

251
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,838
just to see if the the shop was stupid

252
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,759
enough to say something and then they'd

253
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,160
shut it down so

254
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,838
you know yeah i mean i smoked out we

255
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,919
made pipes out of uh tin foil using pens

256
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
to form the tin foil i smoked out of

257
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:52,079
apples i smoked out of

258
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,639
uh you know cans my dad still

259
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,120
tells everyone that every uh

260
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,559
every every nasty every nasty thing you

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,159
would just laugh at now but literally

262
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,879
the very first time

263
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,319
i saw anybody smoke like using glass

264
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,720
pipes was there is this guy he's

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,440
considered the grandfather of modern

266
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,200
glass pipes his name was bob snodgrass

267
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,279
and he was a fixture on dead tour and he

268
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
would blow pipes out of the back of his

269
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,879
van

270
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,680
and sell you little top hats he had you

271
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,360
know he was the coolest thing ever uh

272
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,278
but you had to literally go to a dead

273
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
show um

274
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,759
you know and so

275
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,479
um

276
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,879
yeah we would even acquiring the method

277
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
to smoke [ __ ] weed was not very

278
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,559
simple

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
you know um thank god i didn't smoke out

280
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,599
of too much tinfoil uh my brain thanked

281
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
me but yeah screens cleaning your

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,879
screens ripping your screen out holding

283
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,919
it with a pair of needle nose and then

284
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,159
like burning the resin off the screen so

285
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,278
you could reuse it with your lighter

286
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,159
um

287
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,919
you know

288
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,799
all that type of stuff that was like

289
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,799
cutting edge technology i remember

290
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,958
yeah hemostat roach clips of course we

291
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,039
had one of those too um i remember the

292
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,000
very first time somebody told me

293
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,078
that uh you could clean up a bong with

294
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,120
alcohol and salt

295
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,679
so i had a dirty graphics plastic bomb

296
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,519
and i got like 99 alcohol and i got some

297
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,519
salt and i mixed them up and i poured it

298
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,600
in the thing and i watched the whole

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
bong just crack all the way up slowly it

300
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
just ruined my bomb because i didn't

301
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,079
realize that that's what would happen uh

302
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,159
because plastic's porous you know so

303
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,000
there was so much resin that it like

304
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,679
inhibited the glass that when it started

305
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
melting the resin it started

306
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,919
structurally [ __ ] with the pipe and i

307
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,920
ruined my bomb and i was like oh

308
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,599
you know i had to like leave the state

309
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,838
to go get another one that's all i had

310
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
you know i was like oh there goes the

311
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,240
bomb yeah so

312
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,120
you know um now head shops are easy

313
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,519
the internet exists ordering shit's easy

314
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
um all that you know we used to i used

315
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,959
to take a

316
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
uh a um

317
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,479
a tray

318
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,320
right and you take your weed up here on

319
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,399
the tray and you angle it between your

320
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,480
chest and your knees and you'd break up

321
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,720
all of your mexican at the top and then

322
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,879
all the seeds would roll down the tray

323
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,519
and collect in the bottom lip

324
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,278
um and you had to de-seed and de-stem

325
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
the entire thing just to get smokable

326
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,759
weed

327
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,399

only one that i remember is supreme

335
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
video uh it's still there

336
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,720
uh i haven't been there

337
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,120
in decades but it still exists i don't

338
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,839
know what it does now but it's certainly

339
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,440
it's certainly uh that's how hard it was

340
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,120
you know i mean even a big city like

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
chicago everything was banned everything

342
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,399
was illegal you had to go find it we

343
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
used to use um postal scales that was

344
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
the only kind of scale you could buy

345
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,240
[ __ ] getting a digital scale yeah there

346
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,839
was no digital scale available there was

347
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
nowhere that sold it there was nowhere

348
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,680
to find it so you would have the little

349
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
postal scale that you would clip and

350
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,559
you'd put your little everybody knew

351
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,680
that like a a baggie a sandwich baggie

352
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,679
was one gram and a zip lock was three

353
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,000
and a half grams you'd have to hold it

354
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,159
up you know and the buyer and the seller

355
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,639
would make sure because depending on the

356
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,319
level of compression sometimes you'd buy

357
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
brickweed and like an eighth would be

358
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
like

359
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
that and someone would be like there's

360
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,119
no way that way is right it can't wait

361
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,639
right you know and you'd have to be like

362
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
oh there's a little hanging scale but

363
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
there you go you know no it actually

364
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,919
weighs yeah um

365
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,320
you know and uh that was you know like a

366
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,278
lot of people triple beams triple beams

367
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,760
existed uh but they were hard to get the

368
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,278
older guys had triple beams you know and

369
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,600
with the you know good thing and you

370
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,360
move it along and do the whole big that

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
was the high end if you could get a

372
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,159
triple beam

373
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,680
and you had the money to grab that then

374
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,198
you're then you're really

375
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,599
then you're really doing it but postal

376
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,198
scales honestly as a teenager that's

377
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,199
what everybody was they were hideable

378
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,359
they were small exactly you couldn't

379
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,359
hide

380
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,800
you know postal scales were like the

381
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,399
standard when i was young um

382
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,919
just straight up and so

383
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,679
you know rather than talking about like

384
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,319
your first highs or whatever that was

385
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,198
the first state of weed that was weed

386
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,959
normalcy um i'll shut up for a minute

387
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,799
matt can throw in he probably has a

388
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,559
little bit better access because

389
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,479
southern california he probably got a

390
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,439
little bit nicer green bud tonight he's

391
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,959
shaking his head no uh you know

392
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,880
like my first experience like as it as

393
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,638
someone that went and actively bought

394
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,399
pot i'm not talking about watering for

395
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000
dad or any of that [ __ ] right

396
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,559
because i had no interest in any of that

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,039
when i was young age so when i first got

398
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,239
into actually actively like going trying

399
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,240
to find weed uh the first stuff i saw

400
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
was you know us

401
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,759
high school

402
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,120
[ __ ] smoking out of [ __ ] cans you

403
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,639
know

404
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
we had just gotten into high school i

405
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,480
was 13 when i entered high school and

406
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,919
that was when we first started buying

407
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,879
from you know the seniors that had

408
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,039
[ __ ] shitty ass mets but this was all

409
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,879
we knew so we grabbed it and i remember

410
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,719
the first times not breaking it up at

411
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,799
all just throwing it on a can and trying

412
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
to burn it you know no one really taught

413
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,000
us any of that kind of stuff like how to

414
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,720
properly break it up or do any of that

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,039
[ __ ] um but we saw a lot of compressed

416
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,199
brick coming through and traditionally

417
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,360
most even over all the years the ones

418
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,879
that i remember the most had this minty

419
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,278
almost chocolate smell and i'm not

420
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,039
talking like heavy terps like whoa this

421
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,159
is it just had like

422
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,480
very low smells of that or we had what

423
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,039
we called the pretendica which was the

424
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,120
uncompressed and and usually not always

425
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,559
but usually it would be more red or hued

426
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,839
it would be full

427
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:48,559
colas and it in our area we were doing

428
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,199
like 60 an ounce 250 for a p of the

429
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,679
the max but at the same time the

430
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,719
uncompressed was usually 250 to 300 or

431
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,078
60 to 70 an ounce so it wasn't a big

432
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,759
difference in the uncompressed versus

433
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,399
the compressed

434
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,360
so for me i'll just throw a little ad

435
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,440
there um since i'm from the midwest this

436
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,159
we can get a little bit historical here

437
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,519
for a second uh obviously they they made

438
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,039
uh marijuana illegal in 1910 illegal in

439
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
1937

440
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:20,159
and then they had a problem in the 1940

441
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
and that we started world war ii

442
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,480
and they needed

443
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,920
so many supplies for clothing for sales

444
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,240
for ropes for canvas uh army bags all

445
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,479
this and so they had this program called

446
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,159
hemp for victory right

447
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,399
and in hemp for victory they basically

448
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,480
paid a bunch of farmers to grow millions

449
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,799
of acres of cannabis

450
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
uh hemp act not cannabis not drug

451
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,319
cultivators but hemp for fiber in

452
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,240
illinois kansas indiana a bunch of

453
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,000
midwestern states right

454
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
so obviously if you're growing millions

455
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,720
of acres of seeded cannabis uh there's

456
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
going to be a bunch of wild seed sure so

457
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
that's where in the midwest that's where

458
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,278
the term ditchweed comes from uh it was

459
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,278
wild populations of hemp because they

460
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,558
made hemp illegal again right after we

461
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,919
won the war

462
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,838
so for 40 from 40 to 45 they just grew

463
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
just millions of acres of hemp in the

464
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,279
midwest

465
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,360
and then for decades after that

466
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,720
they paid the government the dea to

467
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,438
eradicate it yeah uh most people don't

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,919
know this but like 90 of the dea's

469
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,000
budget to eradicate cannabis was just

470
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,919
cutting down hemp fields in the midwest

471
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,798
that grew wild uh but the way the

472
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,480
government works you know um

473
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,240
you know i uh

474
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,759
the way the government works is they

475
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,960
just take the money and use the money

476
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,599
right so

477
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,400
um so ditchweed for us which we called

478
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,319
pretendica was i will freely admit that

479
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,120
multiple times i bought what i thought

480
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:50,000
were gorgeous looking ounces

481
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,119
of premium kind bud

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,759
green juicy frosty everything else and

483
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,879
paid 350 400 bucks an ounce

484
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,400
um and then you start smoking it and

485
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
at that point in my life i'd never even

486
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
heard the word cbd i didn't know it

487
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
existed i didn't even know what hemp was

488
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
really

489
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,199
and i wouldn't get high

490
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,200
and then we do this experiment where

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,120
we'd smoke some green mexican and we get

492
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,038
way higher

493
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,599
then and so we called it pretendica

494
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,119
because some entrepreneur scammers would

495
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,119
go out there and they'd harvest some

496
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,359
wild empty look gorgeous

497
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,599
they'd dry it and they'd sell it to dumb

498
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,359
bucks uh that were teenagers that didn't

499
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,678
know any better for top dollar thinking

500
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,240
they were getting the juiciest like

501
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
seven bud ounce [ __ ] looked good it

502
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
didn't look so good and so that's what

503
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,320
we called pretendica yeah uh because

504
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,840
when you got cheated out of your money

505
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,200
and you bought weed that didn't work

506
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,079
yeah no idea at the time why it didn't

507
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,960
work now i know it was cbd yeah you know

508
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,558
i was literally buying gorgeous hemp

509
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
uh but i didn't know

510
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,000
you know

511
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,280
so uh yeah i mean people are saying

512
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,119
ditch weed ditch weed that's what you

513
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,359
call it indiana illinois there's still

514
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,479
ditchweed kansas i'm sure there's still

515
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,879
ditchweed

516
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,279
uh it grows wild populations it seeds

517
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
itself they eradicate it it grows on the

518
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,000
edges of farms it grows on the edges of

519
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,839
forest it grows in ditches

520
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,599
obviously it rains a lot in the midwest

521
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,000
than summer so it doesn't need very much

522
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,798
care by humans at all to

523
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,079
propagate itself nebraska certainly has

524
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,240
a bunch

525
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,918
all those places where they farm you

526
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
know you farm millions of acres of

527
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,880
seeded weed

528
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,399
uh there's millions and millions of

529
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
seeds that hit the ground

530
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
yeah um and it establishes a wild

531
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
population essentially

532
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,559
so

533
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,759
um

534
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,359
you know uh basically you know i've

535
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,720
talked a little bit about this before

536
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,519
but like

537
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,679
uh when i in the 90s when i first got

538
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,679
into kind bud the two most reliable

539
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
places for me to find kind bud was

540
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,120
holland

541
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
and a grateful dead show

542
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,159
other than that it was incredibly hard

543
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,839
to come by

544
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
there the supply of it was terribly

545
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,319
limited the demand for it was super high

546
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,519
um

547
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,798
and

548
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,879
you know

549
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,440
so that's kind of how it was

550
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,520
like when i said 2040 for brownweed and

551
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,919
30 60 for greenweed

552
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:16,400
um anything better than mexican no

553
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,240
matter how crappy grown was 50 100.

554
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200
yeah it didn't i mean i have some

555
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,519
stories of some really messed up very

556
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,880
poorly grown kind bug

557
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,240
but didn't matter it was 50 60 70 and 8

558
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,600
and if you didn't want it somebody else

559
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,880
would hop in so figure it out yeah

560
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,359
you know i don't know if that i don't

561
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,600
know what it was like in uh and where

562
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,918
you're from matt but that that was that

563
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:43,359
was my experience getting into cannabis

564
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,960
was that was what was around yeah um

565
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,158
we didn't really start seeing really

566
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,640
good [ __ ]

567
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,720
at least in our circle until mike

568
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,640
because my dad went to prison for he was

569
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
always in and out so he wasn't really

570
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,080
like down to hook up his connects

571
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,038
because he just wasn't there and he was

572
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,000
always getting out and getting new

573
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,798
connects

574
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,640
um my best friend his name is josh moved

575
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,759
back from alaska he got sent away to

576
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
alaska

577
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,599
for some reason by his mom in high

578
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,119
school he did something bad or got in a

579
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,959
car wreck drunk or something something

580
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,879
crazy but he got shipped off to alaska

581
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,720
and he comes back and he's like check

582
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,400
this [ __ ] out he opens a saxophone case

583
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,600
he's got a bong in there and this is

584
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,519
like one of the first times i've seen a

585
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,359
glass bomb a really nice glass ball you

586
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,119
know and he breaks out this weed and it

587
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,038
smells [ __ ] crazy i've never really

588
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,199
seen weed like that and he's like yeah

589
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,359
bro he's like let me tell you about this

590
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,840
most potent strain on earth it's called

591
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,000
matluska valley [ __ ] bro you know

592
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,240
and and i didn't know about name strains

593
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,159
at that point really it wasn't like

594
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,599
it was it was all a big mystery to me

595
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,919
and he busts out some what he called

596
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,240
white rhino and some white widow you

597
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,440
know that was our first real experience

598
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,079
in our circle with those kind of strains

599
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,480
but yeah bakersfield is is traditionally

600
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,439
hardcore mecca even now you're not

601
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,038
getting

602
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
real quality [ __ ] like people that go to

603
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,000
collectives you're just not seeing

604
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
quality [ __ ] bakersfield it's not a

605
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,519
connoisseur market it's very much driven

606
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,119
by low price in bakersfield

607
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,038
so i mean that's that's the personal

608
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,279
experience or whatever we don't need to

609
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,960
like harp too too long on what our own

610
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,440
personal experiences are the main reason

611
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,880
to talk about it was just to give people

612
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,038
a sense of when you get into weed

613
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,720
you know honestly i'm not even sure i

614
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,000
would have tried to start growing as

615
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,679
soon as i did

616
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,679
if i had access to a variety of kinds of

617
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,200
kind bud that's what we called it kind

618
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,640
buddy

619
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,759
those were the kind of the two words

620
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,799
that we we used for it uh commonly

621
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,720
um was and i'll add one more piece to it

622
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,759
so when i actually did

623
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,480
um

624
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,440
meet some crews that

625
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,839
uh

626
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
had weed so this is the funny part right

627
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,319
so let's say

628
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,240
let's say that

629
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,839
you you're like three people away from a

630
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,200
grower and this grower is growing like

631
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,959
three or four or five pounds or

632
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,640
something right

633
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,159
the guy who bought all the stuff that

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,080
the guy wasn't gonna keep her personal

635
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
let's say the guy grew five pounds and

636
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,678
he sold four

637
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,119
the dude that would buy the four pounds

638
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,798
would take the four pounds and he would

639
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,038
dump him out on the table and whatever

640
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,519
he was going to keep he would pick nug

641
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,640
by nugg the nicest looking [ __ ] out of

642
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,798
the whole thing

643
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,240
because every bit of it's sold

644
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,079
so i might have only been like three

645
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
people away from the grower and every

646
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,399
butt i got in the half ounces i was

647
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,799
buying was that big yeah like there was

648
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
no like everybody could just skim every

649
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,879
person that got it they just skimmed the

650
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,200
amount they were keeping being every

651
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,559
nice bud because everything would work

652
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,319
it didn't matter

653
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,639
which is ridiculous today that like you

654
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,359
could essentially sell smalls

655
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,880
uh at a premium

656
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,558
um but

657
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440
you know the first time i heard the word

658
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:44,240
dank

659
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,278
um

660
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,839
was

661
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,880
uh going to dead shows uh that was the

662
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,879
kind of the comp kind bud or dank was

663
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,400

i was like what what does that mean he's

672
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,559
like it means it's not [ __ ] swag bro

673
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,519

674
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,839
like what the [ __ ] is schwag you know

675

yeah what is what

676
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,439
you know and so yeah i mean there was

677
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,038
this thing where i mean you know being

678
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
frank with people like when you first

679
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,400
get kind bud

680
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,319
like you didn't even know it existed you

681
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,640
know yeah and then you have a situation

682
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,399
where you already like weed

683
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,159
you're into smoking brown weed you're

684
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,840
into smoking the green weed you like

685
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
weed you like getting high it does all

686
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,359
the different things to you yeah and

687
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,120
then you get some kind bud and like you

688
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,798
didn't even realize that that grade

689
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:47,119
existed yeah there wasn't any seeds

690
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,440
you know yeah it's a trip all the first

691
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,839
kind but i saw too was indoor

692
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,278
uh coming from the midwest uh there was

693
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,798
no outdoor

694
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,640
um yeah dirt weed swag uh you know you

695
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,038
cut it sometimes with the bricks you cut

696
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,960
it with a bread knife yeah oh yeah easy

697
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,519
yeah you saw it go at it you know

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,759
serrated knife yeah you'd sit there and

699
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,599
saw it and break it up and fluff it and

700
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,079
try to figure it out and

701
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,759
all that stuff and so

702
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,720
you know i mean my friends and i like we

703
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,960
could go to

704
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,600
we could go to dead shows and

705
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
uh we could buy we could get weed

706
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,199
you know i mean that was one of the

707
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
wasn't the primary reason that we went

708
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
um

709
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,440
you know i mean it's funny i didn't have

710
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,959
anything my parents like my parents

711
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,360
weren't involved in it or anything like

712
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,038
that i guess you could say i'm first-gen

713
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,719
as far as like my family getting

714
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,480
involved but um

715
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
you know when i first went to a debt

716
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,278
show

717
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
my buddy and i were trying to figure out

718
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,558
where we could like sit down and hide

719
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,558
and smoke some weed where none of the

720
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,079
adults were gonna rat us out oh yeah

721
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,839
yeah because back then it was like you

722
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,519
know 15 or something you couldn't let an

723
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,558
adult see you smoking weed you get

724
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,599
busted yeah my grandma and mom were not

725
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,599
[ __ ] cool at all with it and it goes

726
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,278
back to the seeds i used to get popped

727
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,719
every time and i never figured out how

728
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,558
my grandma always popped me when i was

729
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,558
smoking because she would [ __ ] always

730
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,319
catch me and later on she told me it was

731
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,798
because when i would smoke bowls in my

732
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,720
room the seeds would get hot and pop out

733
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,839
and burn holes in the carpet so all

734
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
every time there was new holes in the

735
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,839
carpet she knew i was in there [ __ ]

736
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,759
smoking you know oh man we definitely we

737
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,038
definitely got taught young

738
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,400
uh to remove seeds it's certainly

739
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,919
certainly you know

740
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,759
certainly you don't always do it the

741
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,038
correct way you miss one especially with

742
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,720
you you can't get them

743
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,480
yeah and then on top of that there's

744
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,400
like this paper thin seed shell yes not

745
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,038
the hard shell but there's like a kind

746
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,880
of a papery like on a garlic you know

747
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,200
clove or something and that's what

748
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,480
stripes are on that that thin paper

749
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,400
sleeve yeah you'd miss that and then um

750
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,759
yeah and then that would taste terrible

751
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
if you got that in your bowl you'd be

752
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,679
like oh

753
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
you know and so anyway i mean yeah my

754
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,400
actually my first growing

755
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,519
was flicking seeds out my window

756
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,038
you know getting

757
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,558
some stuff so i could go on a walk and

758
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,278
smoke some weed and then i'd be like

759
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,960
mowing my out you know my lawn for

760
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,440
spring in the backyard and i'd be like

761
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,278
oh you know and i would just run right

762
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,759
over with the mower because i was like i

763
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,319
didn't even think that that would happen

764
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,519
at ridgeview at ridgio our high school

765
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,200
anybody who went there between 94 and 99

766
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,960
knew about the weed patch we had going

767
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,360
across the street and pretty much

768
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,038
everybody was in on taking care of these

769
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,479
plants as long as we could do it you

770
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,319
know until the narcs came out and

771
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
figured it out

772
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,759
yeah so i mean like for

773
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,440
you know the

774
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,398
so that's that's just kind of to set the

775
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,558
tone

776
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,319
of like that's kind of what the 90s was

777
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,398
like you know in the in the early and

778
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,240
mid 90s there was basically mexican

779
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,918
there wasn't very good access the

780
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,079
education sucked

781
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,159
you know um and

782
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,918
you know we uh that's what started my

783
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,559
trips to amsterdam

784
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,159
um was was i was like i

785
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,119
they have good weed over there and i

786
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,278
don't

787
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,278
yeah you know and then you know it was

788
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,519
like you would meet people

789
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,440
on dead tour that could give you weed

790
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,759
because lots of people would bring

791
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,278
pounds to dead tour and sell eighths and

792
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,200
quarters and ounces

793
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,519
um just to like you know do their two

794
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
three week run worth of shows you know i

795
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,558
mean that's essentially how

796
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,278
you know i mean that's what keyboard and

797
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,440
joe brand were doing when uh when chem

798
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,038
dog bought his sacks

799
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,919
they were just you know people would

800
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,879
bring good weed to dead shows and hustle

801
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,080
it you know yeah and um

802
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,760
you know maybe that maybe that uh

803
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,599
we could talk about that a little bit

804
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,558
because now it's like it's pretty widely

805
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,038
spread

806
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,200
uh throughout different parts of society

807
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,720
and there's different there's certainly

808
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,399
lots of different types of people

809
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,120
growing weed and that probably always

810
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,479
was the case but in the 90s

811
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,439
um

812
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,200
it was a hippie-based group sure like

813
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,679
the people that were most in tune with

814
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,640
weed the people that were most in tune

815
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,440
with getting weed and bringing me to you

816
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
know

817
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,519
dead shows were probably one of the

818
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,439
greatest open-air wheat markets that's

819
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,359
ever existed in america

820
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,038
because people from all walks of life

821
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,959
all parts of the country new york

822
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:13,278
florida california wherever they would

823
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,079
buy or bring their weed on dead tour and

824
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,319
that's how they would fund their party

825
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,960
their food their hotels their traveling

826
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,879
their tickets their whatever you know

827
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
most people that went to dead shows not

828
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
everyone but most people went to dead

829
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,558
show smoke weed so it was really easy to

830
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,558
sell weed and get by and it wasn't

831
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,798
nearly as sketchy as some of the other

832
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,720
substances and stuff that people hustled

833
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,798
weed was a little mellower you know so

834
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,240
yeah lots of people did it

835
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:39,359
um and

836
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,558
you know there's some there's some

837
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,479
pretty famous

838
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,480
stuff that used to get sold there uh we

839
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,599
could chat about that for a second

840
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,759
um my buddy who you know i we talked

841

about seven years older than me and so

845
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440

846
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,959
and skunk va used to go to a bunch of

847
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,278
dead shows together um with other people

848
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,278
uh and you know they

849
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,960
uh his favorite lead on dead tour was a

850
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,440
big sir holy

851
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,000
um and he said you could buy big sur

852
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
holy skunk and you could buy big sur

853
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,038
holy haze

854
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,439
and he said you know a lot of people had

855
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,759
like fanny packs back then of all things

856
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,399
but yeah he said that like

857
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,158
it was so distinctive of an aroma that

858
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,959
not only could you tell somebody had

859
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,640
dank weed in their fanny pack you could

860
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,200
tell that they were holding on to the

861
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,799
big sir holy yeah and so out of

862
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,798
everything that he had back then

863
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,679
everything he had access to

864
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,918
um that stuff whoever was doing it was

865
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,000

retrospect a lot of ignorance around my

882
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,000
area but i could go to dead shows and i

883
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,679
could learn from some old-timers or i

884

from sirius who was super nice to me

893
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,079
i met some other folks just like

894
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,240
anywhere else you know you go some

895
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,759
coffee shops you know coffee shops are

896
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,079
kind of like dispensaries they don't

897
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,000
really have the kind all that often

898
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,439
uh they have some decent stuff some of

899
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
them have some really nice stuff but

900
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,960
then when you get started getting into

901
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,360
like the collector's circles and you

902
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,679
make some acquaintances and friends

903
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:05,119
um you know that kind of stuff you start

904
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,120
meeting and getting some better read

905
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,440
you know so

906
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,760
you know yeah there was um

907
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,399
you know yeah they're like it's just

908
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,798
true it's it's dead shows were

909
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,319
dead shows were the best place for

910
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,079
because you got to realize too without

911
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,158
the internet without forums without

912
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,079
trading without any of that with

913
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
everything being illegal everywhere and

914
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,119
everything being super clandestine

915
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,720
um

916
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,278
you know little circles might get this

917
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,640
butter that bud in their local area but

918
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:33,519
not that much

919
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,120
um

920
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,798
but uh

921
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,599
you know um

922
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:42,639
you know the the modern big sur stuff

923
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,879
um i can tell you that it's not pure

924
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,640
i don't know exactly the mix but i can

925
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,840
say that some of the big stir stuff

926
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,880
that's out there

927
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:54,000
staten island has confirmed did smell

928
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,240
very similar to um we went over to

929
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,519
amsterdam in the 90s and we smelled the

930
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,919
sage

931
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,519
the actual like famous cutting of sage

932
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,240
they ran over there

933
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,480
and he confirmed that it did smell like

934
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,798
the big sur some one of the versions of

935
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,399
the big sur that he used to get um so

936
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,798
i can't say

937
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,558
um you know and there's a difference you

938
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,519
know our buddy bodhi has a cut that he

939
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,319
uses

940
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,000
uh csi has a cut uh that's a little

941
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,879
terpenoline based

942
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,640
um

943
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,640
you know there's some people in colorado

944
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,480
and other areas that has

945
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,600
um that has you know the the atom cut of

946
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,079
sage

947
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,240
um that's not really my my wheelhouse i

948
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,439
can't say which ones are more legit than

949
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,480
others

950
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,240
uh you know but um

951
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,679
you know i'm sure it exists out there in

952
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,200
various forms

953
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
you know so

954
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,480
um

955
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,440
that was uh you know that was the first

956
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,038
place i saw blueberry was on dead tour i

957
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,640
was the first place i saw northern

958
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:55,679
lights that was the first place i saw

959
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,679
skunk

960
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,759
um that was the first place i saw lots

961
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,240
of different things so

962
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,000
uh matt wasn't really into dead shows so

963
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,200
he doesn't really share that experience

964
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,119
but uh

965
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,039
um you know i do i will say i have um i

966
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,760
mean back then we were

967
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,440
we were punk rockers and in in our scene

968
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,040
it wasn't a wheat scene it was a heroin

969
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,358
scene it was a meth scene

970
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,320
and that was it killed everyone we did

971
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,960
we didn't have um a big weed scene and i

972
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,760
didn't really have the respect for the

973
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,878
dead or the dead scene for that matter

974
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,440
during those times because they were

975
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,878
just long hairs to us you know but as

976
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,800
i've gotten older and i'm more

977
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,918
passionate about about cannabis i've

978
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,159
realized how much how much really went

979
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,799
on in our scene and revolved around the

980
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,639
dead shows and as far as u.s cannabis

981
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,039
making it from point a to point b it's

982
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,200
such a major major

983
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,759
part of our history and it's it was it

984
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,678
was a serious loss not to to really open

985
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,839
my eyes to that early on yeah i mean

986
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,920
it's one of those things where it's like

987
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,519
it was kind of by default

988
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
you know that was one of the i mean some

989
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,280
of the things you know sometimes people

990
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,358
ask me um

991
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,599
you know how did you get access to all

992
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,598
these famous strains you know yeah and

993
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,320
in honesty like when i got when i got a

994
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,559
bunch of them they weren't famous at all

995
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,800
it was years before any of them become

996
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,480
famous so it wasn't like i got anything

997
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,320
that i was like oh my god this is this

998
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,079
you know it was just this is weed you

999
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,320
know um but hippies and dead and people

1000
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,320
that attended dead shows a bunch they

1001
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,119
traded amongst each other and i mean

1002
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,800
honestly when i moved out to mendocino

1003
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,519
it was because i had friends from dead

1004
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,440
tour that lived outside of yukata

1005
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,800
and i had an inn i had i had a person

1006
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,519
that knew people i had a person that

1007
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,800
could get me situated i could have me

1008
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,480
uh you know i could get situated

1009
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,160
with for lack of a better term now

1010
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,920
there's all kinds of people involved in

1011
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,279
need and it's grown much beyond it but

1012
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,599
in the 90s

1013
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,880
um i don't think there was any social

1014
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,960
group that had

1015
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,200
more access to more different kinds of

1016
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,960
stuff than

1017
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,799
than hippies

1018
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,440
because being on dead tour you'd have

1019
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,640
friends from miami and upstate new york

1020
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,838
and montana and texas and florida and

1021
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,598
alaska

1022
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,279
and everywhere

1023
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,240
i mean they would just you would gather

1024
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,599
there was spring summer and fall tour

1025
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,358
you're traveling with people you're

1026
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,200
partying with people you're smoking weed

1027
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,598
you're trading stories

1028
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,319
um so that was the way that things

1029
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,599
blended for lack of a better term it was

1030
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,599
sort of the first forums

1031
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,280
yeah it was dead shows it was where

1032
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
like-minded people could gather you know

1033
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,160
um

1034
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,719
and uh

1035
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,118
you know so uh

1036
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,719
you know i i know you know they say that

1037
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,160
there's people that have i'm looking at

1038
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,838
stuff people are saying the cut didn't

1039
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,078
come from adam i know it didn't come

1040
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,159
from adam his partner is actually who

1041
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,880
brought it to europe i believe they

1042
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,440
brought it in seed form um it was called

1043
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,720
the big sur holy uh because supposedly

1044
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
it was grown in the back of the

1045
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,078
monastery

1046
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,880
uh so it was the holy week you harry the

1047
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,400
monk full yeah so you know i mean i

1048
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,480
don't i don't have i don't really have

1049
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,358
any like specific ties to that except

1050
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,559
for

1051
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,239
um

1052
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,639
you know except for like one of my old

1053
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,399
friends uh it was kind of his

1054
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,279
he would tell these stories of it you

1055
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,240
know

1056
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,240
uh i i used a few different big sur holy

1057
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,039
lines i had one that came from indian

1058
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,959
guy

1059
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,400
or and it wasn't his creation or

1060
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,559
anything indian guy

1061
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,920
um he was he he got a lot of seeds from

1062
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,358
people and he would distribute them so

1063
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,280
we didn't really know the sourcing on a

1064
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,000
lot of this stuff from him but it came

1065
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,640
through him and it was a pink pistoled

1066
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,760
version that was supposedly the

1067
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,159
zihuatanejo purple which is in

1068
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,000
supposedly in big sur holy weed a lot of

1069
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,759
people refer to it as zacatecas purple

1070
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,559
because zacatecas is easier to pronounce

1071
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,359
than z

1072
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,078
nail

1073
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,400
but um that's where it is also the gambo

1074
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,519
version which i believe is big sir holy

1075
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,599
weed and reefer man's version bodhi had

1076
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,440
a version um the one thing that i

1077
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,519
noticed runs in common with a lot of

1078
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,679
these lines was the trapinoline and

1079
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,599
since i'm not from that area i don't

1080
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,440
know if that is uh common trait with the

1081
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,320
original big sur holy but that is what

1082
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,000
ran

1083
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,880
in between all of these

1084
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,440
yeah i'm not i can't i'd have to uh i

1085
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,240
know for sure that and i and i

1086
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,599
i honestly don't remember uh but we did

1087
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,838
you know uh

1088
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,559
mr staten island myself bought got some

1089
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:27,358
sacks from the adam and the thc crew and

1090
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,039
the midnight in that era and he did say

1091
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,759
that it smelled like that i don't have a

1092
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,199
strong memory of what it smelled like so

1093
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,880
i can't comment

1094
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,719
certainly the one that certainly has one

1095
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,000
comment he knows

1096
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:42,719
certainly the one that uh csi uses is a

1097
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,800
bit terpenoline yeah uh based i can say

1098
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,199
that for sure because i've puffed that

1099
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,599
in recent years and such and have some

1100
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,960
experience with that one but

1101
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,800
i don't think i've ever

1102
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,639
personally smoked uh any of bodies pure

1103
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,000
uh i certainly have smoked some hybrids

1104
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,118
but i don't have a memory of bodies

1105
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,119
either to be honest um you know

1106
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,160
that's what's funny too is like

1107
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,440
you know the other thing that people

1108
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,960
should know is like you know uh csi and

1109
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
bodhi are both uh

1110
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,199
reasonably good friends of ours you'd

1111
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,599
classify it as but a lot of breeders and

1112
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,838
stuff they they use their strains to

1113
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,359
breed and so some of the collection i

1114
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,199
might have known you forever and you

1115
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,759
might but that doesn't mean that you're

1116
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,679
producing smokable weed of all of your

1117
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,320
pure lines all the time where your

1118
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,919
friends can have sacs of them either a

1119
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,280
lot of the times the stuff you're trying

1120
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,358
is hybrids

1121
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,599
or s-ones or this or that or whatever

1122
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,039
else a lot of these guys aren't growing

1123
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,079
a bunch of

1124
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,719
pure

1125
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,800
you know uh females to smoke

1126
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,759
yeah they're using them in breeding work

1127
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
yeah

1128
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,119
right well it goes back to that whole

1129
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,119
statement of some plants or growers and

1130
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,960
some plants are breeders and sometimes

1131
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,320
they that's not mutually exclusive you

1132
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,838
know sometimes

1133
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,119
so maybe this would be a good time this

1134
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,719
is something that matt and i chatted

1135
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,920
about that i think is kind of it's kind

1136
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,078
of cool

1137
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,639
but we can throw this in there so when

1138
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,960
we were talking to the the

1139
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,719
on the corel interview one of the cool

1140
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,119
things was to me

1141
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:12,000
was hearing you know how they came up

1142
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,000
with the nickname victor barne

1143
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,318
and how they came up with beatrix choice

1144
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,559
victor barne was like the code name that

1145
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,358
the royal put on his bank account to get

1146
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,279
yeah

1147
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,960
to get the kickback skim that he wasn't

1148
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,680
going to be traced to him yeah and

1149
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,639
beatrix was the queen and you know that

1150
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,358
kind of

1151
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,838
yeah

1152
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,159
and that kind of that kind of ties in to

1153
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:34,880
like cannabis for a long time has always

1154
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,039
had like we've had this uh we've had

1155
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,358
this nickname game we're kind of

1156
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,838
subversive in that regard and so yeah a

1157
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,719
lot of nicknames about pop culture

1158
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,599
you know and stuff like that and we use

1159
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,000
um

1160
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,200
we give various nicknames to weed right

1161
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,519
a little crew gets it and it becomes you

1162
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,960
know you you throw a nickname on it uh

1163
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,759
for instance i'll give you a couple

1164
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,240
examples the legend of the puck

1165
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,200
uh is that the guy that everybody got it

1166
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,358
from

1167
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,318
uh you know he used to carry it around

1168
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,920
in a in a hockey puck case it look like

1169
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,318
the some people might remember bubble

1170
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,720
tape that bubble gum yes it looks about

1171
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,239
that size it literally is is a case that

1172
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,039
holds a puck

1173
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,118
you know um and uh and so they called it

1174
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,759
the puck because it came out of the case

1175
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,480
yeah um you know you know we i have the

1176
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,480
dog [ __ ] um but in minneapolis it was

1177
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,599
called electric boogaloo

1178
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,920
you know um the snow bud was called

1179
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,079
skunk five in florida

1180
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,079
um you know chem chemdawg has been

1181
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,318
called chemdog

1182
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,359
uh we called it just straight dog for

1183
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,079
years

1184
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,799
uh then it got called skunk va

1185
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,280
then it got called chem 91

1186
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,519
um and so these certain strains have

1187
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,839
names and a lot of them are funny and a

1188
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,920
lot of them tie into various things you

1189
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,719
know and stuff like that but

1190
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,318
for matt and i and others it makes it a

1191
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,719
real [ __ ]

1192
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,599
because when you're trying to find out

1193
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,719
like

1194
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,760
is this nl5 by skunk one yeah they

1195
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,519
didn't keep the real name

1196
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,040
that they got they didn't keep the

1197
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,639
lineage

1198
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,960
there's a nickname

1199
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,960
and so we put a lot of time and energy

1200
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,679
and research into finding out like what

1201
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,000
the real names are one second

1202
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,799
before you get there we do have the top

1203
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,960
voted question is in a previous episode

1204
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,800
you guys spoke about nl2 possibly being

1205
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,559
renamed to hindu kush when since he

1206
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,760
acquired devil's stuff

1207
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,639
you want to go ahead and talk about that

1208
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,400
part

1209
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,000
sure ties in so there's a there's a

1210
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,240
there's a couple things there that we

1211
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,880
could that we could talk about for one

1212
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:44,559
real quick just hindu kush is a region

1213
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,318
um and then sam skunk man dave watson uh

1214
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,199
he brought a hindu kush that was not

1215
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,920
related over to amsterdam as well at

1216
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,679
some point um and lots of things have

1217
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,159
been called hindu kush

1218
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,679
but uh in specific this the scentsy

1219
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,719
thing if you look back uh in neville's

1220
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,078
catalog

1221
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,480
basically every time he talks about nl2

1222
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,119
he and every description from the 86

1223
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,240
catalog on he calls it a hindu kush

1224
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,640
phenotype yeah right he keeps describing

1225
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,559
it as a hindu kush um there was things

1226
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:20,239
that you know he called uh what he

1227
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,559
called skunk kush was nl2 by skunk one

1228
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,639
yeah you know he kept every every ev

1229
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,519
basically every reference you can find

1230
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:30,799
to nl2 in any of the seed bank catalogs

1231
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,719
he calls hindu kush yeah and then when

1232
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,240
sensei took over they renamed a number

1233
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,959
of his things and i spoke about this

1234
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,279
before but um they

1235
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,119
they renamed it and l2 and one of the

1236
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,359
clues was they also sold skunk kush

1237
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,880
and they called it our best hindu kush

1238
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,159
phenotype crossed with skunk one yeah

1239
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,838
you know but you look in neville's

1240
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,838
catalog and skunk kush's nl2 by this

1241
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:58,480
yeah you know and so and so sensei just

1242
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:02,559
changed every reference to nl2

1243
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,559
um to hindu kush yeah right um and so

1244
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:08,719
there's they even use if you look in the

1245
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:12,559
verbiage of neville's description of

1246
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:15,279
nl2 in his 88 89 and 90 catalog

1247
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,440
they they even used similar words same

1248
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,560
words and similar verbiage and similar

1249
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
sentences

1250
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,679
um

1251
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,760
neville had some very long-winded

1252
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:27,358
descriptions of his weed

1253
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
paragraphs like that scentsy would would

1254
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,519
shrink them down to two or three

1255
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,318
sentences

1256
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,239
but

1257
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,759
it's pretty clear we've documented in a

1258
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,719
variety of ways

1259
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,040
they

1260
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,399
what what if you bought hindu kush from

1261
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,159
sensei seeds

1262
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,079
uh it was an l2 f3 that was sold by

1263
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,159
neville the last three years of the seed

1264
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,680
bank catalog

1265
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,000
and everything that they had that said

1266
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,719
nl2 nl2 just disappears off the face of

1267
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,880
the earth uh with the exception

1268
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:00,239
that dutch passion

1269
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,119
uh released an nl2 pheno that they

1270
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,879
called oasis

1271
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,800
um so

1272
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,680
one of the things that makes it tough is

1273
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,400
that

1274
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,879
there's so many nicknames given to weed

1275
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,160
that you try to trace back

1276
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,318
what it was

1277
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,799
and like we talked about before

1278
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,599
um most of the stuff that was that was

1279
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,280
coming was either from sssc or the seed

1280
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,119
bank or scentsy because that was the

1281
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,640
only games and that we were selling

1282
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,800
international seed

1283
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,838
um so a lot of their genetics are

1284
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,280
absolutely laced

1285
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,759
through uh

1286
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,760
the uh are our scene

1287
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,920
but they go by different names

1288
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,119
and then how do you piece together you

1289
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,880
know on

1290
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,039
for instance i'll give you an example so

1291
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,440
we've i've always thought that the dog

1292
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,920
[ __ ] or i i like to call it the electric

1293
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,240
boogaloo uh because i think electric

1294
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,358
boogaloo is one of the all-time coolest

1295
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,118
names in cannabis yeah um and so

1296
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,480
changing into dog [ __ ]

1297
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,240
definitely today

1298
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,480
uh in modern cannabis where everything

1299
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,879
has to be candy and evoke images and be

1300
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,400
desserty uh there's zero chance that

1301
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,079
anybody would name anything dog it would

1302
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,960
be about as much chance of dog [ __ ]

1303
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,400
being a name as like filthy sweat sock

1304
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,838
you know

1305
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,358
yeah it just wouldn't it just wouldn't

1306
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,880
come about you know

1307
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,440
um but

1308
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,960
we've always felt that it was an nl5

1309
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,519
haze phenotype

1310
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,480
uh yeah cat piss would be very unlikely

1311
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,239
um

1312
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,400
and uh

1313
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,639
you know if you not that and and matt

1314
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,079
and i have issues with philos but if you

1315
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:36,000
go and you look at philos okay

1316
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,839
some of the things that

1317
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,599
that dog [ __ ] is supposedly fairly

1318
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:43,199
closely related to

1319
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,720
um is european nl5 haze phenols that

1320
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,799
have been you know

1321
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,118
um and so we've always we've always had

1322
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,119
this idea that it was that

1323
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,358
yeah and we were able to trace it by it

1324
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,200
was called this an organ it was called

1325
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:58,159
this in minneapolis

1326
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,039
but what was it before minneapolis

1327
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,039
right

1328
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,880
and then it pops up philos isn't very

1329
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,318
good at showing family relationships it

1330
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,838
can only show them if they're really

1331
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,719
close yeah um but it shows relationships

1332
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,679
to

1333
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,159
pith

1334
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,078
yeah it shows relationships to c5 it

1335
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,000
shows relationships to a5 it shows

1336
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,800
relationships to hash plant haze and

1337
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,719
stuff

1338
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,318
and that's be probably because it's an

1339
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,879
nl5 haze

1340
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:24,558
yeah and so you try to get you try to

1341
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,559
get various stuff like that so there's

1342
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,559
all these cool nicknames you know and

1343
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,400
some of them you know i mean we know the

1344
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,119
cindy 99 story

1345
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,559
supposedly he found seeds and he's

1346
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,800
laughing but supposedly he found seeds

1347
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,559
and a butt of jack herrera yeah

1348
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,880
so that at least gives you an indication

1349
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,680
but if it was just cindy 99 and you

1350
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,640
don't know that backstory part

1351
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,000
what is cinderella 99 yeah what is the

1352

origin

1353
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,159
you know what is the and then it might

1354
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,519
have one nickname in one group you know

1355

you know no one ever called it this and

1363
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,160
it was never that you know but different

1364
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,838
groups get it and they get different

1365
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,838
nicknames and then

1366
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,358
what group you get it from or what group

1367
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:18,639
you hear about it from that's the

1368
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,358
nickname

1369
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,558
that i can i can tell everyone that in

1370
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,159
my crew

1371
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,400
uh everybody that had uh the chem dog

1372
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,480
um we called the dog

1373
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,920
yeah it was the dog

1374
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,838
you got the dog

1375
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,400
you know it wasn't chem dog we called it

1376
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:39,920
dog we shortened the dog and these new

1377
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,639
names didn't really pop up until oh six

1378
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,240
when our when our buddy uh skunk va got

1379
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:45,440
on the forums

1380
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,279
and people were trying to figure out

1381
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,960
what the [ __ ] he was talking about yeah

1382
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,960
and so they started calling it the skunk

1383
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,000
va cut

1384
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,519
you know

1385
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,800
and uh i think canada actually named it

1386
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,880
like canada the the health

1387
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,480
whatever their cannabis board is there

1388
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,480
that makes it legal they actually have a

1389
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,358
strain called skunk va because they

1390
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,199
confused it so much and confabulated it

1391
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:11,039
so much they were trying to name it

1392
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,399
after kim dog but they only named it

1393
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,318
skunky i

1394
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,358
got to know what skulk va thinks about

1395
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,239
that

1396
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,920
yeah you know and it was and and so

1397
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,719
the only reason why i bring that up is

1398
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,000
just

1399
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,799
is uh

1400
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,559
um is basically just because

1401
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,240
it just shows you the progressions of

1402
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,160
different names that different small

1403
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,118
groups of cannabis smokers can give to a

1404
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,199
strain

1405
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,039
and then if you get that strain through

1406
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,679
their crew right

1407
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,639
um you know uh

1408
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,279
you know

1409
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,960
what is it so you know another example

1410
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,040
would be you know we talked about this

1411
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,639
in the first episode that i participated

1412
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,480
in was about how

1413
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,960
my buddy from staten island went to

1414
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,039
virginia to get the skunk

1415
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,679
and he dropped it off with chemdog when

1416
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,679
he got the dog uh in massachusetts and

1417
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,558
then he drove the skunk and the chem dog

1418
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,239
west

1419
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,040
right well there's a whole bunch of

1420
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:06,318
people that call it the mss

1421
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,440
yeah the massachusetts super skunk

1422
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:08,558
right

1423
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,559
why

1424
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,079
because they heard about it or they saw

1425
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,960
it or they knew about it from

1426
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,880
massachusetts yeah it was from virginia

1427
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,280
but they didn't know that

1428
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,800
you know um some people called that the

1429
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,280
super skunk that's what we always called

1430
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,680
it in our crew there was other people

1431
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,079
that took it to colorado that was tied

1432
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,879
into the same virginia crew and they

1433
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,880
called it by the name on the tag the you

1434
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,680
know the number of the seed which was

1435
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,880
six

1436
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:39,039
yeah so some people called it skunk six

1437
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,960
some people called it massachusetts

1438
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,679
some people called it superstar

1439
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,358
uh i i think some people only briefly

1440
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,759
called it mass super skunk because what

1441
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,679
we've realized if there was another cut

1442
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,680
called mass super skunk proliferating at

1443
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,199
the same time from the same crew

1444
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,879
but we didn't even realize that for

1445
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,639
years and years yeah yeah of course yeah

1446
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,039
that wasn't that was that was pieced

1447
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,159
together fairly recently yeah the point

1448
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,679
is is that if you were from virginia you

1449
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,598
called it one thing

1450
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,039
if you were from massachusetts or new

1451
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,960
york and you got it from that crew you

1452
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,119
liked it called it another thing if you

1453
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,960
were from my crew in northern california

1454
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,680
you called it a different thing and it

1455
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,519
was all the same thing you know um and

1456
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,039
it was only recently that we started

1457
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,199
figuring you know we were able to you

1458
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,719
know through uh various friends and

1459
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,078
stuff start talking to the person who

1460
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:29,039
read it um and you know get actual

1461
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,039
information on what it was yeah uh you

1462
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,239
know and stuff like that and so

1463
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,079
the point that i was trying to make

1464
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,279
there when i was kind of long-winded is

1465
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,519
that

1466
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,359
you know we add nicknames and those

1467
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:41,039
nicknames are cool and neat and funny

1468
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,880
and all that kind of stuff but then when

1469
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,239
you go to try to figure out the lineage

1470
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,400
of stuff

1471
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,759
you hit a wall a lot of the time from

1472
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,680
90s weed

1473
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,480
yeah you don't know what it is

1474
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:55,519
because it got named dumpster

1475
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,280
or electric boogaloo or snow or

1476
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,800
you know or whatever it might be you

1477
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,280
know the trinity was named trinity

1478
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,280
because it came out of a seed of bud

1479
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,119
that a friend gave someone that came

1480
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,400
from trinity trinity county in

1481
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,280
california

1482
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,160
um so that's where uh

1483
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,839
you know

1484
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,719
yeah somebody you know

1485
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,000
we do more with sssc it's quite possible

1486
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,598
yeah guys

1487
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,119
if you if you watch your questions to be

1488
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,200
a part of like the giveaway and stuff

1489
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,280
though put it in that little question

1490
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,879
section it makes it easier for us to

1491
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,960
read and catch it like we won't miss it

1492
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,480
as much and you'll be entered in the the

1493
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,760
giveaway at the end so keep that in mind

1494
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,920
guys

1495
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,319
yeah and so so the name game happened

1496
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,159
everywhere um for different reasons in

1497
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,719
america it was mostly

1498
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:41,519
in the in the 90s it was mostly just

1499
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:44,558
crews giving cultural names to stuff

1500
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,239
um in holland and other areas it was to

1501
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,599
hide the lineage that if they got it

1502
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,199
from somebody else

1503
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,519
you know they would change the name a

1504
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,598
little bit sometimes and hide that

1505
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:56,000
that's common now in america too

1506
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,240
absolutely people people like to hide

1507
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,440
exactly where they got what they got

1508
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
well you can't you can't create

1509
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,159
something magical if someone else

1510
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,760
created it

1511
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,519
but i mean that's that's so that's the

1512
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,599
funny part right is that really what it

1513
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,039
boils down to is that

1514
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,318
you know and we we could talk about this

1515
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:14,880
kind of stuff too is like you know they

1516
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,679
everybody everybody gets to breed or

1517
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,920
whoever wants to breed um

1518
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,919
you know you get seeds and you get

1519
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,800
clones and you get whatever from your

1520
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,880
crew

1521
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,359
yeah from your connections and you start

1522
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,920
with whatever that was was there is

1523
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:32,960
nobody out there anymore that is

1524
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,280
collecting random mass land race strains

1525
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,960
on their own travels for the most part

1526
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,040
breeding them and bringing totally

1527
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,760
unique things that no one else except

1528
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,318
for the farmers in those regions had

1529
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,079
everybody gets what they get from their

1530
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,838
friends and their crew

1531
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,760
who they know and then they start

1532
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,599
reading and that's not a dis everyone

1533
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,119
wants to act like in today's world

1534
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,280
breeders have to come out with some kind

1535
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,960
of totally unique genetics and they're

1536
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,040
not just standing on the shoulders of

1537
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,039
everybody that came before them

1538
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,920
but that's a bunch of preposterous crap

1539
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:04,880
yeah

1540
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,880
it literally is you get it from

1541
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,559
you know uh you know i mean we could

1542
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,000
talk about maybe you could talk about

1543
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,599
you know there's some famous strains

1544
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,559
from down by you matt that you had

1545
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,160
access to like um bull rider

1546
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,559
well see bull rider was one of the few

1547
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,558
that i didn't have access to i didn't

1548
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,880
get access to bull riding hogs breath

1549
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,559
hogs breath i did right that kind of

1550
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,400
stuff you know that doesn't give you

1551
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,440
very good clues about what the hell's in

1552
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,880
it no old betsy hogg's breath

1553
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,240
bull rider

1554
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,240
no that's not very 91 no p91 yeah these

1555
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,399
are not helpful terms we're just barely

1556
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,919
being able to pick apart what's in p91

1557
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,160
by its growth expressions and running

1558
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,000
through enough s1s and s2s to see what

1559
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,358
its parentage is just barely getting a

1560
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,519
shot at that

1561
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,759
yeah so you know a lot of these things

1562
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,199
are just so they were cool at the time

1563
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,720
and they were pop culture they were

1564
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:54,558
culturally related or they were an

1565
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,358
inside joke in the crew or something

1566
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,640
like that you know yeah and uh

1567
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,880
you know then

1568
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,159
you know it uh

1569
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,920
you know that's just kind of the way it

1570
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:06,078
was but it makes it much more difficult

1571
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,039
now because a lot of these clone only

1572
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,000
elites

1573
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:12,558
um have these nicknames yeah and

1574
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
figuring out what they actually are

1575
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,160
is tough

1576
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,760
yeah you know because you know it would

1577
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,480
be really amazing

1578
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,799
i mean if if technology was different

1579
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,679
imagine if sssc

1580
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,358
and neville and scentsy and sirius and

1581
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,318
these different groups have been able to

1582
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,318
put up all of their original cuts into

1583
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,159
something like philos or into some

1584
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,400
something better than philos hopefully

1585
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,679
or some kind of genetic marker group

1586
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,680
where you can see the family tree now

1587
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:44,480
has exploded from all these things oh

1588
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,239
yeah because the names have obscured

1589
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,159
just how much

1590
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,879
we depended on all that

1591
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:53,279
yeah in my opinion at least yeah yeah no

1592
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,318
yeah it does

1593
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,319
you know

1594
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,400
so um

1595
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,358
you know well yeah i mean someone says i

1596
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,079
thought the p91 was a nl cubed project

1597
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:06,639
that that was one of the many many

1598
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,640
stories going around uh there's many

1599
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,118
there's so many about p91 that it's

1600
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,639
silverback tie across the

1601
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,480
something else that it's silver pearl

1602
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,239
that it's early pearl

1603
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,000
it looks it looks super skunk-faced to

1604
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,798
me and you know when we were also

1605
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,039
talking to corel it was it was really

1606
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,199
interesting to see back then that

1607
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,400
like you know he got stuff from various

1608
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:29,118
breeders

1609
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,798
um but a lot of his work came from bag

1610
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,079
seeds of wheat he liked from coffee

1611
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,000
shops yeah

1612
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,960
and you know i mean obviously we you

1613
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,318
know we we've covered it but chem dog is

1614
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,440
a bag seed

1615
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:44,639
uh sour diesel is a bag seed

1616
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,639
cookies is a bag seed trinity is a bag

1617
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,920
seed

1618
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,838
yeah you can og was bag seed uh you can

1619
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,480
go on and on and on and on and on

1620
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,639
apparently runts was too you know like

1621
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,639
it's never gonna stop yeah a bunch of a

1622
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,838
bunch of the most famous stuff is you

1623
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:04,318
find some butt seed and a bud you like

1624
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,798
and something pops out of it and

1625
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:08,159
then people are like oh you know i mean

1626
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,920
even with me

1627
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,440
and some of these like old cuts and

1628
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,200
people are like oh what about the maui

1629
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,358
what about this what about that like the

1630
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:18,159
reason why we called the maui is because

1631
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,838
that's where we it was from

1632
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,358
and i was too dumb to ask any other

1633
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,440
questions

1634
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,199
yeah i mean at the time it wasn't like

1635
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,119
that you know there wasn't this like

1636
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:29,118
enormous thirst

1637
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,119
for specific lineage

1638
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,720
like you just wanted good weed and so

1639
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,160
that's part of the problem too like when

1640
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,558
you start interviewing some of these

1641
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,920
people uh you know when when matt got to

1642
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,160
interview uh

1643
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,920
you know seattle greg or that interview

1644
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,719
that we just did you know you're like

1645
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,720
okay what exactly was was this what was

1646
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,000
beatrix choice what was that give me the

1647
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,399
give me the rundown give me the

1648
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,960
grandparents give me the how did you and

1649
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,639
they were like oh you knows i took this

1650
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,920
good weed and i had this good weed and

1651
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,440
then there was this buddy over here that

1652
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,639
i made from new york and we mixed those

1653
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,798
all together and we called it that

1654
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,239
because it was a funny thing

1655
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,960
and you're like well

1656
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,879
that's where that trail ends yeah um you

1657
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,039
know you're not gonna get the specifics

1658
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,079
of some of the stuff and not there's

1659
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:14,400
this huge desire to know that

1660
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,760
um but a lot of the lineage i mean we

1661
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,559
should be blessed that we know what we

1662
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,280
know

1663
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:22,480
and new information still bubbles up

1664
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,160
um you know and stuff like that so and

1665
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,000
you know what's funny like i've never

1666
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:27,519
remembered the disclaimer to run that at

1667
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,599
the beginning but i want to go ahead and

1668
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,519
say it here and not so said it a few

1669
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,519
times in the middle of comments and

1670
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,920
stuff but the history we're bringing you

1671
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,920
is is the best that we know it currently

1672
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,119
things change all the time people come

1673
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,960
out of the word works that are actually

1674
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,798
honest you know with some of these old

1675
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,880
lines and can and enlighten us on some

1676
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,960
of the stuff so when you guys are

1677
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,039
watching these episodes and stuff

1678
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,039
do your own research go out there kick

1679
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,798
kick dirt if we're wrong let us know you

1680
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,039
know yeah i mean we're trying to bring

1681
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,719
you the best information as we know it

1682
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,159
you're not catching me in anything if

1683
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,639
you're like you're totally wrong and i

1684
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,399
can prove it yeah great

1685
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,239
i would love to hear something that

1686
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,720
clarifies something some of this stuff

1687
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,399
is our best guess yeah usually when we

1688
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,159
present information we try to get it

1689
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,960
corroborated from different aspects of

1690
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:12,639
things

1691
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,599
uh that was one of the really important

1692
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:15,199
parts

1693
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,200
actually of the interview that we just

1694
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,439
did was there's kind of been this battle

1695
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:20,639
between sam and neville over exactly

1696
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,760
what happened

1697
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:26,639
and then getting uh corel's you know

1698
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,319
opinion on what he got from

1699
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,719
from sam as well

1700
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,119
uh and the time frame that he got it in

1701
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:35,598
you start getting little pieces that add

1702
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,280
in and it backs up one story doesn't

1703
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,400
mean it's totally right

1704
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,839
but

1705
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,519
you know that's that's what you do with

1706
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,358
evidence is you're trying to gather up

1707
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,480
evidence and give your best guess

1708
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:48,639
yeah you know sometimes people disagree

1709
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,159
what do you do when when you know three

1710
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:51,598
people are involved in the making of

1711
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:53,358
something and two of them don't agree

1712
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,039
with the other one yeah

1713
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:57,838
a lot of times people try to fix like

1714
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,400
well which person do i think lies less

1715
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,000
or lies about what or maybe their memory

1716
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,440
is just different

1717
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,639
you know i mean that could be it too i

1718
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,838
mean people like oh you said something

1719
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,759
wrong it's a lie it's not a lie

1720
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,279
sometimes it's a lie but sometimes it's

1721
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,359
just people have different memories of

1722
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,798
the same thing yeah um you know so and a

1723
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,719
lot of this stuff

1724
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:21,920
you know uh we had a big you know we had

1725
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:24,159
a big chat with uh with caleb um about

1726
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,920
breeding and goals and stuff like that

1727
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:28,639
and we chatted about how difficult it is

1728
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,720
to actually breed and you know one of

1729
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:33,118
the things that's so crazy about bag

1730
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,318
seeds or accidental pollinations

1731
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,318
is

1732
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,159
sometimes they're better than some

1733
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,798
humans best effort

1734
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:43,039
you know uh and that's really humbling

1735
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:46,318
um you know neville said that all the

1736
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:48,798
f1s he made of hayes he liked more than

1737
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,480
all the poly hybrids he made yeah he

1738
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,880
kept trying to get stuff that was as

1739
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,280
good or better and he kept failing

1740
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,039
you know and so a lot of stuff

1741
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,440
you know some of the i think some of the

1742
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,039
reason why some of these 90 cuts still

1743
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,920
rule the game like

1744
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:05,440
sour diesels and and cushes and some of

1745
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,159
these a lot of these old cuts that are

1746
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,159
still blended into things is because

1747
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,838
they were just like two raw things that

1748
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,440
weren't like each other accidentally

1749
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:14,880
combined

1750
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,480
yeah and that's one of the real things

1751
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,400
in breeding that makes a big difference

1752
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,358
is if you can cross things that are

1753
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,119
really dissimilar to each other you tend

1754
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,679
to get better results

1755
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,760
so it's a hard time to sit there and be

1756
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:29,279
like oh i'm going to take

1757
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,640
you know cushman's and i'm going to

1758
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,240
cross it by cherry pie by kush

1759
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,078
you know or something there's like it's

1760
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,919
it's pretty similar

1761
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,119
you know neville found that a lot of the

1762
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,880
pure afghans didn't like each other

1763
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,960
at all yeah you know

1764
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,640
you you know so you take you take two

1765
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,079
totally different random things from two

1766
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,318
different gene pools

1767
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,200
and that's kind of why like i am i'm a

1768
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:54,960
90s guy uh i've all i've said a bunch of

1769
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,919
times that i think the 90s is my

1770
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,599
favorite area era of weed

1771
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,680
and um

1772
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,000
you know the reason why i think that

1773
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,519
is that that was sort of the first poly

1774
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,960
hybrid era

1775
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,038
right most of the things before that

1776
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,440
were like simple crosses

1777
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:14,880
and then people started taking simple

1778
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,760
cross 2 f1s and crossing them together

1779
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,760
and a lot of times that raw work

1780
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,920
was really good

1781
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:26,480
you know so the ak-47 the the bubble gum

1782
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,240
the cali mist the western winds a bunch

1783
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,199
of stuff neville was doing the sour

1784
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,479
diesel

1785
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,239
and the other thing about it is is

1786
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,880
because weed was so good weed was so

1787
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,879
rare if it was good at all sold

1788
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,440
yeah right so the best way to keep a

1789
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,519
bunch of diverse weed alive is if it all

1790
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,599
sells super easy

1791
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,519
the worst thing one of the worst things

1792
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,079
that's happened to cannabis

1793
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,400
is these this named this name strain

1794
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:53,039
game where these different waves of

1795
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,400
purples or sours or cushes or cookies or

1796
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,000
skittles or whatever i've said it a

1797
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,838
bunch of times before but

1798
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,559
um every time that's the only thing

1799
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,159
that's easy to sell and get top dollar

1800
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,319
a whole bunch of diversity is just going

1801
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:05,838
to get put by the wayside

1802
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,759
because people

1803
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,920
people are like this is hard to sell

1804
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,160
this isn't hard to sell well in the 90s

1805
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,798
if it was good bud it was easy to sell

1806
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:17,358
yeah which meant that every kind of good

1807
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:19,759
bud imaginable survived

1808
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,880
does it all work

1809
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,319
right

1810
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,480
and i think that's really important for

1811
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:26,558
people to understand is that like you

1812
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,639
know if you want all this diversity to

1813
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:33,680
survive you have to support it

1814
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:35,679
right yeah i mean it's a it's a customer

1815
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,919
driven market and i don't i think

1816
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,519
that that's very little understood i

1817
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,240
mean i talked about that with my buddy

1818
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,119
manic quite a bit um the other day it's

1819
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,519
a very customer driven market and what

1820
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,798
the customer wants is

1821
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:53,280
you know they want uh the new the shiny

1822
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,119
uh what's hype what's you know they want

1823
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,798
variety so they can select from a pack

1824
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,880
and that really is

1825
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:01,759
the opposite of what breeding brings you

1826
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,760
know like your brain brings uniformity

1827
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,319
working lines you know

1828
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,240
there's a thousand reasons why it's a

1829
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,880
customer driven market and if things are

1830
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:13,199
ever to change there has to be that that

1831
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,559
want from the uh community

1832
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:18,719
to allow people to work lines for six

1833
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,559
you know five six years to actually work

1834
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,480
a line and not

1835
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,000
and because it's not hype it won't sell

1836
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,199
you know it's it's a hard it's a it's a

1837
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,199
catch-22

1838
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,279
yeah and i mean there's you know there's

1839
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:32,078
i mean it's kind of funny in a sense but

1840
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,079
i mean i i know we know people that one

1841
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,760
of the ways that they got a bunch of old

1842
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,839
strains that they have

1843
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,079
is they had five or six rare hype cuts

1844
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:43,519
and they would find old growers that had

1845
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,039
something that they were really excited

1846
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,199
about this guy was like oh my god i'm

1847
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,960
having a hard time selling my herb

1848
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,960
you know and they'd be like well you

1849
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,720
know i can give you this blue cookies

1850
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
and you'll get top dollar and they've

1851
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,118
been so pumped

1852
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,719
you know to get it you know and and

1853
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,280
because people

1854
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,118
i mean you know the name of the game uh

1855
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,640
you got to survive yeah you've got to

1856
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,000
find something that moves you got to

1857
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,159
find something that unless you're

1858
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,400
growing strictly on a personal basis and

1859
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,440
there's zero financial incentive in it

1860
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,440
at all

1861
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,880
um you have to give customers what they

1862
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,240
want and

1863
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,599
one of the things that you know we're

1864
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,159
not going to talk about reading very

1865
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,318
much on this episode you know but

1866
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,480
one of the aspects is like for

1867
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,719
diversity's sake is that it's hard to

1868
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,639
grow things and to take a risk

1869
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:31,038
um when the public might not like it

1870
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:32,639
very much yeah which is why right now

1871
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,400
people are like okay well how many

1872
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,838
different ways can i cross skittles

1873
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,760
cookies and kush and find something new

1874
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,798
yeah the problem is is that since that's

1875
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,079
been done

1876
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,759
like crazy for the last 10 or 12 or 14

1877
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,599
years or whatever

1878
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,079
people keep hoping that they're gonna

1879
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,798
try slightly different variations of the

1880
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:56,079
same cuts combined and pop something

1881
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:57,679
massively new and exciting yeah you know

1882
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,680
but they're really not and now

1883
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,679
everything looks like gelato

1884
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:03,279
because i mean it's just but for that

1885
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,679
thing too it's like

1886
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,039
it's not it's just there's only so many

1887
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,759
things you're going to get out of the

1888
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,440
same combinations of traits

1889
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,680
and if you keep going from bad seed to

1890
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,440
bags lead to bad seed to backseat you're

1891
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,038
selecting in a single direction usually

1892
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,079
you're selecting a single direction or a

1893
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,359
narrowing gene pool regardless and the

1894
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,039
the more it goes to that the more you're

1895
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,400
going to see things look all the same

1896
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,359
have similar chirps similar high

1897
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,160
um

1898
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,598
so

1899
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,480
oh man

1900
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,039
uh

1901
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,119
so now we have a new top question

1902
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,480
uh i don't know if we want to do this

1903
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,640
let's head into some questions there's a

1904
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,000
bunch of good questions yeah so the top

1905
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,598
one right now

1906
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,760
um is

1907
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,680
i know natsos talked briefly about his

1908
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,000
headband cuts but here's my question

1909
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,679
which headband of his cuts did csi use

1910
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,639
for his femme crosses with the d and the

1911
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:52,078
tk

1912
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,239
if i could talk a little bit about the

1913
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,318
different cuts of headband he has and

1914
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,159
how long he's had each one a little

1915
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,159
background on where each cut came from

1916
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,798
and finally which one of those cuts was

1917
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,598
used in the two crosses by csi

1918
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:05,920
uh

1919
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,280
okay so apparently those have gotten

1920
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,720
real popular

1921
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,760
which is nice

1922
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:10,798
um

1923
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,960
so

1924
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,358
uh at this point um

1925
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,599
csi is way more prolific than i am in

1926
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:20,880
terms of accessible stuff to the public

1927
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,119
so i gave him what i call my la cut

1928
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,760
uh which i've talked about before i got

1929
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:29,519
that cut in the very early 2000s

1930
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,880
um i mandelbrot was uh was trying to

1931
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,199
change what he was up to and was

1932
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,599
thinking about starting a seed company

1933
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,639
and starting breeding and so i gave him

1934
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:42,240
a whole bunch of my super dog crosses

1935
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:44,639
uh i gave him my sour diesel i gave him

1936
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,318
my super skunk and a couple other cuts

1937
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,480
um there's been some rumors i gave him

1938
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:49,440
the maui or the mendo p or the chem dog

1939
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,318
i didn't

1940
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,880
um

1941
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:56,079
and uh and he gave me

1942
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,318
uh the la cut which is the headband uh

1943
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,480
so that was the first headband cut i saw

1944
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:04,000
maybe explain a little bit of the reason

1945
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,358
why white has two names in your group

1946
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,440
because it's caused a lot of confusion

1947
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:08,719
in the head yeah it's a so it's a it's

1948
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,240
basically like

1949
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:12,159
it's a terror it's it's a terrible

1950
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:13,519
situation

1951
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,519
there's uh

1952
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:18,399
there's two names so when i got it you

1953
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,359
have to realize when i got it in one

1954
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,119
okay

1955
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,079
um or so

1956
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,880
uh

1957
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,880
the kush craze had not hit yet yeah

1958
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,880
nobody really had kush uh we have a

1959
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,199
friend that had it yeah um there was a

1960
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,279
few houses in la that were running it

1961
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,960
shout out to resin long yeah there was

1962
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,199
maybe there was there were there was

1963
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,039
there was a few crews in la that had it

1964
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,439
uh there was a few places in florida

1965
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,119
that had it uh nobody really knew about

1966
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,198
it the craze hadn't hit yet that was

1967
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,479
still four or five years away really

1968
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,919
uh when would you say you're from

1969
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,358

had it you know it was still super

1987
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,000
tightly held and so

1988
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:28,560
and i was like well what is this and

1989
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,399
he's like it's a headband fino

1990
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,560
and if you go look i have screen shots

1991
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:35,439
and stuff you know uh mandelbrot wrote

1992
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,039
some uh some uh essays and stuff for

1993
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,960
humboldt seed organization and some

1994
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:41,198
other stuff and he always talks about

1995
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,960
l.a kush and then in parentheses he puts

1996
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,000
headband

1997
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,640
okay

1998
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,640
who named headband headband is unknown

1999
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,560
unknown totally exactly what's in

2000
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,440
headband is unknown

2001
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:56,159
and i tend to believe it's a chem dog

2002
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,678
super skunk hybrid of some type

2003
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,519
i can't say that's all that's in it but

2004
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,800
it has so many similarities it's a

2005
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,600
diesel

2006
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,199
it's not exactly a diesel uh but it's a

2007
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,079
diesel family that's what it looks like

2008
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,000
to me

2009
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,640
um you know we used to sell it as sour

2010
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,279
for the longest time uh no one ever

2011
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,960
called me out and said it wasn't sour

2012
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:19,840
in fact when uh when mean gene got it

2013
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,920
uh in mine in my community uh way back

2014
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,920
when and he used it as the final stage

2015
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,399
in making his root beer which has become

2016
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,199
world famous in the last little bit all

2017
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,960
the rage uh he got it is sour

2018
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:31,919
uh and because some people would just

2019
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,319
call it that because that's what the

2020
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,359
buyers wanted um

2021
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:36,880
and so

2022
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:38,399
um you know when he lost it he kept

2023
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,719
trying to get sours and none of the

2024
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,039
sours he got were it because it wasn't

2025
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,840
it you know he didn't even realize what

2026
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,920
cut it was until a while ago i showed it

2027
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,239
to him and i cracked him a jar and he

2028
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,000
was like oh my god this is it

2029
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:52,959
this is the cut you know

2030
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,600
so

2031
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,560
um so basically what it boils down to is

2032
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,320
that

2033
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,360
there's two names for it l.a cushion

2034
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,238
headband

2035
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:03,839
la cush is vastly confusing because of

2036
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:05,839
the kush craze that hit and the fact

2037
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,360
that there's like 58 different cush cuts

2038
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,199
that came out of southern california

2039
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,439
within five or six years

2040
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,879
and the headband most people don't have

2041
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:14,879
it so they confuse it with lumpa

2042
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,199
headband they confuse it with the bay

2043
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,800
area headband they want to know well is

2044
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:19,519
it different than

2045
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,719
the

2046
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,320
um

2047
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,480
oh god what are some of the other names

2048
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,679
matt well the 56 i mean

2049
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:27,119
you know there's all these different

2050
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,760
names and they all get confusing they

2051
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,840
all have crazy lineage so

2052
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,079
then i just called the la

2053
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,079
for like it's what i put on all the tags

2054
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,439
on it for lack of a better way to put it

2055
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,439
um but

2056
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,599
you know back then it was by far the

2057
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:45,599
first headband i'd seen

2058
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,760
and uh i didn't see kush until i believe

2059
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,840
the first time i actually got a plant of

2060
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,920
og i got the flow rider

2061
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,960
in 0 4ish

2062
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,840
so it was years before i saw

2063
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,880
uh anything that became known as cush

2064
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,159
yeah right

2065
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,239
um

2066
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:04,158
so that's that's the name the next

2067
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:06,799
headband cut i saw some people call the

2068
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:09,599
56 day it takes longer than that

2069
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,760
the story is is not the greatest i don't

2070
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,440
really like to tell it but basically

2071
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,039
huh you don't need to tell him well but

2072
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,519
basically let's put it real simple there

2073
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:20,079
was some violence in the cush crew down

2074
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,640
in southern california some people

2075
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:23,519
took this cut and fled to the bay they

2076
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,880
were

2077
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,960
hiding out in the bay and they didn't

2078
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,800
want any drama to follow them

2079
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,840
so they had this cut but they didn't and

2080
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,640
they wanted to grow it but they didn't

2081
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,920
want to call it that and so

2082
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,640
they uh

2083
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:39,760
they decided to name it the headband

2084
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:42,239
to throw people off the trail yeah and

2085
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,679
then at some point a few years after

2086
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,519
that maybe it was oh five-ish or

2087
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,760
something like that they gave out a

2088
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,600
mislabeled trade they they were selling

2089
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,119
a tray of cuts to a buddy and they gave

2090
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,400
him a tray of this

2091
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:54,880
headband cut

2092
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:57,359
uh instead of uh instead of the other

2093
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,679
one and it slipped out so

2094
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:02,639

2120
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,679
most potent cuts i hold um it's a really

2121
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,840
really great cut and you're talking

2122
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:04,319
about the 56 correct the 56 i mean

2123
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:07,520
actually to be honest both cuts i would

2124
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:09,599
put both the la and the 56 in my

2125
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,760
top five potency of things i mean

2126
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,880
they're really good yeah they're really

2127
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,719
really both

2128
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,199
high quality strengths but

2129
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,198
whatever the headband the 56 was called

2130
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:21,359
before i don't know

2131
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,599
but it's not a headband it was renamed a

2132
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,479
headband to literally throw off the

2133
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,560
trail

2134
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,399
of whatever it actually is but

2135
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,000
to clarify we don't know who named

2136
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,319
headband so it could have been the first

2137
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,679
use of the name headband

2138
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:37,679
no because i got the la cut in one and

2139
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,440
he said it was a headband fino that's

2140
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,679
right um and i don't think they renamed

2141
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,279
it until the mid to that like 2004 or

2142
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,679
five or six or something

2143
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:47,920
that's interesting um because i don't it

2144
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,039
didn't slip out in the bay until

2145
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,800
around that i mean you could ask your

2146
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,119
buddy matt elite when he got it but yeah

2147
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,360
but there's a crew there's a crew um

2148
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,359
that got it in that same general time

2149
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,279
it's a super nice cut

2150
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,279
the other famous one

2151
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,198
is the lumpa

2152
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:05,039
um which is an og

2153
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,919
which isn't which is another like push

2154
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,079
type

2155
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,239
yeah he's pretty sensitive about it you

2156
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,399
know but it seems like it popped up on

2157
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,879
the forums and the first place we can

2158
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:17,119
trace back him mentioning it is about oh

2159
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,400
wait late 0809

2160
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:22,238
yep um so the la it predates that by

2161
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,679
about eight years

2162
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,759
um it predates the 56 by about four or

2163
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,800
five years as far as having the headband

2164
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,880
name

2165
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,360
um you know there's other things thrown

2166
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,520
out like day wrecker and stuff like that

2167
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:38,799
i have no idea we can't trace the day

2168
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:41,600
record lineage very far it's very hard i

2169
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,679
can't trace it um but you know to answer

2170
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,600
to final the guy's question

2171
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:49,920
um the la

2172
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:52,239
uh i gave to csi specifically because i

2173
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,480
wanted my main goal with breeding is to

2174
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:56,479
get better weed into people's hands

2175
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:59,039
uh and i knew he would throw it in

2176
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:00,718
various rooms and release hybrids of it

2177
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:04,479
and i believe the first two hybrids he's

2178
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:06,800
released of it are the tk and the d md

2179
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,839
yeah um uh

2180
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,800
d tk and la are some of my favorite

2181
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,719
things

2182
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,640
uh so i have high hopes that those

2183
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,960
things will combine well i especially

2184
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,039
have high hopes for the d which

2185
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,760
uh for a variety of reasons

2186
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:24,079
um but that's the headband cut that's

2187
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,600
the story of the three main ones

2188
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,800
um there's some guys in new york that

2189
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,000
say they have a different one there's

2190
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,640
some other people that say they have

2191
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,079
this or that headband is absolutely one

2192
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,239
of the most mysterious names in cannabis

2193
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:37,840
lineage is a pain in the ass who named

2194
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:39,919
it is a pain in the ass

2195
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,000
um i'm not saying that i have the first

2196
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,679
one but i have the first one that i

2197
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,439
encountered yeah that does seem

2198
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:49,039
encountered it does seem like those

2199
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:51,759
other two popped up years after

2200
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,519
um for lack of a lack of a better term

2201
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,360
yeah uh

2202
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,480
you know so

2203
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,238
i don't know there's another question

2204
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,799
that got a bunch of votes whose durbin

2205
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:02,479
poison is the official version mel or

2206
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,279
sam well

2207
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:04,319
uh

2208
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:06,960
so

2209
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:09,279
i can answer that also when carell

2210
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,399
stated the durbin was imported wouldn't

2211
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,238
that make dp comparable to mexican brick

2212
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,079
uh yeah so

2213
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:18,479
basically you know we chatted about this

2214
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:22,880
at the end of the last interview

2215
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:25,919
but mel frank in either 1978 or 79 he

2216
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,480
gave uh sam skunk man both the afghani

2217
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,440
one and the durbin poison that he had

2218
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,319
and sam traded him some sativas

2219
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,759
uh

2220
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:38,639
sam then later on in in 84 85 when he

2221
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:42,480
went to amsterdam he brought mel frank's

2222
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,440
uh version of durban poison to amsterdam

2223
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:47,279
um mel frank had some terrible accidents

2224
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:50,079
and he lost i believe all of his

2225
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,840
original seed collection sometime in 83

2226
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:53,039
or 84 as well

2227
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,079
so

2228
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:58,000
um we thought for a long time that mel

2229
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,039
frank's version was the only durbin

2230
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,119
poison

2231
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:05,119
uh in holland and therefore everybody's

2232
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:07,599
urban poison must be a derivative of

2233
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:09,519
what sam brought from mel

2234
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,520
uh but then in the corel interview we

2235
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,640
find out that that was totally wrong

2236
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,800
and

2237
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,679
there was an actual coffee shop named

2238
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,440
durbin poison that sold south african

2239
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,920
wheat and they got all their durbin

2240
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:24,639
poison from bag seed that they bought

2241
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,679
from the coffee shop yeah so that really

2242
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,719
widens the durvin poison gene pool

2243
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,600
um

2244
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,520
you know

2245
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,400
and where people got things so if people

2246
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:37,040
got durbin poison from sssc

2247
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:38,719
it was probably it was from bag seed

2248
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:42,560
if they got it from

2249
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:44,239
um neville it was probably mel's version

2250
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,520
and it's hard to say

2251
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:49,759
other other seed banks carried uh durbin

2252
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,520
poison other than those two and we don't

2253
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,960
really know right at this particular

2254
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,400
moment what their sourcing was so

2255
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,920
um i don't know if there's an official

2256
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,719
durbin poison

2257
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,279
um and the version that mel is selling

2258
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,640
now or that now mel is selling but maybe

2259
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:06,559
it's todd or somebody like that is

2260
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,560
selling um it's all claimed to be

2261
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,719
original or whatever but i mean mel said

2262
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,360
that he lost his collection in the 80s

2263
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:15,439
early 80s so it would have to be stuff

2264
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,759
that they got back from amsterdam from

2265
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:19,119
someone at some point yeah maybe it was

2266
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,679
from sam skunk man maybe it's

2267
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:23,840
reproduction sam who knows and sold back

2268
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,000
to todd or somebody else or

2269
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,719
uh that kind of thing

2270
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,960
uh who made bluedream

2271
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:33,279
don't know so

2272
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,198
the the running theory is bluegrass

2273
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:36,960
seeds blue hen

2274
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:39,359
which was the very

2275
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,840
first super silver haze

2276
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,119
blueberry cross and the sd cut that we

2277
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,199
were all growing back in the day the

2278
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:46,079
very first iteration of blue dream

2279
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,359
uh

2280
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:51,600
was very much a super silver haze dj

2281
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,679
blueberry so that's that's

2282
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,239
the most conclusive i've seen plus the

2283
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:58,480
old photo in the can of bible is a

2284
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,399
picture of the blue dream sc cut under

2285
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:02,559
blue hen and jason king got a lot of

2286
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,879
stuff right about that part

2287
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,000
yeah so i mean i've heard rumors you

2288
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:10,480
know um it's it's kind of hard to say

2289
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,520
yeah um it's nothing conclusive it's a

2290
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:13,599
great cut

2291
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,679
i mean it got it people laugh about it

2292
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,280
but when it's right you know when it's

2293
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,800
grown right and it's not you know people

2294
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,359
laugh at it because there was so many

2295
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:23,760
people it got so big so many people grew

2296
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:26,079
seven to ten pound blue dreams and

2297
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,039
flooded the market with huge blue dream

2298
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:28,639
stuff

2299
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,399
you know if you grow it and it only

2300
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,960
gives you four or five six ounces it's

2301
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:35,599
pretty dank and and there was also the

2302
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,639
mass influx of when blue dream got

2303
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,639
popular uh spanish seed banks

2304
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:43,760
kicking out a bunch of blueberry haze

2305
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:45,760
crosses labeled blue dream and

2306
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,800
us

2307
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:51,360
u.s companies sold blue dream seats in

2308
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,679
mass which really really ruined the

2309
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,679
market for that actual cut now that cut

2310
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,960
is almost impossible to find i see lots

2311
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,960
of stuff that looks like it but doesn't

2312
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,719
smell like anymore so there was another

2313
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:04,719
were you guys able to find out any more

2314
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:08,158
info about the haze a and c females

2315
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:10,319
uh not really except for

2316
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:12,879
there is a group of

2317
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:15,039
haze collectors in holland that have

2318
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,079
various ones have various old hybrids

2319
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:17,119
and cuts

2320
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,119
and

2321
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,719
they call them different things

2322
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,000
uh they have some different names to

2323
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:24,079
them uh in the first part of the

2324
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,479
interview with matt when he said he had

2325
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:28,960
ac my job i hit the floor because i

2326
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:31,439
thought he had the mail yeah we used all

2327
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,198
famously and that was confirmation that

2328
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,479
that that he had it he was going to use

2329
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:36,799
it and all this different stuff and that

2330
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:38,879
was pretty amazing now it turns out that

2331
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,440
they're two different females

2332
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,679
um that needs some more research i don't

2333
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:46,799
think matt and i right now can speak

2334
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:48,480
definitively to exactly what those are

2335
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,920
yeah but the hope

2336
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,039
would be that there's some kind of

2337
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,440
hybrid that we didn't realize existed

2338
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,880
uh that would be that would be the best

2339
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,678
um

2340
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,840
um someone was asking about sacred seeds

2341
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,199
i did and i i mentioned this earlier

2342
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,760
when someone asked if we were going to

2343
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,439
have sam on i reached out i made an

2344
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,000
offer for him to come on the podcast

2345
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,079
just to talk about history no bias um he

2346
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,679
wasn't very receptive but hopefully in

2347
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:15,600
the future he changes his mind because

2348
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,880
he's a very important character in all

2349
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,760
this

2350
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,880
yeah so um what exactly makes a real

2351
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,000
skunk

2352
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,719
um

2353
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,560
so i would say two things one obviously

2354
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:29,039
if if anything that comes out that

2355
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,760
smells extremely skunky

2356
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,719
you could call skunk and two

2357
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,000
would be

2358
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:39,119
um that's the name that that rob and

2359
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,639
sam gave to this hybrid hybrid of

2360
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:45,519
colombian mexican and afghani

2361
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:47,359
um and so all the finos that come out of

2362
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,199
that would be real skunk

2363
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:50,880
the ones that smell like skunk the ones

2364
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:53,519
that smell like grape the one that smell

2365
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,359
like citrus i always i oh i never call

2366
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,080
it skunk i only call it skunk one just

2367
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:58,479
to

2368
01:22:56,079 --> 01:23:00,479
to never divide the two or they never

2369
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,119
disinfect the two you know but it just

2370
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:04,479
goes to show that you know you can

2371
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:06,079
you know you can have something in a

2372
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,079
strain that's quite predominant for a

2373
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,319
while and you can breed away from it and

2374
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:11,920
you can get other expressions to pop up

2375
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:15,039
and then those expressions that were

2376
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:18,319
once at once very common not

2377
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:18,319
now you can't find them again

2378
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:24,079
is anyone working with an elite super

2379
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:25,599
silver haze old sog that's my favorite

2380
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,760
personally but yeah there's good super

2381
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,440
silver aces out there his is one that's

2382
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,159
been passed around a long time on like

2383
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:34,158
tanaka mana and other places and it's my

2384
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,719
personal favorite it had this willy

2385
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:39,279
wonka factor where when you inhale it

2386
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,119
it's cherry and you excel it's cheese it

2387
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:42,880
is really unique that way very skunk

2388
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:44,719
bunny in that sense it's faster

2389
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,560
flowering than most phases

2390
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,639
much more manageable than most hazes i

2391
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,840
like it what about you

2392
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,159
um

2393
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:55,600
you know i

2394
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:57,759
i like haze i like sativas in general i

2395
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,600
like i'm a peculiar kind of person i

2396
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,520
like i like different expressions of

2397
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,679
stuff you know i mean it's kind of like

2398
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,679
favorite food even if you have your top

2399
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,960
three or four favorite foods you

2400
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,319
certainly don't want to eat them every

2401
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,359
day um i have i i have weeds that i

2402
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:15,119
would like to smoke regularly um and

2403
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:17,359
then i have stuff that i would like to

2404
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,439
like you know palette cleansing if you

2405
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,279
will that i like to have around

2406
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,479
uh i'll say things like even most

2407
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:24,479
strains like

2408
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:26,479
like for instance you know the la is one

2409
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,158
of my favorite cuts if you smoke it

2410
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,000
every day you get ripped

2411
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:32,000
if you go a few months without smoking

2412
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
it and then you smoke a fast fresh batch

2413
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,679
it does something different to you

2414
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,439
so there's something about terpenes and

2415
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,119
cannabinoid content and building up

2416
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:42,319
tolerances and stuff

2417
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:43,679
um that you know i think variety is the

2418
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:44,399
spice of life

2419
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,039
you know

2420
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:49,679
um and i like unique highs

2421
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:51,920
i like sativa highs i like indica highs

2422
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,000
i like the blends it just has to be

2423
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,039
potent and do something to me that i

2424
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,399
enjoy

2425
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:58,800
you know yeah

2426
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:00,879
there's some more questions top three

2427
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,239
strains the dead tour disseminated it's

2428
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,159
impossible

2429
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,559
uh yeah like it was it was literally an

2430
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:08,638
open-air weed market people would bring

2431
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,560
all kinds of strains from all kinds of

2432
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,279
walks of life to be sold in small

2433
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,679
amounts to other hippies at campgrounds

2434
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:18,238
and on the lot and stuff like that so

2435
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:19,679
i mean my top three might just be the

2436
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,359
people that i knew

2437
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,039
uh you could probably ask a bunch of old

2438
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,039
dead heads and stuff and they might have

2439
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:26,800
all kinds of different stories of what

2440
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:28,479
their top three was

2441
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,320
um

2442
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:31,279
you know uh

2443
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:34,238
so

2444
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:36,479
you know i what which headband is the

2445
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:38,479
dog head from skunk va

2446
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,559
i believe i'd have to ask him we'd have

2447
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:42,879
to check to be sure i believe his is the

2448
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,480
56th day i'm pretty sure but we have to

2449
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,960
ask yeah i'd have to i'd have to ask to

2450
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:49,279
be so it's definitely not the l.a

2451
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,880
he does not have that one i believe

2452
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:54,238
um him like i said i see collective and

2453
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,319
and him a long time ago they've known

2454
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:57,759
each other a long time i believe in that

2455
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,079
little circle in our little circle

2456
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,639
that's the one that got passed around

2457
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:07,279
um

2458
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:10,000
so jj jj said lumpa's headband is fake

2459
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:12,719
um you know i know i don't know what to

2460
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,600
say about that one except for

2461
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,239
um

2462
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:19,679
you know we think that uh the lumpus

2463
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:21,519
headband is a very potent uh cush pino

2464
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,679
i think that's the fairest

2465
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,120
and and i will i can quote lumpa i mean

2466
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,520
we were very good friends for a long

2467
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:29,279
time he said that's just a [ __ ] og

2468
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:32,159
like he even said it himself that's just

2469
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:34,639
a [ __ ] og that's it so you know i

2470
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,719
mean he's i mean i i'm not i you know

2471
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,600
the lump of headband is a good cut yeah

2472
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,480
it's it's

2473
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,239
[ __ ] it's enjoyable smoke yeah um it

2474
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:44,238
certainly came out later than the other

2475
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,279
headband cuts he's pretty protective of

2476
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:47,279
the name

2477
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:49,279
you know um because he put his name on

2478
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:51,599
it or whatever but it's a super nice cut

2479
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:56,719
you know um but it is one of the later

2480
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,719
headbands to pop up on the scene yeah um

2481
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,360
speaking of neville and nl5 thoughts on

2482
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:04,000
the basic five that is the co-parent

2483
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:05,000
with skunk one and the m-39 skunk one by

2484
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,719
basic five from

2485
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,800
[Music]

2486
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:11,119
you know that one's kind of tough um you

2487
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,960
know we we asked one little question

2488
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:16,880
about it i didn't i you know i didn't

2489
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:19,198
get the clearest answer uh i do think

2490
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,639
that they're probably the same i can't

2491
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,158
say for sure

2492
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,239
um

2493
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,238
you know it's it's not clear

2494
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,238
yeah unless unless he actually says like

2495
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,319
yeah for sure this was it you may not

2496
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,238
remember you know yeah it's not it's at

2497
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:33,759
this particular time it's not clear i

2498
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:36,479
mean that's really all i can say about

2499
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,920
it it does seem it does seem like you're

2500
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:39,599
right in the sense that you can look at

2501
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,920
those two things and be like oh those

2502
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:45,199
seem like they're similar or whatever

2503
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:47,520
um but there's not uh there's not

2504
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:50,079
there's not any verification you know or

2505
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,239
of anything like that you know so

2506
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:54,079
uh i don't know what to say

2507
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,158
about that

2508
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,319
anymore so that was uh

2509
01:27:56,158 --> 01:27:59,599
um

2510
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:01,519
you know

2511
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,679
that was uh

2512
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,960
i don't know that was all the questions

2513
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,158
but yeah do some housekeeping for a

2514
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,510
minute and then we'll chat about some

2515
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:14,079
different stuff

2516
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:15,679
[Music]

a lot of these old dudes out there and i

2520
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,719
mean we're not really bringing people on

2521
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:24,879
that are like blood tenders and and and

2522
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,800
stuff like that that are more common era

2523
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,319
we're trying to keep this to the history

2524
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,520
of strains you know what i mean like

2525
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:31,039
that's what we love that's what we nerd

2526
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,199
out on but if you know someone that

2527
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,319
you'd be really into give them a shout

2528
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:36,000

2531
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,279
some different ideas and stuff like that

2532
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,760
it's going to be a pretty wide-ranging

2533
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,639
podcast we started with the the 80s just

2534
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,400
because that's kind of like the

2535
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:47,760
beginning of what most people are

2536
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:49,920
familiar with

2537
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,920
we want to do some other work we have

2538
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,920
some pretty cool stuff planned some of

2539
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,079
it takes a certain amount of research

2540
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,920
and making sure that the proper people

2541
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,039
have time we're going to try to be

2542
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,399
bringing on

2543
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,319
you know one of the things that's going

2544
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:04,079
on with other podcasts is that they tend

2545
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:07,359
to be interviews of current people

2546
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:09,760
selling seeds uh which is great to get a

2547
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:12,238
view into the mind of that person and an

2548
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,239
idea of what their desires and what

2549
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,759
their ideas are

2550
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:17,198
it seemed like it was underserved and

2551
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,159
there could be a lot of interest in the

2552
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:22,319
history of what's going on right now uh

2553
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,319
and how we got here and so

2554
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:25,599
there's going to be a con a bunch of

2555
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:27,279
history there's going to be some

2556
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,520
interviews there's going to be some

2557
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,359
different aspects of things

2558
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,600

different things like that

2568
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,439
um you know it's all about their

2569
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:55,679
availability and them fitting into the

2570
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,279
show i mean you you know we actually

2571

him on to

2573

talk about something that's close to his

2574
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,638
heart which is breeding goals um so we

2575
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,399
might have some people on

2576
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:08,239
that we're not even really interviewing

2577
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:12,000
them per se we're just adding their

2578
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:13,678
voice to the larger group uh discussion

2579
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,800
you know so

2580
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:18,239
uh yeah we have you know archive you

2581
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,320
know there's various people that have

2582
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:21,839
reached out um we're going to fit them

2583
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:24,158
all in i mean we want to keep we want to

2584
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,400
keep uh doing all that stuff

2585
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,920
uh staten island i don't know i'll have

2586
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,319
to ask him i just talked to him last

2587
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,480
week we'll see uh we'll see what people

2588
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:34,399
say some of them are shy

2589
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:36,559
some of them are busy some of them we

2590
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:37,920
might want to just wait and fit in you

2591
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,920
know breeder steve would be a good

2592
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,800
person to bring on when we want to talk

2593
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,158
about the switzerland era sure of things

2594
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,920
because he was one of the big people in

2595
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:48,238
the swiss era along with shanti and some

2596
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:50,158
others or blueberry or any number yeah

2597
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:51,839
or any number of different things so

2598
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,319
we're not just trying to bring people on

2599
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,319
to talk about their history per se if we

2600
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,399
can talk about their history and combine

2601
01:30:56,319 --> 01:31:03,319
it with some other era that's pertinent

2602
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,319
to them uh that makes sense too

2603
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:11,119
so

2604
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:12,719
uh be sure to keep your eyes out for the

2605
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:14,960
notification emails we're still doing

2606
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,600
crowdcast right now however we are

2607
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,960
planning on switching over to twitch um

2608
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,280
so if you have a twitch account make

2609
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,560
sure if you don't have one go make one

2610
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:24,000
very soon we're gonna be switching over

2611
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,239
to twitch and it's gonna be a little bit

2612
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,399
different format um on twitch i can

2613
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,079
actually put like pictures up on the

2614
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:33,119
screen as opposed to trying to hold them

2615
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:35,439

2651
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:54,719
bunch of cool stuff going on on the

2652
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:57,120
breeders syndicate discord we chat on

2653
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,198
there all the time um one of the things

2654
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,198
that matt and i are doing is we kind of

2655
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:03,198
wing it on this show a little bit but

2656
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:05,119
the reason why we can wing it is because

2657
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:07,039
this is our hobby

2658
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:08,880
you know weed history learning all this

2659
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,198
different aspect trying to like find

2660
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,359
truths amongst this this is my life

2661
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:15,839
partner so this is uh this is what we

2662
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,359
chat about all the time so really this

2663
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,800
is just like matt and i have been doing

2664
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:20,799
this with a big group of friends for

2665
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,239
years yeah and all of a sudden we just

2666
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,840
turned on the camera and decided to

2667
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:25,678
bring other people in

2668
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,840
is kind of is really kind of the focus

2669
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,000
of it and so some of this stuff is

2670
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,880
pretty well worn paths for us

2671
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,039
so

2672
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,039
uh it's really not you know the the

2673
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:36,639
financial aspect of it is

2674
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,719
i mean it's relevant in the sense that

2675
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:41,039
you need finances to exist yeah you

2676
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,719
might not know but the speakeasy crew

2677
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,119
behind this they do a ton of time of

2678
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,480
editing and a bunch of work and a bunch

2679
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,000
of leveling and a bunch of all this

2680
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:49,919
stuff to bring this to you they're kind

2681
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,399
enough to host this thing

2682
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,639
so you know um purchasing seeds from

2683
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:56,479
them purchasing some merch from them

2684
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:58,480
uh contributing get your breeders to get

2685
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:59,439
merch we got merc you know

2686
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,119
joining

2687
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:03,279
joining the joining the breeder

2688
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:05,760
syndicate uh it costs about the cost of

2689
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:08,399
a latte a month yeah so it's not an

2690
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:10,159
enormous situation out there you know so

2691
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:11,599
and in the very near future there is

2692
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:13,519
going to be major discounts for seed

2693
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:16,000
purchases on speakeasy if you're a part

2694
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:18,080
of their patreon and our patreon which

2695
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
would cost you 10 bucks a month but it's

2696
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,359
it's insane like the amount of savings

2697
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,840
that they're talking about doing is

2698
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,119
pretty crazy um yeah so we get along

2699

bringing it to people they put a bunch

2703
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,039
of time and energy

history over time to the forefront um

2719
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,440

01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,119
it sounds confident and we know what

2721
