00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,500
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,239
we're the traditional Market

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,679
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,280
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,738
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,920
welcome to reader Syndicate I'm Matt

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,680
here with thousand fold and today we're

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,359
going to have our buddy iron Lonesome

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,700
back for a more expansive more solo type

30
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,319
gig and I'm really stoked to have him

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,880
here I know thousand is as well we

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,319
wanted to do this for a while and I know

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,618
it's probably one of our most requested

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,478
episodes to go back and recover so thank

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,759
you for being with us

36
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,280
yeah thanks for having me

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,438
all right dude yeah

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,420
yeah so I think today we're just

39
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,519
following like a loose like linear

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,859
chronological

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,719
um structure so I think you know we

42
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,640
start at the start

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,618
um hi and Lonesome how did you what were

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,379
your first few interactions with the

45
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:47,459
plant you know how did you get into that

46
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,259
uh so I got into it pretty young uh as a

47
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,239
teenager

48
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
we would get you know Mexican brick

49
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,618
weeds that was all that was available

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
um I didn't have

51
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,719
family doing it anything like that

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,540
um so we did it it was always pretty

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,679
poor quality but it was loaded with

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,239
seeds

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,760
uh I come from a farming family so

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,099
you know I naturally planted seeds

57
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,780
pretty much initially you know probably

58
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,000
within

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,439
the first year of smoking I started

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,219
trying to grow it

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,318
um

62
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,080
it was

63
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,878
it was hit or miss but I think I had my

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,180
first harvest when I was

65
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,459
about 17 years old I grew up to Mexican

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,099
bag seed

67
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,199
um got a quarter pound of weed and I was

68
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:40,579
dig digging all over High School I was

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,579
the coolest dude I knew

70
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,179
what was that

71
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:49,199
well you know

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,140
Mexican back then it was it was weird

73
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,780
you would get weed that was

74
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:57,119
dried like [ __ ] wasn't cured either

75
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,360
cured in a tire crossing the border or

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,780
you know it was just yeah God God awful

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,239
quality in the finished product but

78
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,818
you'd plant the seeds and

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,180
um you know you would get you'd get

80
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,759
interesting stuff the problem with a lot

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,420
of the Mexican backseat is that it would

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,079
have intersex issues outside even

83
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,179
um

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,580
I I don't know I think it was just part

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,379
of the genetics so that

86
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,300
um you know the first time I grew it was

87
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,459
lightly seated and then the next year it

88
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,260
was lightly seated and

89
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,900
um I'd occasionally come across some

90
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,639
plants that didn't have any intersex

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,239
issues and

92
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,919
um you know back then

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,959
seeds you know you couldn't find seeds

94
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,539
without ordering them from Amsterdam

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,199
which seemed very sketchy at the time

96
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,719
yeah um so you know pretty early on I

97
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:56,179
was trying to select four plants that I

98
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,180
could grow and have Cincinnati

99
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,000
in terms of like the resources that you

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,280
had and in terms of information like how

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,560
much did you know about the plant at

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,479
that point like did you uh know

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,219
immediately to look look out for males

104
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,798
like that kind of thing

105
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,560
uh yeah you know I had a little bit of

106
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,500
you know kind of Stoner Knowledge from

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,379
people that had tried to grow

108
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,500
um I did have people in my family that

109
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,899
grew but I was a little young for

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,720
anybody to really share information with

111
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:34,439
me or take me under their wing you know

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,880
so I kind of had had a Baseline and

113
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:42,000
luckily I was trying outdoor

114
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,418
um so you know I didn't have to worry

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,819
about time uh you know time light cycles

116
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,978
and all of that I just kind of let it do

117
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,099
its thing and uh tried to finish it

118
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:55,199
outside how cool are your parents with

119
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,020
you doing all this

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,978
um uh not cool but

121
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,319
um you know when when I was a teenager

122
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,300
they kind of had a messy split up so it

123
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,959
was kind of like I could get away with a

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,319
lot of [ __ ] perfect timing yeah yeah and

125
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:17,519
it was kind of at that age for me so I I

126
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:20,219
started with Gorilla growing and

127
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,219
um didn't really do anything outdoor

128
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,639
until I moved out or didn't do anything

129
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,340
indoor until I moved out right when I

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,019
was able to 18 years old and you know I

131
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,899
wanted to get an apartment so that I

132
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,579
could blow it up and grow indoor that's

133
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,459
the reason you wanted to move out not

134
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,859
like to yeah that was your buddies no

135
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,439
that was my number one motivation that's

136
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,819
awesome

137
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,959
I knew what you wanted to do for a

138
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,719
career

139
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,519
yeah yeah pretty early on what I wanted

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,139
to do

141
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,659
would you tell us a little bit about

142
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,160
what some of those gorilla Growers would

143
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,240
like

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,220
yeah so uh early on it was

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,699
pretty much just

146
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,160
you know I I'd get some dry amendments

147
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,160
back then you know stuff that was

148
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,800
readily available chicken [ __ ]

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,960
um of course I would line that I'd get

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,280
blood meal bone meal cut meal all that

151
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,138
stuff anything I could get at the feed

152
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,079
store without having to go to the city

153
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,400
to the Hydra store and being sketchy

154
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,180
yeah I would get that I would dig

155
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,659
um

156
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,160
I would take a couple 15 gallon planters

157
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,259
that we had I would dig holes

158
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,439
normally I'd try to do at least you know

159
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,139
30 gallon holes and I would get all the

160
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,538
soil out have a tarp mix it up with dry

161
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,280
amendments put it back

162
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,918
um didn't add anything for aeration

163
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,859
didn't really know anything about that

164
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,599
um but I knew that you know I needed

165
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,259
very fertile soil to make anything

166
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,479
happen so I would you know I would use

167
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,340
the native soil and just add dry

168
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,199
amendments until I thought it was good

169
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,379
enough

170
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,800
okay so very little inputs

171
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:13,740
um I tried I always tried

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,418
because I I wasn't going to run any sort

173
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,639
of irrigation or anything like that all

174
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:21,060
of my girl grows over the years I've

175
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,939
tried to do in areas where I had easy

176
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,819
access to water so

177
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,699
um you know narrow river near a pond

178
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,039
near a lake something like that

179
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,900
um that because I always I always toted

180
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,478
it so it was

181
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:41,038
whatever would be the least work

182
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:43,258
while be somewhat discreet

183
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,019
I had never really thought much about

184
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,759
like the Gorilla growing aspect and and

185
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,379
not wanting to go to hydro stores and a

186
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,240
lot of Outlaw States

187
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,159
um but it would make sense why you would

188
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,478
have grown up like learning the organic

189
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,460
amendments and all that stuff versus

190
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,459
having to go risk your ass or your face

191
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:02,839
at a hydro store you know take multiple

192
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:05,339
cars on your way back yeah yeah I mean

193
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,560
well yeah it was just it was what was

194
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,478
available at the time I could either you

195
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,660
know I could get Miracle Grow or I could

196
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:15,000
get dry amendments and do it like I was

197
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,520
you know trying to grow a bad estimated

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,259
plant around me a lot of people grow

199
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,538
tomatoes you know my family did that

200
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,000
growing up and it was kind of a similar

201
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:25,918
technique that I was using

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,720
do you prefer to make like cherry

203
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:33,360
tomatoes or heirloom big beefy ones

204
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,200
um dude I have 75 eating those that's

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,200
for eating uh

206
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,260
probably like a cherry

207
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,039
tomato

208
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,899
same yeah unless I'm feeling like if I'm

209
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,559
doing a BLT you know I gotta have a big

210
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:53,399
steak tomato yeah yeah of course

211
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:56,579
so for me like you talk about moving out

212
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,159
how how quickly did you get your hands

213
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:04,560
on other kinds of genetics

214
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:06,659
and uh so I the first couple times I

215
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,899
tried to get seeds

216
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:12,778
um I would I dealt with seed banks that

217
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:16,039
I think I dealt with Mark Emery

218
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:18,539
um pretty early on sent money to Canada

219
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,278
was you know a hoof and a dream and

220
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,120
didn't get [ __ ]

221
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,778
um

222
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
and had a kind of follow-up

223
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:28,559
um

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,060
pretty similar uh I didn't really start

225
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:37,379
getting anything until

226
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:40,159
I went to the Dutch you know or the UK I

227
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:43,559
I did stuff that was reasonably cheap

228
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,958
Nirvana Casey brains that kind of stuff

229
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,539
a little bit of Scentsy

230
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,838
um but ordering it through seeds direct

231
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:55,139
or one of those you know guys in the UK

232
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,339
yeah so I didn't really

233
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:01,799
start with that uh until

234
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,220
I moved out and

235
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,179
that was I think

236
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,519
um

237
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,500
I was gonna say

238
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,139
um yeah that was about what I found

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,958
overgrow so I kind of had a little bit

240
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,958
more knowledge as to what I wanted as

241
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,559
you know what I could finish

242
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,739
um

243
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,599
all of that and I get you know I'd get

244
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,180
cheaper stuff like Nirvana and Casey

245
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,680
brains for my outdoor grows and you know

246
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,659
if I was going to do some stuff inside

247
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,000
where I could back up plants I would

248
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,039
Splurge a little bit and get a cheap

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,039
pack of CC's or something

250
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,860
Casey brings for the outdoor win

251
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,240
yeah that that stuff was solid I wish I

252
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,919
still had some

253
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,899
well yeah I wanted to ask you about that

254
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,479
too because Matt Matt does have a bunch

255
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,879
of questions for you about the forums

256
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,339
but before that I did want to ask out of

257
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,240
these early packs uh what were some of

258
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,240
the highlights that you remember

259
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,959
um I liked the KC 36 a lot I did really

260
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,740
well outdoor here

261
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,319
um

262
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,680
just good I mean you know looking back

263
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,240
on it it was all very Justified uh you

264
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,879
know all the Nirvana stuff seemed like

265
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,539
it was a skunk one cross

266
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,320
um

267
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,578
their their turban poison I did a lot I

268
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,180
really liked

269
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:25,439
um

270
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:27,539
their white rhino I grew a bit indoor

271
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,399
and really liked that uh for the potency

272
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,458
the flavor

273
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,039
didn't do much for me with white rhino

274
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:38,838
White Widow any of those white

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,838
um but the potency was there

276
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,880
um

277
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,600
so that kind of stuff really the first

278
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:48,600
seeds that I grew and I really was kind

279
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,420
of head over heels for them were um some

280
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,360
free seeds I got from evergrow from

281
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,799
there's a guy jlp that would give away

282
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,919
seeds

283
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,159
um and I grew a bunch of his lines over

284
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,620
the years you know you just be an active

285
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,219
member send them a message and he'd send

286
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,459
you some free seeds so he had um

287
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,278
he had a couple lines that grew uh Romeo

288
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,259
and Juliet was one he had one called

289
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,240
Phoenix Hayes that was like a Neville's

290
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,759
hay Super Silver Haze it was really good

291
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,240
yeah that was in the um that was in that

292
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,639
the the afro pits

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,399
um Senegal Haze at the Phoenix oh really

294
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,360
yeah oh cool yeah that was an awesome

295
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,740
plan

296
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,379
um yeah I love that

297
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,720
it was um you know

298
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,120
pretty heavy on the Neville's Haze I

299
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,579
think it was something like

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,078
you know Dutch grown got busted and the

301
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:45,479
seeds were collected and so they were

302
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,939
either Neville's Haze or Neville's

303
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,820
across the super silver haze and yeah he

304
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,380
he inbred it from there and um it was

305
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,778
just there were some phenomenal plants

306
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,259
in those they're bad

307
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:01,458
pedimore right jlp yep John Lee

308
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,458
pettimore yeah

309
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,039
um

310
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,839
at the forums did you already have did

311
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,778
you already get the name heinle so how

312
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:14,399
did you come to that name

313
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:17,278
um that name I didn't use it on overgrow

314
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,720
I wasn't as active on overgrow I was

315
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,419
kind of

316
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,220
pretty sketched out by it I had a

317
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:26,219
different handle

318
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,259
um but when I when that went down I kind

319
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,339
of freaked out for a little bit and you

320
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,639
know I thought everybody's getting

321
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,560
busted and all that and then when I

322
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,100
signed up for

323
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,199
I see mag I was

324
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,440
um really into

325
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,600
bluegrass music at the time and

326
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,300
um you know the highlands and sound that

327
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,579
was something that you know that's the

328
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,559
way people described the sound of the

329
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:55,199
Stanley Brothers which is you know a

330
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,119
kind of first generation bluegrass band

331
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,940
from Virginia

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,879
and so it's kind of a play on that

333
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,320
that's why I chose it and you know I

334
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,578
don't know in retrospect I probably

335
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,519
could have come up with something cooler

336
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:10,439
but that's uh that's what I got

337
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,278
I think that's a great name it's pretty

338
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,380
cool it's pretty [ __ ] cool a lot

339
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,179
that's a good story too I forget that

340
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,179
like uh Bluegrass culture a lot of it

341
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,899
is Eastern Area yeah there that's uh

342
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,260
Southwest Virginia and um yeah right

343
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,639
yeah Kentucky's the Bluegrass State

344
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,819
um that's where

345
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,039
that's where it kind of all started

346
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,500
um but yeah Kentucky intensity Southwest

347
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,500
Virginia North Carolina all that

348
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,800
very cool nice

349
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,259
yeah

350
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:51,838
Matt did you want to ask about yeah

351
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,399
all right so we have uh we've talked

352
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,139
about overgrowth talked about icy mag

353
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,839
are there any other early forums that

354
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,600
you can think of that um we're kind of

355
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,399
influential in your uh Growing

356
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,040
Experience or like online learning

357
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,639
experience that we have mentioned

358
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,679
uh the only other one I would say of

359
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,220
great significance to me would be

360
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,559
mechanic Cabana which

361
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,560
people that

362
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,500
um were getting frequently banned from

363
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,778
icdmag kind of started going over there

364
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,299
I had a bunch of

365
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,980
friends from the forums that were over

366
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,519
there and they kind of turned me onto it

367
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,920
but that was a smaller Forum but a ton

368
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,799
of knowledge there and people that you

369
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,259
know it didn't have nearly as many you

370
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,838
know 17 year old kids showing up trying

371
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,879
to find weed it was it was Growers

372
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,459
discussing

373
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,159
the real deal you know yeah so that one

374
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:53,159
was was pretty big for me

375
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,198
um for years uh and then you know there

376
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,958
were there were quite a few other

377
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,059
smaller ones that I was on but

378
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,059
um Buchanan command is definitely the

379
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:06,179
the only one other than I see mag that

380
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:08,819
uh was a major influence on me

381
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,198

385
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,198
you I can write it down if not

386
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,139
um I wrote down early friends and allies

387
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,838
on the forums so like early friends

388
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,180

uh yeah I had quite a few

393
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,179
um

394
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,198

know how active they are nowadays and I

396

saying their names yeah yeah well you

399
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:55,019
know there there were a few like um I

400
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:57,120
met a local guy who went by uh stretch

401
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,459
puppy on the forums he was a good friend

402
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,698
of mine we became pretty close and

403
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:05,279
we shared a lot of genetics and

404
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:07,980
um you know we both learned quite a bit

405
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,899
from each other we all have out of it he

406
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,620
was a bit north of me

407
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,919
um

408
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:17,759
he he drew some really cool stuff we

409
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,220
shared a ton of genetics and he uh

410
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,459
yeah he was just a cool guy he was

411
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,240
he was blowing it up back then in a area

412
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:29,519
where I probably wouldn't have

413
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,019
that's gangster but he's uh he's the

414
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,160
first guy who showed me the Fairfax

415
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,720
four-way

416
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,558
oh wow

417
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,500
and he was getting bags of it

418
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,779
um but he couldn't

419
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,579
um you know couldn't get to cut it was

420
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,538
it was held down we didn't know the

421
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:47,159
right people

422
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,558
and he um

423
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,538
he actually bought

424
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:54,599
um some packs of the Nirvana four-way

425
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,339
and he popped a packet and he found a

426
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,959
Dead Ringer of the plant it was

427
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,699
incredible

428
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,980
it um

429
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,038
it was it

430
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,360
was just a phenomenal plant it was very

431
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,819
um

432
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,058
very similar to some of that Rubber City

433
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,980
stuff

434
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:15,899
the way the heads work

435
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,779
um the way the heads develop on the

436
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,538
plants um it was it was a hell of a line

437
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:24,779
I wish I had 10 packs of that you know

438
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:26,460
um but no kidding yeah back then it was

439
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,200
like oh it's just Nirvana I'll buy the

440
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,220
real things and see if I really want to

441
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,279
find it

442
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,740
right and it'll always be around forever

443
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,599
yeah yeah now it's not available I've

444
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,740
reached out to them they don't have it

445
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:42,839
um yeah sucks of course of course of

446
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,460
course right yeah no that's interesting

447
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,798
you mentioned the Fairfax far away I

448
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,819
know since you uh mentioned it a lot of

449
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,319
people are going to be watching are

450
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,960
going to be the a boys

451
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,599
um do you have any uh Recollections of

452
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,579
it or remembrances of of how it was back

453
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,279
then

454
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:02,699
I really don't it's uh that was a long

455
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:05,339
time ago it was like that dude it was

456
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,259
just this was this was in the era where

457
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,418
you know most commercially available

458
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,140
stuff with beasters

459
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,500
um

460
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,940
so it was you know it stood out because

461
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,179
it was

462
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,038
locally grown high quality I would

463
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,400
imagine so

464
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,859
yeah it you know today

465
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,600
it would probably be really cool for me

466
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:29,939
I'd really get into it but it doesn't

467
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:34,019
seem like something that would be

468
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,840
you know in a dispensary in Denver it's

469
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,519
not it's not a modern thing

470
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,439
last I heard they were cleaning the cut

471
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,259
up I wonder where it's at it should be

472
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,880
through that status now

473
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:50,160
be cool to see yeah post post uh hplv

474

475
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,558

Scentsy star I remember that being

489
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,320
devastatingly potent the first time I

490
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,140

491
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,099

502
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:02,639
was six hundred dollars so I mean it was

503
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:05,279
it was very very marketable

504
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,620
um and so you know

505
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,418
that started showing up I smoked and was

506
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,298
like holy [ __ ]

507
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,400
um and luckily I had

508
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:16,918
made some friends through the forums

509
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,340
that I could source to cut through and

510
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,940
um and I yeah I fell in love with that

511
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:26,459
one I bet that's that's a game changer

512
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:31,340
especially for that era in time

513
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,340
yeah [ __ ] I still smoke it all the time

514
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,400
um there's something that I wanted to

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,679
ask you and and it's kind of a little

516
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,679
bit of a tangent but it's in the same

517
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,380
realm what are some of the other old uh

518
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,340
Virginia clones you can think of that

519
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,720
light you'd like to nod to in this uh

520
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,899
episode

521
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,900
foreign

522
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,240
it wasn't

523
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:00,538
like out west you know it was very small

524
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,140
Circles of people so there wasn't

525
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:06,538
there wasn't a ton of trading

526
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,840
um you know you'd see

527
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:14,038
the Ganny from Virginia Beach sometimes

528
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,019
um yeah that which there were other

529
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,819
candies in the state that people were

530
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,879
growing there was one in Southwest

531
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,339
Virginia that was incredible

532
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,120
um but you would see stuff like that it

533
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,839
was mostly cuts of Siege lines yeah it

534
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,899
wasn't

535
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:35,158
it wasn't stuff with mysterious Origins

536
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,980
and all of that it was afghani's

537
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,860
um there was a the Urban Poison cut in

538
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,058
my area for a while but mostly the cut

539
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,099
game

540
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:47,579
started happening

541
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:49,859
around the time that you know the price

542
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,819
gouging was going on in Northern

543
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:52,859
Virginia

544
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,298
um yeah Saturday's a little train wreck

545
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,939
that kind of stuff

546
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,500
was going for insane monies how people

547
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,440
started

548
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,419
um growing that stuff locally and

549
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,580
cashing in very much

550
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,200
I can't even imagine seeing train wreck

551
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,699
over there for the first time because

552
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
it's so vastly different than a lot of

553
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,120
the wheat over there

554
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,779
oh yeah yeah that was

555
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:19,739
that when that hit the area it had you

556
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,339
know it was on top for years and I bet

557
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,779
um

558
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:27,538
you know it was mostly import from

559
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:29,879
Northern California and yeah the joke

560
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:33,119
the joke was always what doesn't sell in

561
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,179
California it gets hit East

562
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,459
um so the the quality wasn't there but

563
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,679
it was unmistakably trading rack you

564
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,419
could tell I mean anybody that's grown

565
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,740
it could see it

566
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:49,259
um but man if you had if you had a jar

567
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,359
of like really nice well-grown indoor

568
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,158
train wreck and you cracked that you

569
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,058
would [ __ ] blow people's minds back

570
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,700
then oh I bet dude I bet uh

571
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:03,178
so yeah that was that was cool but it

572
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,019
was also you know in that that era

573
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,360
um

574
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,798
you kind of had to watch who you pulled

575
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,779
that [ __ ] out around

576
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,700
like um

577
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,798
you know you couldn't go to a party and

578
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,600
open a jar of sour these were a train

579
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,279
rack because then everybody would be

580
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,538
like oh what is this where where did you

581
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,339
get this you know yeah it was so yeah it

582
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:26,359
was

583
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:28,619
kind of weird cool guy to Mark real fast

584
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,538
yeah so

585
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,339
um you know it was

586
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,720
it was like when you're going out to the

587
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,119
party or hang out with some friends you

588
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,940
grab a bag of City weed that you bought

589
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:42,418
off somebody just to keep a low profile

590
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,298
it was bad yeah that sucks

591
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,299
yeah you can't even flash a good [ __ ] in

592
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:51,019
front of the chicks well you know you

593
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:55,259
could but yeah yeah

594
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:58,139
no yeah sure yeah for sure for sure so

595
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:00,599
um you know you had to be reserved to

596
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,200
make it yeah

597
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,959
um

598
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,179
to make it through the drug war

599
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,380
yeah and it was great power comes great

600
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,640
responsibility huh exactly yeah chicks

601
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,500
are always the first way dudes get

602
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,780
caught anyways now that I think about it

603
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,380
so yeah that makes a lot of sense

604
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,379
yeah yeah

605
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,319
um Matt you had a note here about the

606
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:26,759
infamous chem 101 thread on I see yes

607
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,038
all right

608
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,940
um yeah so can we talk about like some

609
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:35,158
of your um your first experiences with

610
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,659
even hearing of Cam what what started

611
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,760
that journey into trying to track down

612
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,278
the history because like a lot if people

613
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,099
aren't aware like some of my first

614
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,980
intros into reading on the forums about

615
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:49,199
like digging into a history was like the

616
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,599
chem 101 thread for me so it was it's

617
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,058
pretty important in my learning and

618
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,519
overall how we ended up here at this

619
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:58,079
point overall so what what put you on

620
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,798
that Journey

621
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:04,678
uh so at that time

622
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,418
um you know I had sourdes a witch there

623
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,320
were various theories floating around

624
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:11,580
about how that was related to uh Kim dog

625
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,000
yeah

626
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:17,460
um I had a you know Kim dog bag seed

627
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,778
cross that I was growing that was you

628
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,960
know pretty

629
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,579
pretty close to

630
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,519
um you know what a lot of people know is

631
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:29,220
like a KMD hybrid now yeah

632
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,278
um so I I was trying

633
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,900
even pretty much from the jump with Kim

634
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,319
dog online there was a ton of

635
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,820
misinformation a ton of people trying to

636
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:43,259
you know

637
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:45,480
get credit for it so yeah I I started

638
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,619
trying to compile what information was

639
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,679
available

640
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,459
talk to the people that were closest to

641
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,620
you know

642
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,778
to the whole thing the Kim Fam guys I

643
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,939
guess they would be called now yeah

644
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:59,038
um and try to get kind of a

645
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,759
straightforward

646
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,158
um

647
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,519
you know just a breakdown of the family

648
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,278
and and how it was all together and I

649
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,139
was you know I was looking at this [ __ ]

650
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,240
researching and talking to people every

651
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,799
night and I was like well [ __ ] you know

652
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,720
if I'm doing all this I might as well

653
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,819
put it down so the next guy that wants

654
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,700
to know what the [ __ ] going on can I

655
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:24,538
look it up and figure it out

656
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,259
um So after talking to various people

657
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,140
um

658
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,658
you know at the time on the Forum you

659
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,620
could talk to Joe brand you could talk

660
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,799
to

661
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:36,839
Peabody Kim dog Greg was on there

662
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,240
um who else

663
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,158
JJ was on there yeah a bunch of people

664
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,099
that were

665
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:48,059
um you know relevant in that world were

666
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:50,519
there to to discuss so I basically took

667
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:54,119
the information

668
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,339
as best I could and and put it together

669
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,579
you know looking back on it there are

670
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:02,339
definitely some flaws in it um but at

671
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:05,460
the time it was the information that was

672
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:08,459
available as well as I could present it

673
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,100
I mean it's like it really is still the

674
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,919
best information as anybody could

675
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,778
present it as given by the people who

676
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,140
told it

677
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:21,419
yeah sure it's accurate to that to that

678
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,640
extent and that's that's probably the

679
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,700
most important part I think

680
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,640
yeah yeah it was um

681
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,038
it was it was a cool thread I you know I

682
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,500
talked to inspector a bunch about it and

683
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:37,140
I remember I when I posted it you know

684
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,480
he came on and I think his first post on

685
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,278
the thread was you know if you're gonna

686
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,720
talk about Kim 91 you ought to have a

687
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,519
picture of the real one and he posted

688
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,419
because the picture that I had used was

689
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,980
from Joe brand and it wasn't it wasn't

690
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,600
kim91

691
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,880
um but at that time

692
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,699
at that time I had no experience with it

693
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,600
it was still sure a very tightly held

694
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,360
cut so um you know pay for effort right

695
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,579
well I mean and Joe brand was the source

696
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,079
of the seed so like him posting a

697
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,538
picture at chem 91 you would assume

698
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,778
would be a great source for the picture

699
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:17,640
you know yeah I mean yeah at that time

700
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:20,880
that was yeah that's straight from the

701
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,799
horse's mouth you know yeah exactly no I

702
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,419
I it's always fascinated me to know what

703
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,058
puts you on that Journey because it's

704
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,820
it's a lot of how we ended up like even

705
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,619
here at this point discussing this kind

706
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,678
of stuff together now so it's pretty

707
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:36,658
cool yeah and and it's still really

708
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,559
yeah yeah

709
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:42,480
for someone to come in like me in what

710
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,940
2019 2020 and to go and look at that

711
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,919
thread is still really remarkable

712
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,960
um yeah and the number of you know like

713
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,399
people who are now very notable figures

714
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,679
in the community

715
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,658
um that were in that participating like

716
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,200
that that's kind of amazing

717
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,299
yeah it was it was a uh it was a smaller

718
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,120
world back then

719
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,339
yeah and it's still the best place to go

720
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,038
look at all the pictures is like the one

721
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,480
through four two which is cool yeah

722
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:11,940
absolutely hard to find pictures of

723
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,419
anywhere uh at least the one yeah that

724
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,240
was um yeah that was right after uh

725
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,340
inspector had run them all and so he had

726
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,579
pictures that he let me use for the

727
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:25,500
thread and um yeah it was it was pretty

728
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,658
remarkable I'm still

729
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,880
kind of bummed I never got to try the

730
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,340
two and the three but uh you know yeah

731
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,559
what are you gonna do

732
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:36,898
the two the two has always interested me

733
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,819
because it's it's Bunch structure being

734
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:41,219
so uniquely different than all of them

735
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:44,220
you know little tiny budlets as opposed

736
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,500
to yeah everything else I don't know it

737
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,179
just always seemed more unique than the

738
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,880
rest yeah it was but um I remember

739
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:57,240
uh inspector did he crossed them all to

740
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,179
deep chunk and yeah chrome chrome ran

741
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,500
out the chem two deep jump and there was

742
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,679
a plant in there

743
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:09,599
that was like strikingly similar to

744
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:12,000
kim91 and wow yeah it it at least

745
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,819
visually and that kind of always

746
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,700
you know I just I've always thought

747
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,480
about that I know man I wish I could

748
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,480
have gotten those to pop

749
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:28,500
is this a good time for us to also ask

750
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,719
you about what you might consider your

751
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,058
first breeding projects like actual

752
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,940
breeding projects is does that happen in

753
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,379
a similar time to the thread

754
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:43,259
um well you know

755
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:45,600
really I've always kind of done it um

756
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,440
I I've messed with breeding different

757
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,879
Mexicans trying to get away from

758
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,038
hermaphroditic plants

759
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,899
um pretty much

760
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,700
the second year I was growing it was

761
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:59,339
something that I always kind of messed

762
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,259
with had found the mail that seems solid

763
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:05,819
I would I would save it

764
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:07,740
um I never had any intentions in into

765
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,839
really getting into breeding it was

766
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,759
always just kind of something that came

767
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,798
with the territory for somebody that was

768
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,099
obsessed with with weed

769
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:20,940
um and really the

770
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:23,459
the first thing of note I did was

771
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,340
um you know this stuff was praise dog

772
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,960
and I passed it to some friends that I

773
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,418
traded seeds with back then you know

774
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,538
Bodie and I talked a lot on the forums

775
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:36,299
or several other people 40 credit

776
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:38,759
um you know a bunch of guys that I

777
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:42,000
I would just swap some seeds with and

778
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,038
you know [ __ ] along and uh that was

779
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,859
the first

780
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:49,379
um the first thing of note that I ever

781
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,759
did before that it was mostly just kind

782
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,620
of

783
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,379
um you know I'm gonna cross this Mexican

784
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:57,178
to this Phoenix Haze or I'm going to

785
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,799
cross this Mexican to this other one and

786
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,159
try to get

787
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,538
rid of the hermaphrodite you know but

788
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,299
um yeah I would say that's the first

789
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:08,759
thing of note that I I really did

790
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,980
what all did you do with the trade-off

791
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:17,220
or I'm sorry yeah trade on

792
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:21,960
uh so at that time I had a pretty good

793
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:25,319
um stable of cuts and I was growing

794
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,899
um growing those seeds from JJ

795
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,859
um he and I had traded some stuff and I

796
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:31,139
had

797
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:32,519
some of those seeds I was growing some

798
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,059
of his

799
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,058
um

800
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:38,099
Nigerian silver that cross I was growing

801
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:42,480
a few a few different things at the time

802
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:44,759
and um I found a male in a trace talk

803
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,220
that I was really impressed with I was

804
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,440
impressed with you know the structure of

805
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,899
it the bigger the

806
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,778
um you know Kim he can be kind of floppy

807
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:56,398
but it was had a really nice rigid

808
00:33:54,778 --> 00:34:00,599
structure

809
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:04,739
um and so I I kept it and

810
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:08,338
um there were a number of plants that I

811
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:12,719
really liked but they were missing

812
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,980
certain things so I basically just hit

813
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,898
you know

814
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,800
hit some plants with it I hit Green

815
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:23,519
Crack I hit purple Urkel I hit

816
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,839
um the Kim D and Kim four that I had I

817
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,039
hit

818
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,219
um

819
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,259
abusive as you Kush I had an Acapulco

820
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,838
Gold that I hit

821
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:37,260
um just kind of a mix a mixture of stuff

822
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:40,320
and I pretty much gave all the seeds

823
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,000
away I kept a few for myself but mostly

824
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,980
it was just you know

825
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,398
just giving them to my friends

826
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,280
so for clarity here what is the Tres dog

827
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:55,259
that is a Tim Dog D

828
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:58,080
um vx2 to JJ NYC made

829
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,599
um and I'm not sure

830
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,179
if it was I don't know if the Original

831
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,460
Seed line was released

832
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:06,960
um because this was before top dog

833
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,260
launched

834
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,720
um I'm not sure if he I know he released

835
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,460
an in-cross of it later but I I believe

836
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,759
when he

837
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,159
um you know started his company it was a

838
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,140
star dog is what kind of launched

839
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,219
launched the Kim lines if I'm not

840
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:27,000
mistaken

841
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,078
how so what mail did he use for the

842
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,858
president

843
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,960
it was a

844
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:36,838
sincere

845
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:41,460
yep yeah that was the outcross yeah yeah

846
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:44,338
so he used the Afghan one and then uh

847
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,460
and then res pretty much copied him and

848
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:48,119
used the Scentsy Hindu Kush

849
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,159
um

850
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:54,838
but JJ was the the first one to have a

851
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:57,480
kimchi type c line

852
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,820
you know that like going back I got to

853
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,039
give him props on knowing to use Afghani

854
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,960
one or or a type of plant like that to

855
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,838
that cross sorry it's using a back cross

856
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,820
like that like yeah looking back at how

857
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:10,440
many people have made epic fails if that

858
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,780
crosses like that's actually probably a

859
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,838
pretty good choice to use in that

860
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:19,200
yeah he um he did a great job with it I

861
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:22,619
you know I had that male plant that I

862
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:25,379
kept for a little bit and then I had a

863
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:27,960
female from it that was phenomenal as

864
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,780
well it was like a um

865
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,139
it was like a it had the kimdi potency

866
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:37,560
but it was a little bit creamier like um

867
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:41,519
it it's most reminiscent to me of like

868
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:43,679
if you grow TMD outside

869
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,539
um okay it's still it's still really

870
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,940
funky but it has this kind of sweet

871
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:50,159
creaminess to it especially as it starts

872
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,200
to occur pure a little bit

873
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,299
um and that

874
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,719
that came through pretty strong on the

875
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,720
trace dog

876
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,440
um but yeah it was a it was a great line

877
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,019
I

878
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,539
um I hit it to a bunch of stuff

879
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,719
and uh yeah sounds it got kind of

880
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,699
popular yeah the dog's Waltz uh notably

881
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,679
the poodle nuts cut now that was found

882
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:16,799
by 40 Grit

883
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,819
yeah 40 grit 40 ounce grown nut he had a

884
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,780
bunch of names

885
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,280
um yeah

886
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,200
on the forums he so he was

887
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,280
um a good buddy of mine that I met

888
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,919
through

889
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,320
yeah either overgrow or I see nag and he

890
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,139
he was like the first dude that was like

891
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,900
blowing up warehouses and posting

892
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:39,420
pictures of it he was growing you know a

893
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,760
warehouse of Urkel in the Bay Area and

894
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,519
just you know crushing it his

895
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,800
his Oracle was the best that I ever

896
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,838
smoked it was incredible

897
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,079
um he just nailed it but you know he was

898
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,139
always looking for for something that

899
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,060
grew faster because

900
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:59,519
if you're doing lights and lights of

901
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,440
Urkel you know your veg time is for

902
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,838
[ __ ] ever

903
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,760
um so when I was

904
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,380
um you know when I was making this seeds

905
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,760
I had an Urkel and I was like you know

906
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,420
what I'm gonna pollinate that one just

907
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,940
for just for my boy 40. and so yeah I

908
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,338
sent I sent him a bunch of seeds and he

909
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,159
popped them and uh yeah he found that

910
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:22,739
cut that he called the poodle nuts

911
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,338
and uh it still floats around

912
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,858
yeah I I remember my first encounter

913
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,539
with that was with uh a bunch of the

914
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:32,519
Colorado people I noticed it getting

915
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:34,320
really big in Denver when the Denver

916
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:38,039
medical scene came on

917
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,039
and I know um what's his name uh Tiara

918
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:42,480
Rojo Phil filthier Rojo he was blowing

919
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,920
it up with that thing and that's when I

920
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,619
was like God what is this because it was

921
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,780
super unique looking and like to me it's

922
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,400
uh and you'll probably hate that I say

923
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,780
this but it reminds me of like something

924
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,900
as unique

925
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,119
and different looking as cookies would

926
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,858
have been at the same time like looking

927
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,559
at them how different they both look

928
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:03,179
from normal standard butt around it

929
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,820
could have easily caught on the hype of

930
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:07,440
that in my opinion and you know like it

931
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,359
was almost going in that direction in

932
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,940
Denver it just never quite got the

933
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,039
cookie smash yeah it was unique

934
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,440
yeah yeah there were there were several

935
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,699
guys in Denver that grew it it still has

936
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,500
um

937
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:20,460
still has a pretty good reputation there

938
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,820
I actually

939
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,880
um I went to a dispensary here a year or

940
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,519
two ago and um I was meeting a friend

941
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,079
that ran the dispensary and he was

942
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,940
telling the people in the shop I mean

943
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,820
this is the guy that did dogs Waltz and

944
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:41,039
they were all like oh man you know that

945
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,039
was I was like damn man yeah

946
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,199
I've got two questions here so just to

947
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,420
be clear that the dogs Waltz is Urkel by

948
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:51,539
Tres dog is that right yes

949
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,039
okay and would this be would you

950
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,199
consider this the moment where you were

951
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,440
starting to get exposure for the first

952
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,439
time

953
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,740
um

954
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,358
no I wouldn't say that because it was

955
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,838
still you know

956
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,279
it was Forum exposure it wasn't like it

957
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,239
was

958
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,780
um

959
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,819
it wasn't like it was winning a cup or

960
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,760
anything like that it was you know the

961
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,500
people that I already knew and respected

962
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,200
saw that I made something that was cool

963
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,539
so it was more like it was more like

964
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:27,358
just getting getting the respect of my

965
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:30,960
peers and people that I looked up to

966
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,199
um yeah yeah the the moment that I kind

967
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,480
of I guess

968
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,919
became Infamous in the in the Cannabis

969
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,858
world was

970
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,960
um when 30 started using the Appalachian

971
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,940
stuff

972
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,760
is it time for us to talk about the

973
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,760
Appalachia I mean even the name I mean

974
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,920
we uh it might be one thing before that

975
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:58,079
and I you can correct me if I'm wrong

976
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:00,720
but the skunk magazine sub cool

977
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,579
um retraction was that part of

978
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,000
Appalachia

979
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:10,980
uh yeah the when he published the Kim

980
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,320
101 in Skunk magazine yes yeah that was

981
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,900
um that was kind of wild to me because

982
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,480
you know at the time I was just a dude

983
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,599
that had a couple whites in his house

984
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,300
and did some gorilla grows and you know

985
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,760
just some dude and I'd go to the

986
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,519
bookstore and pick up the weed magazines

987
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,540
every once in a while because you know I

988
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,659
wasn't getting that [ __ ] in the mail

989
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:35,759
yeah and that's it I've hooked it up one

990
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:38,879
day and started reading it and I was

991
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,400
like God damn this is word for word my

992
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,099
thread for my city mag that's kind of

993
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,000
[ __ ] up and you know

994
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:51,359
I I wasn't the biggest fan of him anyway

995
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,800
so yeah you know it kind of rubbed me

996
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,219
wrong

997
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,440
um so I I remember looking up the email

998
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,000
for them and I emailed them and linked

999
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,000
them to the thread

1000
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
and they were of course super apologetic

1001
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,079
and they were like we're gonna dock him

1002
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,099
on the next article and we're gonna send

1003
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,260
you

1004
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,220
the amount and it was it was something

1005
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,800
ridiculous it was like more

1006
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:19,199
uh it was more for just getting it

1007
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,720
corrected I think yeah I think they they

1008
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,279
sent me a check for like 70 bucks or

1009
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,279
something that I never passed

1010
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,980
but it was more for like you know peace

1011
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,420
of mind I guess I had to frame that [ __ ]

1012
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,820
you know I was just thinking I don't

1013
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,720
know whatever happened to it

1014
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,940
um but yeah I probably should have yeah

1015
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,799
that's funny funny um artifact to find

1016
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,260
if you have yeah right

1017
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,700
yeah yeah I have no idea what that would

1018
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,579
be

1019
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:52,439
and then there's another one that that I

1020
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:55,440
know CSI would want me to bring up

1021
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,500
before we move on and I think that

1022
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
before Appalachia and that's the the

1023
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,420
infamous icy mag Banning of high and

1024
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,939
Lonesome where like

1025
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,680
everybody kind of decided they were

1026
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,740
going to start pulling their threads and

1027
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,838
[ __ ] because they banned you

1028
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,699
yeah I got fans

1029
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:19,019
I can't remember

1030
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:21,118
it might have been in the gym 101 thread

1031
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:23,940
um but basically it was

1032
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:28,440
having a bit of a back and forth with

1033
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,579
old res dog all right I see Mac and this

1034
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,260
you know

1035
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:34,019
this wasn't even

1036
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,420
you know this was pretty

1037
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,699
government informant rest dog this was

1038
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,119
just you know he's he's a giant [ __ ]

1039
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,858
and yeah yeah

1040
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,700
so so you know I had a couple back and

1041
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:50,159
forths with him on the forums and that

1042
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:52,739
was you know Jesse Nirvana's number one

1043
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,139
Cash Cow so

1044
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,379
basically if you talk [ __ ] to him you

1045
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:01,078
got yanked and he was just an arrogant

1046
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,660
prick and as far as I can tell he still

1047
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,680
is but you know now he's also

1048
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:09,480
they confirm rat so you know

1049
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,879
I

1050
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,740
I would get banned again over that [ __ ]

1051
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,260
whatever

1052
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:18,000
so the rest of the story goes that

1053
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,140
everybody else on not everybody

1054
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,358
obviously

1055
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:24,179
a bunch of the respected guys on icy mag

1056
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,519
including CSI who had you know hundreds

1057
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:29,358
and hundreds of pages of amazing Growers

1058
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:32,219
up there just started deleting them

1059
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,078
to try to get you back you know I did it

1060
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:36,719
worked eventually didn't it

1061
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,220
uh no I had to I waited a while and then

1062
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,500
I was like [ __ ] it I'm gonna sign back

1063
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:43,919
up and I signed back up and they banned

1064
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,039
me and then I I I eventually did it

1065
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,079
again just to see and I think I still

1066
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,380
currently have an account there

1067
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:55,019
yeah I never never used it but

1068
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,119
they always got me bro they always got

1069
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:58,800
me but I always had riot in the name

1070
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,460
somewhere you know

1071
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,980
yeah yeah and you know it was it was a

1072
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,500
marketing thing it was it was how he

1073
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,960
sold seeds and if you [ __ ] with his

1074
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,239
money you were gone

1075
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,240
that tended to be most of the the the

1076
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,759
the way with forums though like most

1077
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,858
forums seem to have some sort of seed

1078
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,020
bank eventually connected to it and then

1079
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:24,000
you know they had their top dog and if

1080
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:26,639
you messed with that then there was an

1081
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,199
issue here almost always yeah it was

1082
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,000
always fun and that's

1083
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:33,000
and that's the reason a lot of people

1084
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,858
like CSI and myself and

1085
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,960
um many others kind of went to the

1086
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:41,159
Canada Cabana because it was yeah it

1087
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,900
wasn't a it wasn't a seed banks Forum

1088
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,980
you could kind of discuss what you

1089
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,579
wanted

1090
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,519
um

1091
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,740
just without a lot of the politics yeah

1092
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,179
yeah command is cool

1093
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,939
yeah

1094
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:55,318
all right I think now we can head in if

1095
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,639
you want

1096
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:58,739
sure

1097
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,219
um I did have one last thing on the

1098
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:06,239
forums which is in 2023 are there forums

1099
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:09,838
that are still relevant in like to you

1100
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:13,679
um there's good information on I see mag

1101
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:16,440
still it's um it's difficult because

1102
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,759
as people got banned a couple things

1103
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,679
would happen

1104
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,140
um they would either have their post

1105
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:25,259
left up without their name on it so it

1106
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:28,279
just says yes so uh on some of those

1107
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,780
older threads you don't really know

1108
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,839
who's comments you're reading you don't

1109
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,040
know whether to put a lot of weight into

1110
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,659
them

1111
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,119
um they

1112
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:41,159
they there is a good amount of relevant

1113
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,300
information there

1114
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:44,759
um it's

1115
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,380
it's a bit Antiquated at this point it's

1116
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,500
a lot of you know

1117
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:52,260
a lot of guys that are doing [ __ ] in

1118
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,019
illegal States wiring up you know a

1119
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,000
couple

1120
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:59,460
250 watt HPS lights or something it's a

1121
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,338
lot of you know as a home grower I think

1122
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,838
it has a lot a lot of good material but

1123
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:06,838
if you're um

1124
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,639
if you're doing anything big it's pretty

1125
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,519
antiquated

1126
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,879
yep that sounds better um

1127
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,579
and then I don't know I haven't I

1128
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,539
haven't checked out a lot of the others

1129
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,359
um

1130
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:23,099
mechanic event is still around I know

1131
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,699
like roll it up is still around I

1132
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,359
haven't I've I went on there to

1133
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,358
um

1134
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,098
follow a thread uh where somebody was

1135
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:33,960
growing some of my stuff and it was

1136
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,640
pretty cool but you know I'm not active

1137
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,079
on any of them I

1138
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:42,420
I don't have a ton of extra time like I

1139
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,260
did when I was younger

1140
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,480
yep yep okay well I I think we can segue

1141
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,060
it now to the Appalachia

1142
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,119
um so

1143
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:57,980
from the time that you first made the

1144
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,980
cross like how long has it been

1145
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:03,960
um

1146
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,760
it was 2007 when I made it so it has

1147
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,519
been

1148
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,520
what 16 years wow yeah

1149
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,838
yeah so it's you know for me

1150
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,460
a lot of people are really excited about

1151
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,519
it but for me it's like it's something

1152
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,800
that I made and I pretty much grown it

1153
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:26,579
ever since then

1154
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,318
um it does really well and multiple

1155
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,519
applications for me so it's something

1156
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,739
you know

1157
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,619
does well outside does well enough

1158
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:37,500
Greenhouse does well indoors so I've

1159
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:40,680
kind of always always done it

1160
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,420
um and I usually make seeds with it most

1161
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,419
of them just kind of hang out in my

1162
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,940
fridge until I it's awesome or something

1163
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,099
um but yeah it's

1164
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,720
it's an older line but it's it's a good

1165
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:54,420
one

1166
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,219
I want to ask you about maybe what you

1167
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,960
perceive to be the different stages that

1168
00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:00,779
project's been through but just before

1169
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,338
that I want to ask about the name you

1170
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,780
know why did you call it Appalachia I

1171
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:07,619
know you already talked about how high

1172
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:10,380
in Lonesome is drawn from bluegrass

1173
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:13,858
um yeah Appalachia tell us about that

1174
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:18,838
uh really it was because

1175
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:20,279
I was hoping to find something that was

1176
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,139
um

1177
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,160
a little more solid for what I wanted

1178
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:28,679
outdoor and that's a time I was doing my

1179
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,219
outdoor grows in that region so I was

1180
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:33,598
kind of hoping for something that was

1181
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,259
regionally appropriate

1182
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,500
um

1183
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,960
a lot of the stuff that was popular on

1184
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,300
the west coast and popular in you know

1185
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,240
Spain or places like that didn't really

1186
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,400
cross over we have a different climate

1187
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:48,179
we have a lot more humidity

1188
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,639
um

1189
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:52,679
earlier Frost in a lot of places so a

1190
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,618
lot of the stuff that was marketed for

1191
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,578
out for wasn't really well suited to the

1192
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:58,318
area

1193
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:01,859
so I kind of just

1194
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:05,099
uh called it Appalachia because Green

1195
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:07,679
Crack was one that I grew a lot outside

1196
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,200
and

1197
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:13,019
that I was hoping to improve it with the

1198
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,179
trace dog Green Crack has some issues

1199
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,960
outside it

1200
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:22,739
if you let it go to where I like it you

1201
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,539
know it's it likes to rot it's it's a

1202
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,699
very fast plant though so you can get

1203
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:28,980
away with it by by taking it early it

1204
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:31,259
triggers pretty early here

1205
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,719
um and you can get it eight weeks

1206
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,720
without any issues I like to take it 10

1207
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:40,379
weeks and man if you leave it out out

1208
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,939
here that long it's you know it's you're

1209
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,818
losing half of it

1210
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,920
can you um first for like an indoor

1211
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:49,199
idiot like me can you explain what

1212
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,760
triggers early means because I know it

1213
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,259
took me years to figure out what that

1214
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,440
even meant

1215
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,300
yeah so as you know after the solstice

1216
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,679
the days start to get shorter and

1217
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,519
shorter

1218
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,960
um most stuff outdoor doesn't wait until

1219
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:07,440
it's

1220
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:10,260
actual daylight equivalent to flip if it

1221
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,440
did that everything would flip in

1222
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,780
September here so um as it is as the

1223
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,519
days get shorter and shorter

1224
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,200
um you know some stuff will start

1225
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,659
flowering at

1226
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,419
14 hours of daylight some stuff will

1227
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:27,598
start flowering at 13 hours of daylight

1228
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,940
you know if you have it if you have it

1229
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,099
where it only gets Morning Sun it might

1230
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,800
trigger a little bit earlier

1231
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:36,780
um so that's always been

1232
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,359
especially with messing with different

1233
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,680
cuts outside you know there's some stuff

1234
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,199
that was

1235
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,719
amazing indoor but you take it outdoor

1236
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:48,058
and it triggers at the end of August and

1237
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:50,879
you can't finish it right here

1238
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:54,180
um Green Crack triggers pretty early

1239
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,260
um consistently so it was it was a good

1240
00:51:54,179 --> 00:52:00,598
candidate to work with for my scene

1241
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:04,079
yeah I know we liked it outdoors in San

1242
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:06,900
Diego a lot too uh mostly yeah outdoor

1243
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,940
experiences green crack and yeah Casey's

1244
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,838
brains and green crack for the most part

1245
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,519
yeah

1246
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,980
yeah

1247
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:15,599
okay yeah so that's awesome so those are

1248
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,519
some of your initial considerations when

1249
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,440
you made the cross

1250
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,358
um would you be able to take us through

1251
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,639
the Journey of like

1252
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:27,239
where appalachia's been from you know

1253
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:29,098
from the early days uh with Bodhi and to

1254
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:31,500
where it is now

1255
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:35,400
uh yeah so

1256
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,480
I gave it to dirty I didn't really know

1257
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,599
um

1258
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,519
what all had come of it I kind of took a

1259
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,260
break from

1260
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,219
um the forums

1261
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,839
the late 2000s maybe 2008 2009 I took a

1262
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:49,500
couple years off from it I was just kind

1263
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:52,500
of

1264
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,818
sick of the politics sikka you know the

1265
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,358
big Dickens

1266
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:57,838
um

1267
00:52:54,358 --> 00:53:00,719
so I I didn't really know

1268
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,358
what was going on with it I was I was

1269
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,399
growing it outside every year I had a

1270
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,739
couple cuts that I grew inside but

1271
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,000
outdoor I would usually make a few seeds

1272
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:10,219
with it

1273
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,679
um

1274
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:16,078
basically uh

1275
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,358
kind of uneducated or not uneducated it

1276
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,359
just wasn't ever something that

1277
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:23,460
I intended

1278
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:26,159
for you know a broad audience so it was

1279
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,318
one-to-one breeding I find a male I like

1280
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,118
see the lowers on a female I liked and

1281
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:30,779
keep disease

1282
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:35,099
um

1283
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:38,040
around I don't know two thousand

1284
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,539
I don't know early 2010s

1285
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:42,480
um

1286
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:44,039
Matt was actually on I see mag and sent

1287
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,079
me a message

1288
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:50,039
um saying that

1289
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,380
Ken had won the Cannabis Cup with a

1290
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:55,500
renamed appalachicut

1291
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,720
um and I I logged on just to you know

1292
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,920
answer my messages and team up with a

1293
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:03,480
few people I don't want to lose contact

1294
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:05,099
with and I saw that and you know I hit

1295
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,838
up voting about it and we talked about

1296
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:10,220
it and he's like oh man you know I

1297
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:10,219
didn't want to drag you into the drama

1298
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:20,579
filled me in on it and um you know it

1299
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,818
the word got out that it was

1300
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:28,440
um Cody's keeper female Appalachian cut

1301
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:31,440
that won the Cannabis Cup as a 11.

1302
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,280
um and around that same time

1303
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,240
um

1304
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:39,359
thought he had made you know a lot of

1305
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,159
crosses with it and uh it was it was

1306
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,679
starting to take off so

1307
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:46,199
that's when it was um you know that's

1308
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,858
when it was kind of a big deal

1309
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:50,159
um

1310
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:53,098
there was a ton of demand for it I you

1311
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,899
know I had some seeds that I was working

1312
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,559
with but not a ton

1313
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,838
um

1314
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:02,579
and

1315
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:06,480
uh I think I originally released

1316
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:11,880
the line as an F3

1317
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:15,599
around 2012 through the sea Depot

1318
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,980
um which was you know a European seed

1319
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,559
bank that

1320
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:25,760
was stand up until it wasn't yeah um

1321
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:31,460
yeah I released those and um

1322
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,460
the sour diesel Appalachian cross

1323
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,960
so at which point with the oh sorry oh

1324
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,180
no go ahead

1325
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,260
this is going to ask with the F3

1326
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:46,259
um how were you selecting towards that

1327
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,180
um so at that time I was looking for

1328
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,220
basically what I'm looking for now I

1329
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,019
like um

1330
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:56,039
green crack my favorite thing about it

1331
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:59,280
is the flavor the candied mango it's

1332
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:02,159
really good the high is nice if you let

1333
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,280
it go 70 days but if you take it when it

1334
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:08,219
looks done around eight weeks it's it's

1335
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,740
not I mean it's not that good you know

1336
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:13,259
if you take a 70. it's a nice Buzz it's

1337
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:15,358
a good all-time day smoke

1338
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,460
um but it doesn't you know

1339
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,199
it doesn't pack a punch it has a pretty

1340
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,818
low ceiling

1341
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,439
um but the flavor is I mean you just

1342
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:27,358
want to smoke it constantly yeah so

1343
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,720
um you know my goal with that one has

1344
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:33,358
always been try to get some of the mango

1345
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:37,019
flavor with the potency

1346
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,940
um which you know it's hard to get it

1347
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:42,119
all together

1348
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:44,818
um but that's that was the goal then

1349
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:49,079
um and that's you know I don't know how

1350
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:50,279
many of those tax got sold

1351
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:52,920
um

1352
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,900
I you know they shut down a few months

1353
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,480
after I started dealing with them and

1354
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,440
kind of screwed all the Breeders but

1355
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,099
yeah

1356
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,960
um

1357
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:03,539
yeah

1358
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,420
but that was that was the goal then and

1359
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:09,838
um after I you know took my lickins

1360
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:12,300
there I just kind of gave up on

1361
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,699
any kind of ideas with the seed game

1362
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:19,280
because it was too sketchy dealing with

1363
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,279
people in Europe and all that jazz

1364
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,879
yeah

1365
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,640
um

1366
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,460
is it worth talking about

1367
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:33,539
the difference between you working on it

1368
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:36,300
then and your recent releases of it

1369
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:38,579
uh sure so

1370
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,400
you know working on it then I made those

1371
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:43,500
f3s I didn't use

1372
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,160
a huge pool

1373
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,318
um

1374
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,960
to select from then

1375
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:51,779
uh the f2s

1376
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,720
you know it was from Maybe

1377
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,000
15 seeds something like that

1378
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:59,338
um and

1379
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,139
once I got to F3 there were some plants

1380
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:05,519
I liked but

1381
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:08,639
when I made F force with it it it lost

1382
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,920
the manga the mango was pretty much gone

1383
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:14,279
um you know there was a higher

1384
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,300
percentage of of lands highly resinous

1385
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,579
plants

1386
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,859
um the the resin from Green Crack came

1387
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:21,539
through but it lost the flavor

1388
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:24,179
the resident of it came through and then

1389
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:26,460
the potency of the trace off but I

1390
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:29,338
couldn't I couldn't get that flavor

1391
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:32,039
um I I took it to F5

1392
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:34,679
um see if I could

1393
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,960
you know find some but it was you know

1394
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:39,659
more of the same it was it remained a

1395
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:43,260
very vigorous highly resonance plant

1396
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:45,539
with um you know still a a good little

1397
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,920
range to it um some good highs in there

1398
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:51,358
but it it didn't have the flavor

1399
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,298
um so

1400
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,179
you know after years of

1401
00:58:54,298 --> 00:59:00,179
people asking about it and Matt kind of

1402
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:04,798
getting on me to make some more I um I

1403
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:06,539
went back to the f2s I popped 50 of them

1404
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:09,539
and um

1405
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:11,880
I found

1406
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:14,519
um you know several plants that I really

1407
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,980
liked in the f2s there were there's a

1408
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:19,980
good bit of mango there were some some

1409
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:23,099
with you know mango and fuel kind of

1410
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:26,000
interplaying and in a unique way

1411
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:31,079
um So to avoid

1412
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:34,380
bottlenecking it I I used a couple males

1413
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,420
and um you know all of my favorite

1414
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,140
females

1415
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,318
um

1416
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:42,058
I grew the females out separately smoked

1417
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,519
on them all and the ones that were

1418
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:47,460
really impressive that had what I

1419
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:50,460
thought I wanted in the line those are

1420
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,440
the ones that um I

1421
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,679
harvested seed from and that's what I

1422
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,679
released

1423
00:59:56,338 --> 01:00:00,960
um did you make a conscious decision

1424
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:03,838
about whether to do one-to-one as

1425
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,179
opposed to like a group

1426
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:08,338
uh so I

1427
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:10,440
yeah I did make that decision so

1428
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,719
initially I was doing one-to-one

1429
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,679
braiding and I think that

1430
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:18,779
works really well for certain things

1431
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:21,659
um the

1432
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,000
the thing with Appalachia at the time

1433
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:26,159
you know was some people wanted it to

1434
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,980
smoke a lot of people wanted it for

1435
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,500
hobbyist reading projects

1436
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,298
um and a lot of people had a kind of

1437
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,400
different

1438
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:39,420
um impression of what the line should be

1439
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:42,720
based on Cody's work Cody had a male

1440
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:45,298
that brought a lot of creaminess

1441
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,618
um you know like a creamy Kim

1442
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:47,338
sweetness

1443
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:50,579
um

1444
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:52,558
to the lines and I didn't want to

1445
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,359
completely deviate from that because

1446
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,000
that's what a lot of people you know

1447
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,920
fell in love with with the line

1448
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,119
um so I wanted it to keep I wanted to

1449
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,400
keep it open

1450
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,380
so that there would be

1451
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,619
um a decent variety for people to look

1452
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,619
through

1453
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,960
um

1454
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:15,059
there what I heard there basically is

1455
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,980
that the world owes me a favor for

1456
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,359
getting you to release seeds so

1457
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,298
basically it's all me is what I heard

1458
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:23,400
there yeah yeah yeah I definitely did

1459
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:25,318
want to get into two guys one cups but

1460
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,720
just before that

1461
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:29,279
on either side of the Appalachia like in

1462
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:31,379
this whole journey were there other

1463
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,760
notable projects

1464
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,760
um that you'd like to highlight

1465
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:40,079
um

1466
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,099
not really I've done a lot of kind of

1467
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,420
like

1468
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:46,260
private stuff for my own curiosity and

1469
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,599
um

1470
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,160
I don't know I have I've done a lot of

1471
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,940
things that

1472
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:55,980
I'm either not pleased with or they I've

1473
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,139
never got around to testing them I have

1474
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,818
I have a lot of crosses I've done but I

1475
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:01,318
never really had the

1476
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:02,159
the mindset

1477
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:04,318
um

1478
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,058
to release them commercially so there's

1479
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,519
I have a good amount of stuff that I'm

1480
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:11,280
kind of digging back through now

1481
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:14,159
um but no nothing noteworthy that would

1482
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,519
mean anything to anybody except me it's

1483
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:20,279
the pickiest person I've ever met it's

1484
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,199
crazy how much stuff he's made and or

1485
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,839
like I've talked about in the past like

1486
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,838
gone through several generations and

1487
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:29,759
then been like nah I'll go back like

1488
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,619
three steps and then start there again

1489
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,260
and go back through it's like

1490
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:36,780
tedious I mean it's it's amazing to

1491
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:39,900
watch sure yeah it's amazing to watch

1492
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,540
it's it's just not often done you know

1493
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:45,599
because it is

1494
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:49,798
yeah I mean it's um you know

1495
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,720
like I have a TMD back cross that I made

1496
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:53,400
um but that's not it's not something

1497
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:55,078
that's ready

1498
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,298
for any kind of

1499
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:00,298
ready for me to let out I've you know I

1500
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:03,239
recently did some more sativa kind of

1501
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:06,358
stuff but it's um you know

1502
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,679
Fury's still out on it I gotta I gotta

1503
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:09,719
approve of it

1504
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,940
I think um we can come back to some of

1505
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:14,578
your you know current more recent

1506
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,139
experiments and your b-sides uh but

1507
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:17,579
maybe we can't talk about two guys one

1508
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,440
cups

1509
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,760
at this point

1510
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,240
yeah

1511
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:27,660
um that that was all I mean it pretty

1512
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:30,239
much sent from a joke yeah when uh

1513
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:32,338
me and Matt were talking about you know

1514
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,618
winning cuffs and not getting credit for

1515
01:03:32,338 --> 01:03:37,318
it because the genetics were either

1516
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:40,200
renamed or you know just not called out

1517
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:43,318
and I was like man we need to we need to

1518
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:45,598
start a company and call it uh

1519
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:48,139
two guys one cups and I spelled it like

1520
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,140
you know the

1521
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:55,199
um

1522
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:57,719
and really it's um

1523
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,939
from a marketing and branding standpoint

1524
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:02,879
it's a terrible move

1525
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:05,460
um like probably the worst

1526
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,460
um worse things ever but it was it was

1527
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:11,519
uh it was just something we were

1528
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:14,639
[ __ ] around with for fun to release

1529
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,619
kind of collaborations

1530
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,480
um yeah we've talked we've talked about

1531
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,039
like rebranding and maybe doing it

1532
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,980
seriously

1533
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:25,558
um yeah but but there's some cool stuff

1534
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:28,679
in there bro yeah that was such a good

1535
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:31,798
name too yeah why don't people

1536
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:37,199
appreciate like triple entender

1537
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:38,880
yeah yeah it's super witty yeah so what

1538
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,639
were your uh what were both of your

1539
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:46,220
favorites to come out of that collab

1540
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:49,139
how we only did too yeah

1541
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:51,838
there's two there was the um the poodle

1542
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:54,358
nuts bloop on it and then the lupus

1543
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:56,519
headband Appalachia and that's it that's

1544
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:59,880
what we've got that that comprises the

1545
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:02,880
total of two guys one cups

1546
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,318
yeah how does Google nuts relate to dogs

1547
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,680
walls

1548
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,980
it's a cut of it it's the it's the cut

1549
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:13,440
did uh 40 grit found that was kind of

1550
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,460
how it became popular

1551
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,599
yeah

1552
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,079
yeah

1553
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,079
cool

1554
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:23,159
um but yeah that's that's the extent of

1555
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:26,880
that that work thus far

1556
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:30,739
yeah and they maybe under new different

1557
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,740
names new different messes

1558
01:05:33,298 --> 01:05:37,858
um I don't know where this one fits in

1559
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:38,880
high in Lonesome but we you and I talked

1560
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:40,380
about

1561
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,318
um you talking about breeding for

1562
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,700
recessives so where did that appear

1563
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:46,500
in your

1564
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:48,899
yeah timeline

1565
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:52,079
um so I mean that's kind of that was

1566
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,338
kind of like something I dealt with from

1567
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,980
the jump

1568
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:59,699
um in trying to

1569
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:03,179
breed a Mexican plant that didn't have

1570
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:06,298
um hermaphroditic traits I had um

1571
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:09,480
I was I was pretty I always kind of been

1572
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:10,798
a geek about all this [ __ ] so when I

1573
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,818
used to get

1574
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,519
um

1575
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:16,920
bags of Mexican weed I would save the

1576
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:19,380
seeds I would

1577
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:22,019
um label them and I had a system I made

1578
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,838
up it was pretty like over the top

1579
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:27,239
really thinking back on it but I would

1580
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:29,519
have some notes on it some notes on you

1581
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:32,338
know the quality of the high

1582
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:34,139
from the plants the physical appearance

1583
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:36,000
appearance without being too harsh

1584
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:39,179
because you know like I said that stuff

1585
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,579
was all treated like [ __ ] yeah

1586
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:43,919
and I would you know I would ask for

1587
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:45,798
origin most of the time I couldn't get

1588
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,659
it but you know sometimes it would be

1589
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:50,639
Sinaloa or oh or whatever probably just

1590
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:51,358
whatever that you thought would shut me

1591
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,519
up

1592
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:55,920
um yeah

1593
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:58,199
yeah so I

1594
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,059
but it was good because I could go back

1595
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:01,739
and look at

1596
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:04,440
um you know which ones were my favorite

1597
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:05,818
to smoke and um those would be the seeds

1598
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,579
that I bought

1599
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:10,380
um I'd also go on things like you know

1600
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:12,539
seed maturity if there were a ton of

1601
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,160
white seeds in it I figured you know

1602
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:18,079
they have problems finishing in Mexico

1603
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,078
it's pretty [ __ ] for Virginia

1604
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:25,260
but uh so I grew one of those lines and

1605
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,239
um

1606
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:29,760
it was

1607
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:32,038
you know it was a pretty traditional

1608
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,520
kind of Mexican sativa there was a lot

1609
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:37,319
of plants with

1610
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:40,139
in it but I had one plant

1611
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:43,318
um it was like a straight mango and that

1612
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:47,279
like a cantaloupe Melanie

1613
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:49,199
um you know sweet spice it was a really

1614
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,900
just incredible flavor it was the only

1615
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,058
thing I'd really seen like that

1616
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:57,599
um in Mexican weed

1617
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:59,420
um but it it was a full-on intersex

1618
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,859
plant I mean you know you'd have

1619
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:03,539
clusters in the tops you'd have clusters

1620
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:05,400
everywhere

1621
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:07,079
um so I crossed I crossed that to

1622
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:11,280
another

1623
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:14,099
um another Mexican I had and uh you know

1624
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,660
the next year I grew those out

1625
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:18,600
um they

1626
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:21,059
in the F1 there was a good mix I didn't

1627
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,420
find anything that was quite like that

1628
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:27,298
cantaloupe type plant so I made a few

1629
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,319
more with my favorite plants and then in

1630
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:31,798
the

1631
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,679
um in the F3 of that plant I found quite

1632
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:38,640
a few that had that cantaloupe Aroma to

1633
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:41,640
them but they all permed

1634
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:46,199
um so that was you know I was trying to

1635
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:48,900
breed for that recessive flavor profile

1636
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:50,698
but in that line that seemed to be

1637
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:52,920
linked to

1638
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:57,539
intersex traits

1639
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,140
um so that was that was my first

1640
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:01,198
um

1641
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,779
first experience trying to breed for

1642
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,439
recessives failing at it

1643
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,380
um

1644
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:10,798
and then you know I've had several other

1645
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,520
instances with it over the years

1646
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:13,319
um

1647
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,420
one project

1648
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,739
it's not even I mean I guess it's a

1649
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,779
project because I've been working on it

1650
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:21,059
for a few years but um

1651
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,279
I have been growing

1652
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:28,080
um

1653
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:32,640
a line from Hyde is subterfuge it's his

1654
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:36,600
um improved ABC line they say you know

1655
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,338
the plants are very ABC they're

1656
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,259
you know you can tell he's worked it

1657
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:41,939
quite a bit it's pretty inbred the

1658
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,520
plants are sluggish

1659
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:46,379
um takes a while to get them going

1660
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,660
um and I've been kind of making scenes

1661
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:50,460
with it playing with it I've made a good

1662
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:51,238
amount of hybrids with it

1663
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,880
um

1664
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:55,979
trying to

1665
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,460
get a little more potency out of it and

1666
01:09:55,979 --> 01:10:05,159
trying to get away from the serpentaline

1667
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:06,899
which is very I mean it's not it's not

1668
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,939
like um

1669
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:11,339
it's not like train wrecked or kindling

1670
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:13,678
where it has some interesting notes in

1671
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:16,860
it it's kind of like a flat kind of

1672
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:20,039
one-dimensional flavor

1673
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:23,099
um so the first time I made seats with

1674
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:26,460
that line I crossed it too

1675
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:29,520
um several things that I thought could

1676
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:32,100
Aid in the potency and the flavor uh Kim

1677
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,080
D Bubba Kush

1678
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:36,360
um

1679
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:37,079
I think TK a few others

1680
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:38,819
um

1681
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:41,698
and

1682
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:45,539
I I popped some of those hybrids

1683
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:48,719
um see Kim D ABC is the one that I've

1684
01:10:45,539 --> 01:10:51,719
kind of messed with the most so when you

1685
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:55,380
uh pop the f1s of it they're all normal

1686
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:56,880
there's not a mutant anything in there

1687
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,359
yeah um

1688
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:03,420
did you know you get some plants that

1689
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:06,599
have the kind of ABC type

1690
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:09,779
um flavor palette and Pie you know some

1691
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,100
stuff that just isn't really hitting on

1692
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:13,019
all that much

1693
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,679
um yeah but

1694
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,600
um

1695
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,960
in the f1s they're completely normal

1696
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,760
plants when you S2 them though uh when

1697
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,819
you F2 them you'll start to see that

1698
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,039
recessive Leaf pop out

1699
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:29,759
um you get a mix of them

1700
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:32,279
but to lock down that recessive trait

1701
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,659
you know you have to have to take it to

1702
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:36,539
an F3

1703
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:37,738
um and it's something I've been messing

1704
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:39,960
with it

1705
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:42,658
um I've talked to CSI about it because

1706
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,500
he's done much more work with it than I

1707
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:45,599
have

1708
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,479
um with the

1709
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,520
uh ABC line not not subject huge but

1710
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,759
same kind of thing

1711
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:57,659
um but you know once you get back to

1712
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,260
having that mutation on the leaf

1713
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:00,299
um

1714
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,000
you pretty much

1715
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:06,060
you're back where you started that's in

1716
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,619
square one yeah I mean you can get some

1717
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,980
stuff that's a little bit prettier or

1718
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:14,640
smells a little bit better or might be a

1719
01:12:10,979 --> 01:12:17,698
tad more potent but you're pretty much

1720
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,920
back in the same ball game you know once

1721
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:22,198
you get to that level so

1722
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,060
it's um

1723
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:25,500
and that's another thing you know it's a

1724
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:28,860
it's a recessive trait that you're

1725
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:31,439
trying to isolate but once you work it

1726
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:33,658
to the point of getting there

1727
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:36,960
um it seems to be linked with that kind

1728
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:40,439
of adult or penalteen low potency thing

1729
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:43,500
so yeah it's um it's taught me

1730
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:45,539
a lot that that's a good line for

1731
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,880
messing with like something like that or

1732
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:50,100
something like maybe breeding

1733
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,859
autoflowers where you can visually see

1734
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:56,400
the recessives that you're looking for

1735
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:59,339
um but it's been um it's taught me a lot

1736
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:02,399
about reading it's just uh it's just not

1737
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:05,640
easy yeah the stubborn stubborn link

1738
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:07,139
traits like that are crazy like yeah I

1739
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,699
mean do you think that's what Hyde was

1740
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:11,159
doing because I know when you go back

1741
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:13,678
and look at the um the genetics and

1742
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:16,139
makeup of subterfuge it's it's like got

1743
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,359
so much in it was it I wonder if he was

1744
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,360
just going like always moving forward

1745
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:23,698
like okay I'm gonna try to put Calio in

1746
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:25,579
it and then uh it didn't really work

1747
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:29,219
that great let's try this one

1748
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:32,640
you know or yeah

1749
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:35,640
I don't know how he did it um you know

1750
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:39,420
I've never talked to him about that

1751
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:41,340
um but I assume he probably had to do it

1752
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:44,158
kind of similar to

1753
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:46,679
what I did or what you know CSI has done

1754
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,839
where you have to take it to an F3 just

1755
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:49,859
to get back to that mutation

1756
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,860
um yeah

1757
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:55,859
so you would really

1758
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:58,979
I feel like you would need to just

1759
01:13:55,859 --> 01:14:01,380
inbreed it to the point of it not being

1760
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:04,619
fun to grow to get anything else out of

1761
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:08,460
it yeah we we actually have an Aussie

1762
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:11,340
guy who is in our Discord a new member

1763
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:13,319
um and I believe he worked sort of

1764
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:15,179
collaborated with Caleb or was growing a

1765
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,219
bunch of ABC in Australia talking to

1766
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:19,560
Caleb about it so maybe he'll have

1767
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:20,520
interesting questions to follow up with

1768
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,800
um

1769
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,360
I think uh yeah really cool to hear an

1770
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,679
account of

1771
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,658
um

1772
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,760
actively looking for these recessives

1773
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:31,679
actually seeing like the ratios come out

1774
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,480
in f2s

1775
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,020
um yeah there must have been a pretty

1776
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:38,639
amazing experience

1777
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:42,060
ABC was its own like

1778
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,520
wild rare cannabis hunt for a lot of us

1779
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:46,980
that were like straight up dorks I think

1780
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,780
like not everyone even knew about it

1781
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:51,359
like it was this kind of like Niche

1782
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:52,979
thing that like in the even in the

1783
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:54,719
breeding Community it was still Niche

1784
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:57,059
for anybody to even note that this thing

1785
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,219
[ __ ] existed and nobody could get

1786
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:02,100
their [ __ ] mitts on it in the US and

1787
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:05,399
you know there's the emery release of

1788
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:08,159
like that and slow crossed and yeah yeah

1789
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:10,979
I had some of those did you

1790
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:13,859
yeah but I when I got them

1791
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:16,919
I didn't want to pop them until I you

1792
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:19,319
know yeah I I don't know what it was I

1793
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,699
was saving saving them hoping you know I

1794
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,219
could do some reading with it or

1795
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:25,019
something and I didn't know for the

1796
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:27,658
night you you lose your virginity and

1797
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:32,000
then you can pop up yeah exactly exactly

1798
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:32,000
um yeah but that never happens so um

1799
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,279
they just gotta uh yeah I've let them

1800
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:40,699
age out and I couldn't pop them when I

1801
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:40,698
went to them

1802
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:47,158
I can't remember how many packs were

1803
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:49,500
released to that but it was so limited

1804
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:51,839
yeah yeah it was um but that's what

1805
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:55,859
that's what uh odds line was based off

1806
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,900
of yeah that Emery drop

1807
01:15:55,859 --> 01:16:00,658
that's right

1808
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:03,599
but yeah someone finally I you our

1809
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:07,559
friend resin lung even went to Australia

1810
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,579
to try to go track down ABC like on his

1811
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,920
own

1812
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:14,760
and you couldn't do it and then

1813
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:18,359
eventually eventually one dude like

1814
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,920
still kind of I personally my opinion is

1815
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:21,238
it's kind of sketch how he came across

1816
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,539
them I'm still thinking that they might

1817
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:26,519
just be by a hype somehow like

1818
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:28,560
backdoored maybe

1819
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,620
um but yeah somehow they were brought to

1820
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,380
Market eventually and uh

1821
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:36,059
I'm glad they did though yeah

1822
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:38,359
yeah it's definitely

1823
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:40,739
um something more for like the hardcore

1824
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:45,479
nerds than the people that are like

1825
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:49,559
trying to grow smokable flowers to sell

1826
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:51,479
um because it has zero marketability I

1827
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,719
think but um I mean it just looks like

1828
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:56,879
Ivy it looks like Ivy yeah yeah they're

1829
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,219
they're super cool plants

1830
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,619
yeah I have a bunch of your your version

1831
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:03,420
of the subterfuge going on right now

1832
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:06,119
yeah yeah

1833
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,658
I have facts of it that I still haven't

1834
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:08,658
shopped

1835
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,920
but man okay yeah

1836
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:16,679
I think it's cool I wish everybody grew

1837
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,380
up even for ornamental it's uh oh yeah

1838
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:21,600
yeah I mean guys

1839
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,579
yeah you could grow a yard full of it

1840
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,020
nobody know what the [ __ ] it is that's

1841
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:26,819
for sure

1842
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,280
yeah

1843
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:33,599
okay well I thought we could maybe wrap

1844
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:35,399
up this bit on recessives and we have so

1845
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,659
many questions for you um but I think

1846
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:38,579
before we get on to some of the more

1847
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:40,439
open-ended ones

1848
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:41,579
um I'd love for you to kind of

1849
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:45,719
um

1850
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:47,600
I suppose not conclude but um we can we

1851
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:50,880
can focus a bit more on your work again

1852
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,739
and maybe you can talk through some of

1853
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,539
the recent releases

1854
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:56,759
um the Appalachia crosses

1855
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:58,439
that you've made uh maybe standouts

1856
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,600
anything interesting in in the process

1857
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:04,979
of making those

1858
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:07,800
uh yeah so those were all you know

1859
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:10,019
it I didn't cross everything I have in

1860
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,060
my stable to it I mean that's kind of

1861
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:15,540
that's kind of the move but there was

1862
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:18,120
you know it was all plants uh that I

1863
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:20,698
felt could benefit from certain aspects

1864
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:23,698
of it um you know

1865
01:18:20,698 --> 01:18:26,099
old Betsy is one of my

1866
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:27,719
favorite things to smoke the flavor is

1867
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:30,480
incredible

1868
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:32,640
um it's just it's it's like opening a

1869
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,619
jar of Grandma's jelly I mean it's just

1870
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,239
you can't stop smelling it it's just

1871
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:37,859
incredible

1872
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:40,439
um every time I open a jar I'm like well

1873
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:42,779
[ __ ] let me just smoke a little um but

1874
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:44,759
it you know when you're vegging the

1875
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:47,759
plant it always wants to throw pistols

1876
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:49,920
if you get it root down if you get a

1877
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,460
root found it wants to start flowering

1878
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,619
if you feed it the wrong thing it wants

1879
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:56,880
to start flowering it's a it's kind of a

1880
01:18:55,619 --> 01:18:59,219
visual plant

1881
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,619
um so I wanted to

1882
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:04,079
cross it to something

1883
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:06,599
so that I could kind of I wanted

1884
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:08,698
something similar that I could kind of

1885
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,679
you know go back and pull that pull that

1886
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:12,839
type of plant out with

1887
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:15,600
um that was

1888
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:17,699
that was a pretty successful one I think

1889
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,420
I I really like the way that that came

1890
01:19:17,698 --> 01:19:20,519
out

1891
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,800
um

1892
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,900
yeah can I ask you could you use that

1893
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,840
trigger that that

1894
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:30,859
that pre-flowering trait as a beneficial

1895
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,860
thing for outdoor

1896
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:37,020
um outdoor it doesn't seem to do it the

1897
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:38,698
way that I grow

1898
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:42,719
so

1899
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:43,319
in full sun it it's a little bit more

1900
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,899
um

1901
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:48,719
it's a little bit more vigorous in the

1902
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:52,559
Sun and I normally grow in

1903
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:54,779
pretty large pots so yeah uh it doesn't

1904
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,400
have that issue where like if it hits

1905
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:59,158
you know if it hits the side of the pot

1906
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,379
it gets pissed yeah um

1907
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:02,759
okay that makes a lot more sense yeah

1908
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:05,579
yeah

1909
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,159
okay continue sorry

1910
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:09,840
um but I did that one

1911
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:15,000
um the shoreline is

1912
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:17,279
one of my favorites I smoke it daily

1913
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,179
um it's an incredible plant it is an

1914
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:24,179
absolute Beast outside for my climate of

1915
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:29,219
all the cuts that I've grown outside it

1916
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:32,579
uh performs the best uh yield wise it is

1917
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:34,920
very rot resistant you can take it

1918
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:36,960
through some [ __ ] in the fall and it's

1919
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:39,179
um it comes out fine when everything

1920
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,698
else is kind of melting away it's just

1921
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:44,819
standing there rocking

1922
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:46,879
um so that's that's one I did

1923
01:20:44,819 --> 01:20:46,880
um

1924
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,199
maybe you can ask I can ask the First

1925
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:54,420
Community question

1926
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:56,819
um we're just from two groups

1927
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,779
um and I imagine from Kristen as well in

1928
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,238
spirit

1929
01:20:57,779 --> 01:21:02,279
um they want to know what the shoreline

1930
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:03,899
what you've observed the shoreline tends

1931
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:07,439
to pass

1932
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:09,658
okay uh so the shoreline

1933
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:13,439
it comes through pretty

1934
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:17,819
pretty strong in crosses for the the

1935
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:20,579
Terps the it has this on any Funk trash

1936
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:22,319
kind of just nastiness

1937
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:25,140
um it's super loud

1938
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:27,238
um you know it's when it's flowering you

1939
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:29,760
know you got some Shoreline in there um

1940
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:34,139
it it comes through really well for that

1941
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:37,020
and it it throws these fat colas you

1942
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:40,800
know it's in Veg it's not super vigorous

1943
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:45,380
but once you flip it it it just beasts

1944
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:48,960
out and um you know of the

1945
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:51,300
Appalachian crosses that's probably the

1946
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,859
that and the the GMO cross are the best

1947
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:55,560
yielding

1948
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:57,960
um but it's it's uh it's just a

1949
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,820
phenomenal plant and it passes the

1950
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,219
things that I like

1951
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:05,099
um but you know the Apple actually gives

1952
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:06,539
it a little bit a little bit more Vigor

1953
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,940
in veg

1954
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:10,500
um it it's easier to get up

1955
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,799
going

1956
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,579
but yeah the funk the Short Line Funk is

1957
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,940
what

1958
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:21,019
what I what I wanted to pass and luckily

1959
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:21,019
what it does yes

1960
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:27,259
we'll be happy

1961
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,260
yeah I'm interested

1962
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:33,599
uh that's a a cool one so you know GMO

1963
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:36,119
is

1964
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,560
is pretty well known for dominating

1965
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,198
crosses

1966
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,340
um it dominates a lot of things

1967
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:44,460
um

1968
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:47,940
with Appalachia it

1969
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:50,279
it still comes through really strong

1970
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:53,339
um you know if you want

1971
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:55,198
a close representation of GMO

1972
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,760
you should pop them because you'll get

1973
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,939
you'll get some that are kind of dead

1974
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:02,640
ringers for it you also get some yeah

1975
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:06,238
you also get some that have that same

1976
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:09,659
kind of resin production and that same

1977
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:11,099
um that same kind of dumping ability of

1978
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:14,819
GMOs that have a little bit more

1979
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:16,679
tropical flavor to them they still still

1980
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:18,779
have a ton of stretch

1981
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:21,840
um but they have a lot of fuel on the

1982
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:23,519
back end so that that's a good cross and

1983
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,840
if you're looking for something that's a

1984
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,560
little more

1985
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,560
um

1986
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,260
you know modern kind of weed like I

1987
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,860
don't like most modern things I try I

1988
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:37,320
don't like gelatos at all I I'm not a

1989
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:40,380
big fan of any cookies any kind of cakes

1990
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:41,099
I've tried a ton of that stuff and you

1991
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:44,039
know

1992
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,739
I like to grow weeds it gets me high and

1993
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:47,640
that stuff just doesn't do its one

1994
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:49,678
um

1995
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,560
GMO is

1996
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:55,560
I think probably the most remarkable

1997
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,260
plant that's come out of that of the

1998
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,400
most you know recent eras of things and

1999
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:02,219
um

2000
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:03,359
it's a it's an incredible plant and I

2001
01:24:02,219 --> 01:24:05,880
just wanted

2002
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,819
um you know I wanted something that

2003
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,859
people could could find GMO but maybe

2004
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:14,698
have a little more variability than a

2005
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:17,519
lot of the you know GMA work out there

2006
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:19,738
yeah very killer

2007
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:24,320
um definitely the one that interests me

2008
01:24:19,738 --> 01:24:28,139
and uh is the Electric Boogaloo cross

2009
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:29,759
yep yeah so that that was a bit of a

2010
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:32,340
beast

2011
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,679
um you know locals has a really good

2012
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,400
kind of mix of Phoenix going right now I

2013
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:38,219
have

2014
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,899
one outdoor that is

2015
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:42,658
um massive

2016
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:45,119
um it's hasn't started to flower yet and

2017
01:24:42,658 --> 01:24:46,920
uh it's yeah like I don't know eight

2018
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:51,059
feet tall it's a giant

2019
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,500
um but there there is um you know I

2020
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:55,560
tried reversing

2021
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:58,500
Electric Boogaloo several times and it

2022
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:02,219
just didn't it didn't produce pollen

2023
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:04,380
um but I was I it has some really

2024
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:06,658
interesting stuff in there there are

2025
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:09,060
some plants in there that look

2026
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:12,420
like Neville's haze there are some

2027
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,380
plants in there that yeah there's some

2028
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:15,840
you know

2029
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:18,179
sensitive Expressions that have a ton of

2030
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:21,600
the kind of candied mango that I

2031
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:26,340
associate with green crack you know um

2032
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:29,579
Electric Boogaloo has has mango but

2033
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,679
more so like mid flowering like you know

2034
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:33,779
if you take it if you take it to the end

2035
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,899
that kind of dissipates and you have a

2036
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:39,599
you know a spicy just I mean it's an

2037
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:41,519
amazing finished flower but

2038
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,679
um I wanted to see if you know that

2039
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,300
cross could maybe bring out a little

2040
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,219
more of that into the finished flower

2041
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,860
and it does

2042
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:52,859
um make sense so there's there's a

2043
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:55,380
there's a pretty wide um you know

2044
01:25:52,859 --> 01:25:58,019
there's a there's a wide mix in that one

2045
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:00,600
but a lot of a lot of fatigue

2046
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:03,719
Expressions you get a few with nice

2047
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,980
running colas and um you know

2048
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:07,079
I'm a

2049
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:09,899
huge fan of

2050
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:12,840
sativas I mean that's I love them that

2051
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:14,519
and dog [ __ ] electrical glue that's one

2052
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,079
I smoke every single day and it's a lot

2053
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,739
of run out like I just did

2054
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,579
um

2055
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:22,500
but yeah that's that's a great one I

2056
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:24,779
wonder if it's like uh like a lot of us

2057
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,260
that grew up on Mexican stuff just have

2058
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:30,658
this long lasting love for for highs

2059
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:32,400
like that I don't know I like I I have a

2060
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:36,119
love for for all those type of plants

2061
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:40,019
myself very much yeah it's um well it's

2062
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:44,819
but it's I think a little bit more

2063
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:45,420
palatable to a broader audience because

2064
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:48,119
um

2065
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:50,639
like you know hazes or Mexicans or

2066
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:51,779
Colombians they can they can get you

2067
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:55,380
like

2068
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:57,840
paranoid and disoriented you can get uh

2069
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:59,279
you know just so ripped that you're you

2070
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,020
know confused disoriented it's almost

2071
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:01,939
like you know tripping

2072
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:07,020
um yeah

2073
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:10,500
but but uh golf [ __ ] is just it's a it's

2074
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:12,900
a high but it's it's gentle it's a great

2075
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:16,920
flavor and you're just soaring it's just

2076
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:18,599
you know it's like a memory of the first

2077
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:20,039
you know one of the first times you got

2078
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,139
really high and you're like riding your

2079
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:25,260
bike around that's just a beautiful

2080
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:27,539
childhood Bliss kind of high I love it

2081
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,179
yeah that's one of the ones that I I

2082
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:32,158
realized at our get-together that we had

2083
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:33,840
last time there wasn't anybody in the

2084
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:36,899
room that didn't like absolutely love

2085
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,880
that like you know greens or disagreed

2086
01:27:36,899 --> 01:27:40,019
on different things except for dog [ __ ]

2087
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,460
for some reason was the one that

2088
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:44,880
everybody

2089
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:47,158
yeah yeah I mean from the first time I

2090
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,420
smoked it I've I've just loved that one

2091
01:27:47,158 --> 01:27:50,460
that's one of my

2092
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:54,060
all-time favorites

2093
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:56,219
by the way your KMD was fire fire fire

2094
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,960
so one of my favorite growth of candies

2095
01:27:56,219 --> 01:28:01,859
ever

2096
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:04,139
uh sometimes I get it right yeah I bet

2097
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:06,779
yeah yeah

2098
01:28:04,139 --> 01:28:09,600
was there anything else you wanted to

2099
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:11,039
add uh about this your recent release

2100
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,480
because otherwise it was going to move

2101
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,060
us on to

2102
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:16,799
you maybe give us a sneak preview of

2103
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:19,020
what you're doing now or what's coming

2104
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,520
yeah the only other one I'll mention

2105
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:23,280
just because I have a lot of people ask

2106
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:27,060
about it a lot a lot of people ask me

2107
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:31,259
what the most fully line that I have is

2108
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:33,060
and um you know the the Gorilla Glue

2109
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:35,159
cross

2110
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,840
um I just harvested a couple of those

2111
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:37,920
and that is

2112
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:42,719
just

2113
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:44,940
that rank fuel it has some sweetness

2114
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:48,800
come through but it's more of like a

2115
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:51,059
like pg4 to me has like a artificial

2116
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:55,440
chocolatyness to it

2117
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:59,280
um and this has like fuel with like a

2118
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:01,339
a like powdered cocoa milk chocolatey

2119
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,359
thing on the back end it's just

2120
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:07,079
intoxicating to me

2121
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:08,759
um it's really really nice and um you

2122
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:12,000
know that's one

2123
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:14,039
where I haven't done a lot of reading

2124
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,960
with gg4 and I wasn't

2125
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:17,819
you know I wasn't sure on it but man

2126
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,439
that was one that really surprised me

2127
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:22,619
when I wrote them out

2128
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:24,059
um it's there's some phenomenal plants

2129
01:29:22,619 --> 01:29:26,219
in there

2130
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:28,219
I think a lot of us that like have tried

2131
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:31,020
to avoid using a lot of hike clones

2132
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:33,239
waited a long time to use gg4 because it

2133
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,800
was so heavily pushed like maybe even

2134
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:36,779
prior to the cookies there was just so

2135
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,840
stuffed in your face like you need to be

2136
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:41,340
growing gg4 so I didn't yeah I'm

2137
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,600
interested in it it looked like a

2138
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,219
polyhybrid to me and I figured okay

2139
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,719
that's going to breed so variant that

2140
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:48,840
why would I

2141
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:54,319
even care yeah but it breeds

2142
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:54,319
yeah it's remarkably consistent it is

2143
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:59,819
yeah for being like a poly hybrid bag

2144
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:02,100
seat I mean it is it is

2145
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:04,799
I grew you know half of the plants could

2146
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:08,639
have been cuts of the same plant that I

2147
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,719
grew it was yeah it has I think the

2148
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:13,319
least

2149
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:16,198
least Variety in any of my lines yeah I

2150
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:18,238
I was one of the last to grow that cut

2151
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:19,500
like because I it was like I said I just

2152
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:20,638
didn't want anything to do with it just

2153
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,380
because of how many other people were

2154
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,699
using it and I I just thought I'd do

2155
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,260
something different

2156
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:27,238
but when I finally did it I was like oh

2157
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,219
damn this is actually pretty good I like

2158
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:31,678
how this braids too it's actually good

2159
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:33,840
to smoke on its own too and I know CSI

2160
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,639
had that same sentiment like he hit me

2161
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,800
up he's like damn this

2162
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:40,199
why didn't anybody tell us

2163
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:42,659
yeah it's it's a good one

2164
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:45,779
um yeah it does really well outside here

2165
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:48,000
too so it kind of sticks around for that

2166
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:49,139
um and that's kind of why I kept it

2167
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,139
around

2168
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:54,659
um but I've been uh I've been pretty

2169
01:30:52,139 --> 01:30:56,400
surprised with the way it reads

2170
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:58,198
me I'm glad you guys mentioned it

2171
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,579
because yeah I was going to point out

2172
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:00,899
that

2173
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,300
um I didn't see many of you working with

2174
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:05,460
it until relatively recently I thought

2175
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,079
that was interesting

2176
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:09,658
um yeah Matt Elite turned me onto that

2177
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:11,939
one yeah he said I had to train I'm like

2178
01:31:09,658 --> 01:31:13,559
really I don't know I mean I like Josie

2179
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:16,198
a lot he's a cool dude and we got along

2180
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:17,400
and and uh and then I started smoking

2181
01:31:16,198 --> 01:31:19,019
everybody's grocery I was like God damn

2182
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:20,759
it's actually kind of good but will it

2183
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:23,219
breed like this more importantly than

2184
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,619
anything like it not only is it a good

2185
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:27,719
girl or it breeds very well true to

2186
01:31:25,619 --> 01:31:29,819
tight kind of you know yep

2187
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:32,520
yeah oh yeah

2188
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:35,880
okay so I'm I gotta plug the fact that

2189
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:38,280
uh these these seats these packs are

2190
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:41,520
available on riotsseeds.com yes

2191
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:44,460
available go there check it out and um

2192
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,920
yeah so I thought maybe now to to to

2193
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:49,139
more or less wrap up a bit on your work

2194
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,940
in this like linear fashion

2195
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:53,219
um would you be able to give us an idea

2196
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:55,439
of like what you're looking towards now

2197
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:57,420
and in and for the future

2198
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,919
um we had a question from moonbeard

2199
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,600
about

2200
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,420
um Haze experiments I think that he's

2201
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:06,659
heard of that you're you might be doing

2202
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:07,980
um uh yeah yeah so I have that going

2203
01:32:06,658 --> 01:32:11,219
um

2204
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:12,539
I actually have a few things before that

2205
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:15,840
like I have

2206
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:17,460
seeds done for a few other projects one

2207
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,619
of them is um

2208
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:22,819
I

2209
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:26,039
I was selecting a

2210
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:29,219
Appalachia out of the S3

2211
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:31,500
um looking for a candidate to do a green

2212
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:33,020
crack that cross with

2213
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:37,198
um

2214
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:41,760
I had some hiccups with you know the

2215
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:46,799
sourcing of the cut so I had to get it

2216
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:50,340
I um I had to get it from another source

2217
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,840
uh for po political reasons

2218
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,699
um so I

2219
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,719
have that

2220
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:58,079
um

2221
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,819
have that cross the seats finishing up

2222
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:03,539
now for the back cross

2223
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:06,539
um and I have already harvested

2224
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:08,279
um I wanted to remake that Appalachian

2225
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:13,639
diesel that

2226
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:18,599
um I did a few years ago so I seeded a

2227
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:20,119
pretty large saudisa Plant and I seeded

2228
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,000
um

2229
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:27,779
the headband cut that you know goes by

2230
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,439
L.A Kush from that's a dog

2231
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:33,960
um that's that's another

2232
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,678
very nice diesel

2233
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,319
um

2234
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:40,560
I really love that plant

2235
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:43,198
um indoor outdoor it has

2236
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:45,300
extreme potency it's a great plant

2237
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:49,738
um so I seeded that

2238
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:50,460
um a few other things I crossed it to my

2239
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:51,238
favorite

2240
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:55,380
um

2241
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:59,459
Santa Cruz Rec plant from Top

2242
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:01,739
um pack uh Santa Cruz good form

2243
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:04,619
um I had a

2244
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:07,619
plant that was just a beast in there it

2245
01:34:04,619 --> 01:34:08,819
um was very kind of train wreck dominant

2246
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:10,439
plant

2247
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:15,719
um but in the last few weeks of flower

2248
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:19,019
it had this really nice spicy blue

2249
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:21,600
Essence kind of come through just a

2250
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:24,659
really really nice hybrid of uh the

2251
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,880
Santa Cruz blue dream and train wreck

2252
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:29,399
um so I seeded that plant with those I'm

2253
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,179
actually just popped some of this to try

2254
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:32,638
out

2255
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:35,880
um and then I have the

2256
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:37,319
Green Crack fully pollinated

2257
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,480
um and those you know those would be

2258
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:41,639
ready to test here shortly

2259
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:43,439
that's awesome

2260
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:47,579
yeah and then

2261
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:49,259
um then I had another uh smaller run of

2262
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:50,460
some

2263
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:54,179
um

2264
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:55,020
Kim D Appalachian stuff I was messing

2265
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:58,560
with

2266
01:34:55,020 --> 01:35:01,620
um f2ing it back Crossing into victimsy

2267
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,620
um just doing a few things there

2268
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:06,300
um kind of filled in Block work nothing

2269
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:08,039
um that's that's probably just going to

2270
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,900
be stuff I mess with

2271
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:14,639
um but right now

2272
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:16,859
I'm I am doing like a haze hybrid hunt I

2273
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:20,579
uh I popped

2274
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:22,979
Super Silver Haze I have pops Northern

2275
01:35:20,579 --> 01:35:27,359
Lights five Haze

2276
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:30,599
um mango Haze that came Theo

2277
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:34,079
um Wally duck it's mango Haze IBL line

2278
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,280
that he's he's been bred in Australia

2279
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:38,460
um it's

2280
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:41,579
um yeah and then a Neville's Haze mango

2281
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:44,760
Haze uh also from Wally duck

2282
01:35:41,579 --> 01:35:45,359
um and of all those lines

2283
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,119
um

2284
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:49,799
I've grown them out and I have my

2285
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:53,639
favorites

2286
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:57,239
um the mango Haze I think is the the one

2287
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:57,840
um yeah the CL the plants are

2288
01:35:57,238 --> 01:35:59,819
um

2289
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,460
a little bit

2290
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:05,399
a little bit more finicky it's um

2291
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:08,158
you know it's not as easy a plant to

2292
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:10,619
grow as super silver haze

2293
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:11,879
um but it super silver haze tends to be

2294
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:15,119
pretty

2295
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,380
pretty much a sort of tunneline Dom

2296
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:18,779
plant

2297
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:20,279
um has a ton of that with the mango Haze

2298
01:36:18,779 --> 01:36:21,779
you get it you get some sweeter

2299
01:36:20,279 --> 01:36:23,519
spiciness

2300
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:25,319
um high is

2301
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,760
consistently

2302
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:28,619
better

2303
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:32,039
um I think it's a better representation

2304
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:33,000
of what people want in a sativa type

2305
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:34,500
High

2306
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,300
um

2307
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,000
not as muddled you know super silver

2308
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:41,579
haze you can feel the Indica influence

2309
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,279
um it's more of a hybrid

2310
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:47,760
um but but the mango Haze

2311
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:50,880
um that's my favorite I found

2312
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,539
a male that I really like in there

2313
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,699
um

2314
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:56,399
I'm going to be

2315
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:59,399
uh you know making some more of those

2316
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:01,019
seeds as my personal thing you know

2317
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:02,399
that's something while he's working with

2318
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:07,500
so

2319
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:09,719
um but I'm I'm crossing that to a lot of

2320
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,039
cuts that I have plants that I have that

2321
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:11,760
I really like

2322
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:14,579
um

2323
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,480
so that will start calling you Virginia

2324
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:19,920
mango bro I know I know I was just

2325
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,319
thinking about it I was like dude I need

2326
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:24,300
to get the [ __ ] away from mango but it's

2327
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:26,219
like you know blue I just kept going to

2328
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:27,900
it and it's just you know yeah you find

2329
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:28,739
it something you love and that just is

2330
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:31,979
it

2331
01:37:28,738 --> 01:37:35,099
well and mango Haze is is way different

2332
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:38,039
than like a candied mango crackers you

2333
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:40,800
know sure it's um you know I don't know

2334
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:42,539
if I was naming it if I call it mango

2335
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,060
Haze but you know that was the name of

2336
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:47,939
the mother was mango so

2337
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:50,639
um but yeah I'll be I'll I'll be doing a

2338
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:52,919
bunch of uh a bunch of hybrids with that

2339
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,779
um hitting it to

2340
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:57,179
um a bunch of the sativa cuts that I

2341
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:59,219
have some of the

2342
01:37:57,179 --> 01:38:01,619
heavier hitters you know the chem dogs

2343
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:04,260
and all that but um yeah there's a few

2344
01:38:01,619 --> 01:38:07,738
that I'm I'm really interested to check

2345
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:10,079
out I'm gonna hit the the A5 Haze with

2346
01:38:07,738 --> 01:38:11,339
it yeah

2347
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:13,800
so

2348
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:15,840
yeah we'll see we'll see how that goes

2349
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,460
I'm hoping everybody's not too scared to

2350
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,260
release those seed mines because uh

2351
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:21,779
let's say I checked no one else gives a

2352
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:24,659
[ __ ] you know like

2353
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:25,619
I I yeah friends sit on them and I'm

2354
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:27,839
like what the [ __ ] are you doing

2355
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:31,800
everybody else is releasing them like

2356
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:35,279
you don't have to check yeah it's um

2357
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:37,199
yeah it's um you know they're political

2358
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:39,899
issues there I

2359
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:43,138
I don't I was wasn't told anything about

2360
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:46,319
it when I got it um it's you know

2361
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:50,340
there are reasons not to release it A5

2362
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:53,819
is is one of them most difficult plants

2363
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:56,279
that I have it's um it's not easy to

2364
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:58,139
grow it's yeah it's you know it's just

2365
01:38:56,279 --> 01:38:59,460
not and most people that are used to

2366
01:38:58,139 --> 01:39:02,100
growing

2367
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,260
you know OG kush's salaries well as you

2368
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:07,139
know that modern kind of it's just a

2369
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:09,719
whole whole [ __ ] different ball game

2370
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:10,800
and um yeah it's it's a fussy little

2371
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:13,380
plant

2372
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,960
so you know

2373
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:18,960
and you know I think a lot of those

2374
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:22,139
hybrids that's going to be more kind of

2375
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,198
it's not a beginner Grower's plant

2376
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:26,639
um so yeah we'll see how it goes I'm

2377
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:28,919
looking forward to testing them out and

2378
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:31,859
that's something that

2379
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:34,380
um you know it I'm passionate about that

2380
01:39:31,859 --> 01:39:35,579
that type of smoke so it's uh I'm

2381
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,000
looking forward to

2382
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:40,979
actually getting to test them yeah

2383
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,079
we need more of that in our community as

2384
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:46,198
is like more of those type of highs

2385
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:48,119
those offerings it's gonna get it's

2386
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:50,039
gonna get more and more sparse as time

2387
01:39:48,119 --> 01:39:52,139
goes on because financially it's harder

2388
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:53,880
to produce things like that so hopefully

2389
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:56,279
people um

2390
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:59,000
take advantage of it while it's here you

2391
01:39:56,279 --> 01:39:59,000
know while it's around

2392
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:05,939
yeah you know the the commercial

2393
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:09,060
viability of something when breeding is

2394
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:12,599
never kind of been what I go for

2395
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:13,739
um I'm not great at that side of it I'm

2396
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:17,460
basically

2397
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:20,879
make things that I want to see I like to

2398
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:23,340
I like to grow the best flower that I

2399
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,199
can that's what I want to have locked

2400
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,279
down in seed form

2401
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:30,419
um so

2402
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:32,460
I'm not concerned about you know how how

2403
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,420
well it does it's just something that I

2404
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,420
feel compelled to do

2405
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:43,019
I want to say that um at this point of

2406
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,880
the conversation I'm so stoked like the

2407
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,880
archivist in me is so pleased to have

2408
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:50,039
gotten all of that information from you

2409
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,719
oh yeah yeah really grateful for that

2410
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:53,279
and

2411
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:55,859
um at this point you know was there

2412
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:58,859
anything more you want to say about

2413
01:40:55,859 --> 01:41:00,479
um your work your career so far

2414
01:40:58,859 --> 01:41:01,738
um because otherwise we can also launch

2415
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,319
into

2416
01:41:01,738 --> 01:41:06,658
the Heap of questions that we've gotten

2417
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:09,479
from both Matt and the community

2418
01:41:06,658 --> 01:41:11,339
uh no I think I'm good

2419
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:12,959
Matt did you want to kick us off on some

2420
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,279
of these more like open-ended questions

2421
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,739
I know we even have some like

2422
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:18,059
hypothetical breeding projects yeah I

2423
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:19,859
don't I don't know if I'll cover some of

2424
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:21,659
the hypotheticals because we're so far

2425
01:41:19,859 --> 01:41:25,380
in and I know we have a ton of questions

2426
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:27,479
so let's um you know one of the

2427
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:29,159
questions I had for you and it's kind of

2428
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:31,439
a hard one because I I thought of

2429
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:34,618
something that would be hard for me to

2430
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:38,539
answer what's something you about the

2431
01:41:34,618 --> 01:41:38,539
modern seed era that you enjoy

2432
01:41:38,729 --> 01:41:41,698
[Music]

2433
01:41:40,198 --> 01:41:44,519
um

2434
01:41:41,698 --> 01:41:47,219
I like how

2435
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:48,420
I I like how accessible it is for people

2436
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:49,100
I've always

2437
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:52,618
um

2438
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:55,079
I've always been a tinkerer in in the

2439
01:41:52,618 --> 01:41:57,479
weed world you know it's um it's always

2440
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:59,698
been a passion thing for me more than

2441
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:02,459
monetary

2442
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:04,738
um it's I like how accessible it is how

2443
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:07,380
how so many different people are doing

2444
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:10,019
different things uh

2445
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:11,940
it's not you know a lot of the releases

2446
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,020
you see and I'm not gonna name it it's

2447
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:15,000
because I don't wanna

2448
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:17,699
crash anybody on it but it's just the

2449
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,359
same [ __ ] across to the same [ __ ]

2450
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:22,559
um which drives me crazy and you know

2451
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:24,960
I'm

2452
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:27,780
I can say that I'm guilty of it you know

2453
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:29,939
I've made a GMO cross I've

2454
01:42:27,779 --> 01:42:32,039
um you know I've crossed salaries all

2455
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:34,439
the stuff but you know a lot of the kind

2456
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:38,460
of incestuous lines across together the

2457
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:40,439
cookies cookies and the yeah you know

2458
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:43,560
um that's that's disheartening but I

2459
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:46,198
like I like seeing the unique things

2460
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:48,539
that people are doing and

2461
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:51,419
um I like seeing people do it

2462
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:54,658
on a level that

2463
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:58,560
you know is satisfying to them

2464
01:42:54,658 --> 01:43:02,339
and less driven for you know having a

2465
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,139
drop that sells out in 30 minutes yeah

2466
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:06,420
um that's a good answer so

2467
01:43:04,139 --> 01:43:09,118
yeah you know like

2468
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:11,340
CSI you know I've I've had a ton of

2469
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:14,639
respect for him for a long time and

2470
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:15,960
he does his passion projects and you

2471
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,600
know they don't

2472
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,639
pay the bills I'm sure but that's the

2473
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,840
kind of [ __ ] when I sneak order into and

2474
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:25,679
that's what I get

2475
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:28,020
yeah right you know I want to see I want

2476
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:30,420
to see what the you know

2477
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:33,000
TK cross the

2478
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:34,020
pck is or you know whatever whatever it

2479
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,719
is

2480
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:38,040
um I wanna you know I like I like

2481
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:41,520
exploring

2482
01:43:38,039 --> 01:43:44,880
different profiles I don't want you know

2483
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:46,560
something that dumps that I can

2484
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,819
sell a bunch of horizon off of or

2485
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:54,539
something you know I like the

2486
01:43:50,819 --> 01:43:56,399
I just like the overall abundance that's

2487
01:43:54,539 --> 01:43:59,219
out there you know it's very different

2488
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:03,059
than the Dutch the Dutch era

2489
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:05,460
and that early hype kind of era

2490
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:06,960
um so yeah to me you're talking a bit

2491
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:08,939
more about now you're a breeding

2492
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:11,579
philosophy or kind of your philosophy

2493
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:13,500
towards cannabis in general like do you

2494
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:15,960
do you think it's it's evolved or

2495
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:19,520
changed much since those like

2496
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,520
uh brick weed seeds

2497
01:44:19,979 --> 01:44:26,638
um not really for me I'm kind of

2498
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:28,500
you know my number one goal is still to

2499
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,359
have the best

2500
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,618
that I can have

2501
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:34,198
um you know

2502
01:44:31,618 --> 01:44:35,880
weed early on I learned that I could

2503
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:37,919
produce something better than I could

2504
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:40,618
get and

2505
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:43,020
um you know there's there's not a lot of

2506
01:44:40,618 --> 01:44:46,519
things in life that I can have the best

2507
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:46,520
of but I can have the best sweet

2508
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:52,259
that's still

2509
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:54,658
it's still like my number one goal and

2510
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:56,100
what I kind of what I'm constantly going

2511
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:58,079
for

2512
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:00,539
yeah

2513
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:02,279
yeah love that

2514
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:05,340
all right do you want to bring in some

2515
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:07,198
of the uh the user questions

2516
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:09,360
all right all right I got I got a good

2517
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:11,638
one to start us off because it's I think

2518
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:14,639
it'd be fun in the win wants to know

2519
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:16,520
what was your worst year with the worst

2520
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,779
outdoor season

2521
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:21,480
oh man

2522
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:23,759
so I've uh

2523
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:27,238
I I had 20

2524
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:31,380
years of Gorilla growing so I've had

2525
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:34,138
some pretty [ __ ] bad ones I bet um

2526
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:36,118
I'm trying to think

2527
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:40,739
so I've had yeah I've had some [ __ ]

2528
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:43,979
wiped out but the worst I had I had

2529
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:45,599
um a pretty decent outdoor for the area

2530
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:47,759
that I'm in

2531
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,079
um you know enough that you know

2532
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,119
there's some [ __ ] you thought about

2533
01:45:49,079 --> 01:45:56,100
before you fell asleep at night

2534
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:59,039
and um it was most mostly all in three

2535
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:00,300
sections kind of separated out

2536
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:04,260
um

2537
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:06,420
and in October the whole [ __ ] thing

2538
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:08,579
got ripped

2539
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:12,060
um I I lost plants

2540
01:46:08,579 --> 01:46:14,460
I've lost plants many times mid-season

2541
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:18,000
um but this one somebody got it somebody

2542
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:20,158
came and they got everything

2543
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,238
um completely ripped me off I had a lot

2544
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:25,079
riding on it I was pretty invested in

2545
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,259
that one

2546
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:31,079
um but they left I had a Neville's Haze

2547
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:33,840
plant out there that was [ __ ] massive

2548
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:37,019
taller than everything else

2549
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,880
and I guess they didn't see it

2550
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:41,460
um because it was you know it was mostly

2551
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,100
kind of hybrid style plants smaller

2552
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:46,439
bushier plants I had this one [ __ ]

2553
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:50,159
tree of a plant so

2554
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:52,799
I got ripped off I was [ __ ] defeated

2555
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:54,359
feeling like [ __ ] and I saw that they

2556
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,520
left that plant and it kind of sketched

2557
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:59,460
me out for a little bit

2558
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:01,380
um I bet you know I didn't want it I

2559
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:04,198
didn't want to cut it down

2560
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:06,659
um yeah you know I figured that was that

2561
01:47:04,198 --> 01:47:09,599
was left for me to get [ __ ] whatever

2562
01:47:06,658 --> 01:47:12,899
popped with her yeah so I I just let

2563
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:17,880
that thing go and we had a pretty

2564
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:19,799
pretty mild fall that year so

2565
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,779
you know I think it was a couple days

2566
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:24,119
after Thanksgiving I went back and it

2567
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:29,460
was still there and it was just about

2568
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:33,479
just about done and um I said I said

2569
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:35,340
[ __ ] it I'm gonna get it so I you know

2570
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:37,919
cut that plant down

2571
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,900
staff did appropriately drove it to

2572
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:42,899
where I was trying it

2573
01:47:39,899 --> 01:47:45,359
um so I pretty much

2574
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:48,359
lost my whole Harvest except the only

2575
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,979
thing I had to smoke until you know the

2576
01:47:48,359 --> 01:47:52,198
next indoor run I did which was probably

2577
01:47:49,979 --> 01:47:55,799
going to be in the spring was you know

2578
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:58,138
just all this Neville's Haze yeah and it

2579
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:02,279
was a phenomenal plant

2580
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:03,359
but it was so goddamn strong it was like

2581
01:48:02,279 --> 01:48:06,960
you know

2582
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:10,799
you can smoke that sometimes but you

2583
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:12,840
can't just like you know I was like four

2584
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:16,320
months into just smoking Devil's Haze

2585
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,699
all day like oh my God you smoke it you

2586
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:19,259
go to the grocery store or you like

2587
01:48:17,698 --> 01:48:20,879
start to walk in and you're like nah

2588
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:22,579
okay I can't do this [ __ ] right now you

2589
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,800
know like yeah

2590
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:27,960
it's just like but it was you know it

2591
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,639
was an electric winter

2592
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,060
um but that bad

2593
01:48:29,639 --> 01:48:36,000
yeah but I've had that I've had floods

2594
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:38,580
wiped out Gardens I've had

2595
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,100
you know outdoor growing is difficult

2596
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:42,300
enough outdoor Gorilla growing I mean

2597
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:45,539
you have to

2598
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:48,800
go into it hoping you get half of the

2599
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:48,800
work you put in out of it

2600
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:56,760
and like that would be so heavy to lose

2601
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:58,859
like a whole crop at like knowing each

2602
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,179
year in a row you can get ripped that

2603
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:04,019
would kill me

2604
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:06,719
yeah yeah it's um it sucks I'm glad I

2605
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:09,360
don't have to do that anymore

2606
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:11,698
yeah for sure

2607
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:14,519
I mean indoor growing you you know that

2608
01:49:11,698 --> 01:49:16,799
that's a possibility but like Gorilla

2609
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:19,260
growing it just seems like almost like a

2610
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,639
weird inevitability it's something yeah

2611
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:23,039
you know

2612
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,719
yeah it's you know there's so many

2613
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:28,198
different things that can happen you

2614
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:31,079
know people hunting people you know just

2615
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:34,439
everything yeah serial killers bearing

2616
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:36,679
bodies the normal [ __ ] exactly yeah all

2617
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:36,678
that

2618
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:43,260
okay

2619
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:44,698
um PBJ asks which of his lines would he

2620
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:49,739
suggest growing for each level of

2621
01:49:44,698 --> 01:49:49,738
experience novice intermediate advanced

2622
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:53,219
okay

2623
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:57,719
um so

2624
01:49:53,219 --> 01:50:00,179
the appalache stuff overall they're it's

2625
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:02,579
it makes for some very

2626
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:03,300
easy plants I think

2627
01:50:02,579 --> 01:50:05,760
um

2628
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:09,119
there there are some that are a little

2629
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:12,300
bit more finicky I think you know the

2630
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:14,059
dog [ __ ] Appalachia is a little a little

2631
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:17,820
more intermediate but for the most part

2632
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:21,300
those are pretty easy plants

2633
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:24,539
um as a beginner I would say that this

2634
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,520
the F3 Appalachia or the

2635
01:50:24,539 --> 01:50:29,460
um

2636
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:32,100
which is the old Betsy Appalachia those

2637
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,600
are I mean kind of set it and forget it

2638
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:36,119
plants

2639
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:38,460
um the intermediate ones would be stuff

2640
01:50:36,118 --> 01:50:40,259
like you know the lupus headband

2641
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,539
Appalachia

2642
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,560
um

2643
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:46,198
you know

2644
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:49,139
nah the GMO is pretty easy too

2645
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:50,819
um but you know when we if I end up

2646
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:54,000
releasing any of the hay stuff that's

2647
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:56,579
gonna be more on the advanced level of

2648
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,880
growing just because mango Haze itself

2649
01:50:56,579 --> 01:51:02,760
is Affinity plant and a lot of the cuts

2650
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:03,420
that I really liked that I'm using

2651
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:07,679
um

2652
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:10,079
as mothers uh a lot of those are you

2653
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:13,158
know more finicky plants you have they

2654
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:15,600
go longer you have a lot stretch

2655
01:51:13,158 --> 01:51:19,158
it's a lot more

2656
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,159
you have to think about it a lot more

2657
01:51:19,618 --> 01:51:23,039
nice

2658
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,380
thank you for that

2659
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:27,238
um we've got a big one from Blazer panda

2660
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:29,340
a good mate

2661
01:51:27,238 --> 01:51:32,759
does high emotion like to go by

2662
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:34,380
Appalachia daddy or father Abby that's a

2663
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:37,260
good question

2664
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:38,359
well local calls me Daddy so that's the

2665
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,699
thing that

2666
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:43,299
is true because local also asked what's

2667
01:51:41,698 --> 01:51:45,599
it like being my dad

2668
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:47,940
[Laughter]

2669
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:52,440
uh well you know that's another instance

2670
01:51:47,939 --> 01:51:52,439
of trying to set it and forget it right

2671
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,539
okay

2672
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:57,539
yep

2673
01:52:00,899 --> 01:52:03,599
more Earnest one

2674
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,819
um

2675
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:08,219
in the wind wants to know a bit more

2676
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:09,960
about your grow take

2677
01:52:08,219 --> 01:52:12,359
um

2678
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:14,460
he says like besides the soil mix what's

2679
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:16,819
your what are your veg weeks outdoor

2680
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:16,819
dates

2681
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:22,979
I guess he wants to know yeah

2682
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:27,000
um it it varies greatly

2683
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:27,959
um I kind of I I do a lot of different

2684
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,719
things

2685
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:32,100
um in the last few years I've gotten

2686
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:36,480
into

2687
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:40,800
um doing some light depths outside so

2688
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:43,919
um where I used to put plants out around

2689
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:47,639
you know the first of June

2690
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:50,880
now I'm I'm stepping in the spring and

2691
01:52:47,639 --> 01:52:52,139
my full season plants don't go out until

2692
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,480
um you know

2693
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:57,779
mid-july

2694
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:59,819
um but you know I do a lot of things a

2695
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:02,039
lot of different ways so

2696
01:52:59,819 --> 01:53:04,799
this year I did

2697
01:53:02,039 --> 01:53:08,819
um a depth run I have my

2698
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:11,760
full season stuff going now I have a few

2699
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:13,679
extra plants that are out in the gorilla

2700
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,539
Spa you know I just

2701
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,840
I don't have

2702
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:20,539
I'm always looking for the you know best

2703
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,800
way to

2704
01:53:20,539 --> 01:53:25,560
deal with all the seeds that I bought

2705
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,699
basically

2706
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,260
um

2707
01:53:26,698 --> 01:53:31,219
yeah

2708
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:31,219
chicken feed

2709
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:37,980
yeah and yeah soil mix I mean I did I do

2710
01:53:36,658 --> 01:53:40,259
almost

2711
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:42,599
almost fully organic

2712
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:44,760
um because I I just like a minted soil I

2713
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:47,039
like the way plants can kind of take

2714
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,940
what they want when they want it

2715
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:52,560
um yeah

2716
01:53:47,939 --> 01:53:55,678
and I try to try to keep you know

2717
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:58,699
fungus and bugs off them and kind of let

2718
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:58,699
them do their thing outside

2719
01:53:58,979 --> 01:54:03,000
yep

2720
01:54:00,359 --> 01:54:03,719
nice Okay

2721
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,579
um

2722
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:06,960
I know Matt you mentioned we probably

2723
01:54:05,579 --> 01:54:09,420
wouldn't get into the hypothetical

2724
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,859
breeding scenarios but I thought maroon

2725
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:12,658
did have an interesting one that I think

2726
01:54:10,859 --> 01:54:14,579
is Broad enough that we could maybe dip

2727
01:54:12,658 --> 01:54:18,379
into it which is the one where you have

2728
01:54:14,579 --> 01:54:20,579
to move on a freeway three-way

2729
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:22,819
oh wow Jesus

2730
01:54:20,579 --> 01:54:22,819
Jesus

2731
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:27,239
my God

2732
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,340
so his question is if you're going to

2733
01:54:27,238 --> 01:54:31,198
try and make a modern four-way what

2734
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:35,060
plants or at least what traditional

2735
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:35,059
regions do you think you might pull from

2736
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,579
uh would this be like Reinventing the

2737
01:54:39,179 --> 01:54:43,980
old four-way or like a just a four-way

2738
01:54:41,579 --> 01:54:47,819
hybrid of different I think a four-way

2739
01:54:43,979 --> 01:54:50,759
hybrid of your your choosing

2740
01:54:47,819 --> 01:54:53,599
um I would probably do

2741
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,600
a

2742
01:54:54,060 --> 01:55:00,300
a Colombian cross to a Mexican as the

2743
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:02,579
father plant

2744
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:05,360
and

2745
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:05,359
hmm

2746
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:11,939
I don't know it's hard to say in Afghani

2747
01:55:09,238 --> 01:55:13,919
because it's so Broad

2748
01:55:11,939 --> 01:55:17,359
um

2749
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,359
it'd probably be

2750
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:24,000
a Hawaiian Afghani cross to a

2751
01:55:21,179 --> 01:55:26,579
Mexican Colombian

2752
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,279
is what I would do

2753
01:55:26,579 --> 01:55:30,658
and when I say Hawaiian I'm thinking of

2754
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:34,500
like a

2755
01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:36,960
a hybrid type you know like Island weed

2756
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:40,219
an older you know older one

2757
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,219
like that Federation

2758
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:45,238
yeah something like that you know like

2759
01:55:43,738 --> 01:55:47,279
um a lot of

2760
01:55:45,238 --> 01:55:49,919
oh Hawking

2761
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:52,859
um was planted in Hawaii and they kind

2762
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:55,139
of added in Afghani as they got it and

2763
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:57,719
something with that influence I'm a

2764
01:55:55,139 --> 01:56:00,600
I'm a big fan of

2765
01:55:57,719 --> 01:56:02,880
Central American sativa's

2766
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:05,940
um I really like

2767
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:08,760
Southeast Asian ones but I don't like

2768
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:12,960
the intersex traits

2769
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:15,480
that are so abundant in those

2770
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:18,600
um so I'd probably keep it um

2771
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:21,718
Central American with just a touch of

2772
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:23,340
Afghani and Hawaiian

2773
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:24,779
boom

2774
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:27,319
how about you Matt

2775
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:29,059
how would you do this

2776
01:56:27,319 --> 01:56:31,319
man

2777
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:33,420
I'd be like what's the goal what's the

2778
01:56:31,319 --> 01:56:34,439
end goal what's the end goal here I

2779
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,880
don't know it'd probably end up with

2780
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:39,419
something blueberry though I don't know

2781
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:41,219
that's fine something blueberry what the

2782
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:43,020
[ __ ] else would they do

2783
01:56:41,219 --> 01:56:44,460
you know

2784
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:46,139
okay

2785
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:49,920
um I think the last one that I've got on

2786
01:56:46,139 --> 01:56:51,960
my list from Ring of Fire is how has

2787
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,399
your perception of the industry change

2788
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,399
over the years and why

2789
01:56:55,618 --> 01:57:02,219
uh well you know I I have never been an

2790
01:57:00,118 --> 01:57:06,920
industry guy

2791
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:09,960
um I don't I'm not a big fan of

2792
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:12,359
illegal weed scene in every instance

2793
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:15,060
that I've seen I've been to quite a few

2794
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:18,420
States I've seen a lot of

2795
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:21,000
um you know legal weed and it's it's not

2796
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,260
anything that I would want to be stuck

2797
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,079
smoking

2798
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:28,139
um I do

2799
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:29,880
I do like the

2800
01:57:28,139 --> 01:57:32,699
um

2801
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,960
the easy access for home Growers I think

2802
01:57:32,698 --> 01:57:35,879
that's huge

2803
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:39,060
um I think

2804
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:42,779
you know that that's just that's going

2805
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:46,800
to take cannabis further in the end than

2806
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:48,840
the commercialization of it I think

2807
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,340
um you know you hear a ton of people

2808
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,560
talk about

2809
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:55,079
Niche markets and you know how there's

2810
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:57,300
going to be a this you know top shelf

2811
01:57:55,079 --> 01:58:00,960
Market's gonna arise but I you know I

2812
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:05,880
think that's a long way off I think

2813
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:10,139
um you know the the only way to create

2814
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:13,199
a demand for something like that is to

2815
01:58:10,139 --> 01:58:15,659
have people you know become empowered to

2816
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:17,460
grow something different something

2817
01:58:15,658 --> 01:58:19,500
unique and you know with a more

2818
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:22,260
interesting eye and you know that's

2819
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:24,420
that's something that home Growers are

2820
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,560
going to do and share with their Circle

2821
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,960
and

2822
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:30,480
um I really think that's the the most

2823
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:34,439
viable path forward for

2824
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:36,779
the betterment of cannabis is through

2825
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:38,698
um Growers and you know obvious people

2826
01:58:36,779 --> 01:58:41,759
that are really passionate about it not

2827
01:58:38,698 --> 01:58:44,098
just looking for a paycheck by growing

2828
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:46,219
uh you know Warehouse of wedding cake or

2829
01:58:44,099 --> 01:58:46,219
something

2830
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:52,739
yeah for sure shout out to the homegoers

2831
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:55,219
um I think in many ways as well like the

2832
01:58:52,738 --> 01:58:58,379
last breeding series was

2833
01:58:55,219 --> 01:59:01,020
uh well for everyone but I think we are

2834
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:02,819
also have one eye for sure on the

2835
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:05,400
hobbyists and and people at home or

2836
01:59:02,819 --> 01:59:06,960
people growing in smaller spaces in

2837
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:08,759
general you know

2838
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:11,060
um yeah yeah I think that's a good

2839
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,060
sentiment

2840
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:17,158
yeah I don't have much advice for people

2841
01:59:13,738 --> 01:59:18,178
in big warehouses to be honest

2842
01:59:17,158 --> 01:59:20,698
okay

2843
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:22,980
I mean yeah I mean that's you know it's

2844
01:59:20,698 --> 01:59:23,939
it's big business they're they're just

2845
01:59:22,979 --> 01:59:26,399
trying to

2846
01:59:23,939 --> 01:59:28,379
you know trying to get by trying to make

2847
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:32,219
a marketable product that moves fast

2848
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:34,079
it's just you know it's big business

2849
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:35,819
yeah I just mean from the perspective of

2850
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:37,500
I just haven't like I wouldn't even know

2851
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:39,299
where to begin from that perspective

2852
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:42,000
because I just don't do it you know what

2853
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:45,440
I mean so yeah everything that we do is

2854
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,439
definitely targeted towards uh

2855
01:59:47,039 --> 01:59:53,460
um I am out of I am done with my list of

2856
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:55,618
community questions but uh hi nansem you

2857
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:58,020
we did talk about one thing

2858
01:59:55,618 --> 01:59:59,279
um before this chat which was you

2859
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:02,099
mentioned that you were actually drying

2860
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:05,039
seeds at the moment did you want to like

2861
02:00:02,099 --> 02:00:07,139
just touch on give a little you know

2862
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:09,118
quick overview of like how that process

2863
02:00:07,139 --> 02:00:11,099
works for you

2864
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,319
uh yeah so

2865
02:00:11,099 --> 02:00:16,380
um you know when I'd shop

2866
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:20,099
plants I'd pretty much treat them like

2867
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:22,679
their flour to dry them I try to

2868
02:00:20,099 --> 02:00:25,139
keep the temperature as low as possible

2869
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:27,118
which is difficult this time of year but

2870
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:30,539
you know that

2871
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:34,259
you know 60 60 rule I try to get close

2872
02:00:30,539 --> 02:00:37,260
to that and I'll drive slow

2873
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:39,840
um kind of let the seeds mature in the

2874
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:43,199
buds as as possible

2875
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:46,319
um a paper bag um when I when I shook

2876
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:51,059
seeds I will draw them further

2877
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:52,698
um on screens and I like to uh once

2878
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:55,020
they're good and dry I like to

2879
02:00:52,698 --> 02:00:57,960
refrigerate them for a while kind of you

2880
02:00:55,020 --> 02:01:00,420
know simulate a winter type period

2881
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:01,079
and then I will

2882
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:03,539
um

2883
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:05,760
generally start cracking them and

2884
02:01:03,539 --> 02:01:09,238
testing them out

2885
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:11,460
so yeah nothing nothing super fancy just

2886
02:01:09,238 --> 02:01:14,039
making sure I get as much of that

2887
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:16,198
moisture out as possible before I get

2888
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:18,479
them cold

2889
02:01:16,198 --> 02:01:20,039
no that's great you know I think these

2890
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:22,379
are just the little ways we can extend

2891
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:25,019
on you know say that seed making episode

2892
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:27,900
that we did by asking you guys about

2893
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:31,260
some of your actual processes

2894
