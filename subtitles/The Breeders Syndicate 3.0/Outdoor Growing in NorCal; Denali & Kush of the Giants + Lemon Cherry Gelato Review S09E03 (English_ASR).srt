10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,479
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,460
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,100

00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,279
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,200

00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:22,438

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,359

00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,700
Ado thousand you want to take it away

yeah we get we even get Denali on the

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,500
camera that's amazing I know okay

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,060
um you all have no idea how lucky you

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,040
are

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,040
um yeah so as Matt mentioned you know

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,700
today we have a little round table on

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,640
outdoor growing and we

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,040
met and also I think typically have not

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,599
uh covered growing that much and so we

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,960
thought we would

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,578
ease our way there uh talking to a good

49
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,578
friend's Denali and Kush of the Giants

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
what was that what's the Missoula ease

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,039
it in

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
it's called denali's joke

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,000
um and yeah I guess we start at the

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,580
start a little bit of an interest

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,680
introduction from both of you perhaps

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,780
um where you know where have you been

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,580
growing if you can disclose that or in

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,620
as much detail as you'd like to disclose

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,340
and how long have you been growing

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,340
Outdoors for

61
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,580
uh go ahead D I'll let you take the

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:37,560
first one uh I figure you might ah geez

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:40,140
first down girl was 1980 uh yeah in a

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,420
little creek bed that uh I just dug up

65
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,359
the soil and removed some big rocks out

66
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,238
of the pop the hole and uh

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,800
planted a few seeds one came up

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,259
so uh and I use Miracle Grow you know

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,000
that's a huge back there I think a lot

70
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,299
of people did yeah not a lot of options

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,439
right no no not a lot of options

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,360
um I think like 1985 or uh some

73
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,699
somewhere right right about there that

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,920
uh we started adding amendments and

75
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,959
things like that to a blood meal and

76
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:17,280
bone meal and stuff like that

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,098
but uh still never got into uh what what

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,140
they do nowadays we worked well those do

79
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,579
it you you kind of skipped over

80
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,738
something so your your first indoor

81
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,000
grows or outdoor grows you saw or what

82
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:33,239
year uh 1980 oh that I saw that you saw

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,080
I didn't move up till uh up here uh

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,239
until uh 79. okay and I did put a couple

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,340
seeds just like a half an inch in the

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,459
ground super hard soil they didn't grow

87
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,280
yeah and at that time I wasn't uh

88
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,739
connected with anybody it was uh it was

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,140
uh very low-key yeah it would be hard to

90
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,939
connect right in that era yeah it was it

91
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,738
was hard to get weed when I first got

92
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,219
here you know because people just don't

93
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,799
trust you [ __ ] yeah it was it was a bad

94
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:04,199
scene back there getting caught but uh

95
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,120
how'd you get into smoking during

96
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,219
your era I mean because you're you're

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,920
probably I would say two generations of

98
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,878
Growers aside away from me

99
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,458
um

100
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,879
I was back in

101
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:21,540
1975. I uh uh girlfriend broke up with

102
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,879
me and I was uh bummed and I can't

103
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,000
buddies came by uh

104
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,159
and I remember Mikey had a 1969 Camaro

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,319
when we were going to Cruz and I was

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,240
sitting in the back seat and Pat

107
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,459
uh he said hey we're gonna fire up a

108
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,180
joint and I said I never smoked it

109
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,418
before

110
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,418
and uh he said well you're gonna take a

111
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:44,579
hit and I said uh sure I'll try it and

112
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,500
he said well just go ahead and solo it

113
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:52,019
so I sat back there and I smoked half

114
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,019
that joint and I never got high yeah

115
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,019
but that was uh very first time I smoked

116
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:02,939
weed uh and the third time I smelled

117
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:06,060
weed that I did get high and uh for me I

118
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:09,120
I was I lived in sheltered life you know

119
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,120
my dad he wrote his Congressman about

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,340
Playboy

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,800
they were totally against drugs oh yeah

122
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,978
all right mom got upset when I named my

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,079
little hamster Hashimoto at her no

124
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,079
because it had hashes

125
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,000
who's dark and yeah but uh that that's

126
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,520
how I started but like the third time I

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,600
got stoned man I could talk to the girls

128
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:39,000
and stuff like that that that was it for

129
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,639
me you know I started smoking all the

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,199
time regularly after that parties things

131
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,660
like that

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,240
that's funny never dated in high school

133
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,580
anything like that you know yeah just

134
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,079
knowing you like it's funny because I

135
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,699
can't I can probably count the number of

136
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,599
times like I've been like hey you know

137
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,220
you want to try this and you're like

138
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,900
[ __ ] yeah let's do it like you're always

139
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,199
the first one that's down to just try

140
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,638
whatever I love it yeah so the fact that

141
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,259
you ever had a time period where you

142
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,699
hadn't smoked weed and were just like

143
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:12,538
maybe you know it's fun I was 19. that's

144
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:15,840
so funny never in high school you know

145
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:20,159
I got a couple of uh questions here for

146
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,839
Denali so you started going in 1980 uh

147
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,060
did you take have you taken in many

148
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,519
breaks between then and now

149
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,220
oh yeah yeah I would get transferred

150
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:33,779
with the company I was working with and

151
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:38,340
um I wouldn't grow and uh we moved to uh

152
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:39,899
uh Association uh HOA and uh you

153
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,719
couldn't put up fences and things like

154
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,939
that and uh there was years I didn't

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,860
grow you know but I knew people that

156
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,959
were growing so it wasn't hard getting

157
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,199
weed yeah you're always kind of stayed

158
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:55,680
in the scene yeah yeah and that first

159
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,199
time getting high it's it's been forever

160
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,379
and that's why he's the done right there

161
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,819
right what kind of um when you were

162
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,860
first starting growing what kind of

163
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,340
information did you have access to about

164
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,340
the plant zero

165
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,660
yeah Henry books or anything like that I

166
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,359
didn't talk to anybody I just uh did

167
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,520
what I thought yeah and so you just

168
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,720
figured it out as you went on I guess oh

169
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:27,899
yeah and uh uh I've learned so much more

170
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,400
since being in this group than I have in

171
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,198
all those years prior

172
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,939
so you felt your way through it like

173
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,020
making love to a man like your first

174
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,779
time you just kind of feel your way

175
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,459
through it yeah yeah it happened that's

176
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:43,978
what Amazon is for

177
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:46,019
yeah I mean that's right right not bad

178
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:48,240
um did I miss this Denali did you tell

179
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:51,719
us you know roughly where you were based

180
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,060
I mean you don't have to but uh

181
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,220
yeah it's no big deal I think a lot of

182
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,879
my ID pictures show where I'm at I'm in

183
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:04,020
Lake County in North California Nor Cal

184
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,180
baby yeah yeah I'm saying 79.

185
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,098
all right how about you because you're

186
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,500
the Giants when did you start and where

187
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:13,019
are you growing at the moment so I

188
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,300
started in 2008

189
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,879
um when I turned 18.

190
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,740
um but since I was about 14 or 15 I was

191
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,899
always in my brother's Garden he's the

192
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,000
one who introduced me to the plant and

193
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,978
when he was watering or taking care of

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,500
his stuff I was always out there helping

195
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:29,839
him and bullshitting with them

196
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,240
um and I'm about

197
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,639
180 miles north of Denali in between

198
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,479
Shasta and Lassen County in the in the

199
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,479
Foothills the lesson

200
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,679
for those of us who are like not super

201
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,239
familiar with the geography there how

202
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,338
similar would you say the conditions are

203
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,680
between where you two are growing living

204
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:55,640
he's uh he's in the valley and he gets

205
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:59,159
uh he gets a higher heat index than I do

206
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,360
and I live on the side of a mountain so

207
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,719
we we share a lot of the same

208
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,180
similarities and our heat but when it

209
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,639
comes to like things dealing with like

210
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,319
the cooling off at Night My I think my

211
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,720
temperatures drop off a lot more than

212
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,140
people down in the valley at sea level

213
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,139
Doom

214
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,299
yeah

215
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,700
yeah nice

216
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:24,599
um Asian are you good

217
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,339
I'm at 3 400. yeah I'm like 13.

218
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,800
yeah

219
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:32,580
yeah well Lake County also has an

220
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,439
interesting like aspect to it with the

221
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,040
like living next to the water like

222
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,540
that's kind of my aspect

223
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,240
sorry I have to do it every time someone

224
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,439
says that like I was wondering where

225
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,519
that came from I didn't realize I was

226
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,620
like what

227
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,820
caught me off guard first I was like

228
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,820
wait it's not so listening

229
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,539
yeah no he's on demand's table

230
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,539
I think uh I think living right on the

231
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,699
Lake Edge and growing right on the in

232
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,860
that area has has a huge effect on on

233
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,060
your plants um I think I think it's a

234
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,159
totally different environment than what

235
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,619
I'm dealing with

236
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,240
yeah I mean I guess we should say right

237
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,740
off the bat that one obviously one of

238
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,259
the biggest differences between going

239
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,080
outdoors and indoors is that you are

240
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,299
very much constrained by your immediate

241
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,820
environment and in some ways that's

242
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,679
going to be a running theme through this

243
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,060
talk

244
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,979
um

245
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,419
actually on that note I did want to ask

246
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,980
you to as well as part of this like

247
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:32,659
intro

248
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,659
um have you two grown indoors much

249
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:38,939
I I haven't first indoor grow I had was

250
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,639
1988.

251
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,640
and uh that was underneath the house

252
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,500
and a buddy had a

253
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,278
couple clones

254
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
that uh there's a story about and uh

255
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:57,000
I grew them one year

256
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,159
and uh uh went to a rehab

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,500
so I uh

258
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,740
didn't grow any for another probably two

259
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,899
years after that uh but I never really

260
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,419
got into indoor grown because uh the

261
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,958
climate's so good up here and that uh I

262
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,958
could grow outside

263
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,899
did you wanna

264
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,899
do you want to dip into that little

265
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,820
story that you just mentioned yeah

266
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,019
you know some people say it's [ __ ]

267
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,660
you know but that's okay

268
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:30,600
the way it is

269
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,620
1985 I met a guy uh we started fishing

270
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,379
together

271
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,459
and he had uh he took me over to his

272
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,278
house and walked me out to a barn and

273
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:44,338
went in the barn and here's all these

274
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,159
pot plants growing this little bitty top

275
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,620
tiny pot plants maybe a foot tall

276
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,620
and uh had them under lights

277
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,139
and he was using CO2 he was taking his

278
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,500
own clones he was uh

279
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:01,439
uh the lights he was using metal halide

280
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,019
and high pressure sodium so he was

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,779
Advanced for that year like doing CO2

282
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,578
everything yeah yeah

283
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:11,879
high pressure sodium lights were on a

284
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:14,819
track and they wow and um

285
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,639
uh he had this whole operation going on

286
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,260
and uh he told me the story of where he

287
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,539
got these two cuts

288
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,600
and uh

289
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:28,620
uh a friend of his with an electrician

290
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,440
I'll work up in uh the Northwest and uh

291
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,959
uh University up there

292
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,300
and when he came back

293
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,578
his buddy started growing these well

294
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,278
they those two were friends because uh

295
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,078
their two uh ladies they were with went

296
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,820
to high school together and they were

297
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,539
best friends in high school so that's

298
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:52,278
how uh Tom and I'm calling Carlos Carlos

299
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:52,278
met and uh

300
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,279
Tom turned him on to these cuts that he

301
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,919
brought back from the northwest

302
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,879
and one was green one with a little bit

303
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,338
purple

304
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,000
and he said that that's where they came

305
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,320
from in 1985 was the University up in

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,679
Northwest

307
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,200
and uh he was uh growing in uh

308
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,138
vermiculite and paralyte and I believe

309
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,240
it was about age 70 30 something like

310
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,839
that

311
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,579
and two gallon pots and he would uh veg

312
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,700
for 10 days

313
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:29,458
and he would take them at eight weeks

314
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,620
and just like clockwork and that [ __ ]

315
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:34,679
was so Stony the green one would stick

316
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,459
to the bag and the purple one wasn't as

317
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,919
high

318
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:41,578
you can get the same high out of it but

319
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,939
uh it was still primo weed at the time

320
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:47,338
so I I buddied up with him uh real quick

321
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,200
and to the to this day we're still

322
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,120
friends

323
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,860
1985 with the early afghanis that's

324
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,159
that's pretty impressive you know like

325
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,300
it's an early time you know like the

326
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,039
fact that you mentioned they stick to

327
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,899
the bag stuff like that that's a common

328
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,278
thing that I've heard about how like

329
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,539
people are so used to certain types of

330
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,399
Bud that when they found something that

331
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,958
was like physically sticky they would

332
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,078
stick to things that really really like

333
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,259
freaked him out it was a trip

334
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,379
and if anybody could tell me

335
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,659
how he knew the story about these two

336
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:22,379
one green one purple

337
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:25,439
from the University up in the northwest

338
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:28,559
how did you know that story in 1985.

339
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,519
yeah I'm gay if somebody can tell me

340
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,518
that then

341
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,679
what he had was the UW so what do you

342
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,540
think um you've had time with the the

343
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,819
pnw hash plant now yeah

344
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:44,519
yeah a little bit what did you think

345
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,680
compared to comparatively

346
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,539
yeah pucky

347
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,479
uh

348
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,360
I would say more like it yeah

349
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,940
um it it not full of resin at least not

350
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,579
the way I grow it but I'm not doing what

351
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,339
he did you know I've always wanted to

352
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:04,259
take both those cuts and run them just

353
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,060
like he did and see what they would do

354
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,980
it sounds like he was using like an

355
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,138
early form of the hempy bucket system

356
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,959
which is just you know perlite and

357
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:15,778
nutrients just constantly feeding

358
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,759
it used a uh I remember when I first met

359
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,360
him he was using uh

360
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,559
Violet food because no really uh

361
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,600
variegated

362
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,939
violet plant is variegated like a

363
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,420
cannabis plant then he switched it over

364
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,060
to Jacks 20 oh Jacks yeah 2020. and I

365
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:36,539
think it was like 5 50 18 or something

366
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,919
like that Jesus that's funny yeah Jax

367
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,500
makes sense a lot of people use that too

368
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,620
during that time

369
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,019
yeah I've used it a few years ago it

370
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,198
still works that's some great insight

371
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,578
into the to the possible UW uh Origins

372
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,838
and it's it's one of the better ones

373
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:55,620
that we've seen where there's pictures

374
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,660
and you know uh testimony about it that

375
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,139
far back

376
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:04,439
well you know I just I know what he told

377
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,299
me yeah you know that's it that's all I

378
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,779
know and he couldn't have known that

379
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:11,159
story without it happening yeah and this

380
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:14,639
dude's still around

381
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,120
oh yeah oh yeah he's the most arrogant

382
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,039
piece of [ __ ]

383
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,240
I would get him on a show but he would

384
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,240
tell you how great he is

385
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:28,860
he sounds like he's pretty great though

386
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:30,319
you know he still swears he grows best

387
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,039
we in the world

388
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,690
does he

389
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,919
uh yeah it's pretty good

390
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,440
[Laughter]

391
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:43,139
85 years running like light lights on

392
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,880
Rails and [ __ ] that's that's so Advanced

393
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,539
that's so Advanced that's really cool

394
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,220
yeah he was taking it down to L.A

395
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,399
getting ready about like four thousand a

396
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,180
pound yeah oh my God whoa just murdering

397
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,339
it

398
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,439
yeah some guys I'm just gonna button and

399
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,600
say that uh even though this is a bit of

400
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,220
a tangent I think we want to get a few

401
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,099
stories out of Denali because obviously

402
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,798
he's witnessed a lot yeah absolutely

403
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:11,000
yeah just a bit

404
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:15,000
it's been a fun ride

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,439
fun ride all right well cush with the

406
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,880
Giants like have you had much experience

407
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,798
growing indoors and why I'm asking you

408
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,199
both this is just so we can later on

409
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,000
kind of I want to get to teasing out you

410
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,919
know some of the like

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,160
uh differences

412
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,440
yeah so I play around a little bit

413
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,740
indoors but it's usually after my

414
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,660
outdoor season is done and in my section

415
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,819
of the mountain pretty much for about

416
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,220
four months out of the year we have a

417
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,619
foot of snow on the ground or more and

418
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,079
so when that happens and I'm done with

419
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:50,038
Harvest and everything's taken care of

420
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,379
that's when I swap into indoor mode and

421
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,379
um my indoor stuff is always playing

422
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,440
around trying new stuff trying mediums

423
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,919
like trying pure cocoa or trying some

424
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,558
dwc buckets it's always been just just

425
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,799
something new and fresh to just play

426
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,899
around and give something new a try

427
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,700
yeah so for you you're indoors you're

428
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,559
kind of like yearly Focus I mean sorry

429
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,600
your outdoor is like your main focus and

430
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,599
your indoor is a bit of a like play

431
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:21,058
around experiment right yes and and

432
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,798
another reason why that is is uh due to

433
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:27,000
power outages I live in such a rural

434
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:29,879
area that I'm used to losing like 17 18

435
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,759
days of power throughout my four month

436
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,260
five month winter so a lot of my yeah

437
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,058
dude I've had a lot of runs where it's

438
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,779
like okay well today's day five without

439
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:42,599
any lights so I'm I'll just runs over so

440
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,940
you know wow uh do you have like

441
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,099
generator backups yeah I have

442
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,380
I have backups and stuff but

443
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:52,139
like I said the grow is always like

444
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,600
secondary it's not my main focus so I've

445
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,820
never had the the that uh specific

446
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,678
breaker panel set up on the automatic

447
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,579
generator it's it's in the garage not on

448
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,580
the main house so

449
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,140
yeah I get you yeah okay uh I plan on

450
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,538
eventually upgrading to where when we

451
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,360
lose power I can still have the tents

452
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:14,579
running but it's just not a main major

453
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,619
priority for me right now

454
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,319
no that would be a huge project in and

455
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,939
of itself I imagine

456
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,918
yeah I looked at getting the generator

457
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,320
the uh the generators installed for auto

458
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,120
swap over and yeah it's it's a little

459
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,980
expensive but but definitely worth it

460
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,439
for for the projects that I plan on

461
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,759
doing in the future

462
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,798
I get you

463
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,960
okay yeah well thank you both for

464
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,460
telling us a bit about you know how long

465
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,919
you've been growing for you know your

466
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,500
relative experience

467
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,059
um I think one important thing that I've

468
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,940
talked to

469
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:50,759
I think cush and maybe Matt as well you

470
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,740
know in starting to approach growing

471
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,779
information I think we want to be quite

472
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,759
careful about how we frame this

473
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,980
information like we're we're definitely

474
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,660
not trying to tell people that like this

475
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,000
is your you know quote-unquote ultimate

476
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:06,000
guide you know insert YouTube clickbait

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,579
Title Here to Growing or anything like

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,359
that I think for me

479
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:17,359
um my idea is that we just try to uh

480
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,579
share and be explicit about the

481
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,259
diversity of environments and conditions

482
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,038
that people different people are growing

483
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,298
in

484
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,679
um because

485
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,179
uh

486
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,820
different people have just very

487
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,960
different growing situations

488
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:38,460
um okay well we can actually get into

489
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:41,100
a bit more of the uh core growing issues

490
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,600
and the first thing that stands out when

491
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,759
we talk about outdoor growing is

492
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,980
obviously going to be climate I think

493
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,779
for a lot of people

494
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,400
um you two did touch on climate a little

495
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,160
bit but can you tell us again you know

496
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,600
how would you describe the climate in

497
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,600
your where you're growing

498
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:04,679
so yeah yeah it's it's Aaron hot and

499
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,259
arid for like most of all of July all of

500
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,820
August most of September and then right

501
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,019
around the end of September and the

502
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,000
start of October we get some pretty

503
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,240
heavy showers

504
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,019
how okay maybe because you start how how

505
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,538
have you had to adapt to that or like

506
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,500
um how do you see your grow kind of

507
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,700
being

508
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,679
um

509
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,640
I don't know yeah having having evolved

510
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,340
to deal with that so my challenges with

511
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,220
the climate have changed as my goals

512
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:38,099
have changed with my garden

513
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,980
um for instance back when I was mono

514
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:43,740
cropping a single strain and trying to

515
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,140
get as much weight as possible I worried

516
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,419
quite a bit about the climate and making

517
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,179
sure that I harvest before a heavy rain

518
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:54,360
comes you know I'm more worried about pm

519
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:56,580
and Bud rot and these things because

520
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,459
because weight is my main goal but in

521
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,379
the last three or four years those goals

522
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,620
have shifted because nobody's buying

523
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,480
that weight anymore and so now I I don't

524
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,558
worry about the climate as much if a

525
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,640
plant is expressing some PM or

526
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,918
expressing some mold I'm not going to

527
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,500
cut it down right away I'm trying to see

528
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,659
what this plant is natural resistances

529
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,640
are like I'm going to harvest enough out

530
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,980
of it to where I'm not worried about

531
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
getting every ounce and every gram off

532
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,880
of it so I get to see some more

533
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,038
Expressions rather than worry about my

534
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,780
making sure I harvest every plant at its

535
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,779
maximum weight potential

536
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:37,619
nice

537
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,798
how about you Denali

538
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,658
I don't remember what the question was

539
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,798
so I guess it was yeah first a little

540
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,620
bit about the climate that you're

541
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,480
growing in and secondarily how have you

542
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:49,500
like dealt with that

543
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,279
well

544
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,279
uh

545
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,579
I've been trying to pick strains that uh

546
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,500
big Kush and man

547
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,579
um

548
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,140
someone's picking up a lot of background

549
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:09,019
so you can tell her we love her right

550
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,020
back yeah yeah love you

551
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,960
go what I mean I mean yeah she wanted to

552
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,879
show me show you what she made

553
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,159
um

554
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,919
she made replicated the jalapeno poppers

555
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,840
they looked exactly the same too bro I

556
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,340
ate so many of those and like you know

557
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:30,359
my diet I wasn't supposed to be eating

558
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:32,158
that [ __ ] that was so good right bro I'm

559
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,819
those are those are coming again those

560
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,980
are absolutely being made again big you

561
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:42,178
know it's it's uh like Kush this it's

562
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,759
dry and hotter than hell here and uh it

563
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:47,820
rained earlier today here

564
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,798
and so that was just a freak thing but

565
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:53,158
uh in September it starts to cool down

566
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,418
we get a little more rain and uh if it

567
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,520
gets bad enough you got to worry about

568
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,820
the mold and things like that

569
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,619
uh for me uh where I live

570
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:04,798
um it's like every year I get a

571
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:07,139
different kind of critter you know it

572
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,058
might be like one year it might be trips

573
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,240
when you're might be white lighted one

574
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:14,700
year and um

575
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,620
yeah you have to deal with them

576
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,440
and uh

577
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:23,579
do you have any good stories about this

578
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,759
yeah God I remember plants just covered

579
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:30,178
yeah just covered uh

580
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:33,538
not all of them some of them but

581
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:37,019
semi bug resistant you know you just

582
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:41,058
don't get on them I've only had a

583
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,058
uh no bad ones uh

584
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,140
russets oh God yeah one time and I just

585
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:51,359
any plant that had them I cut it down

586
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,380
and put them in my green barrel and got

587
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,599
rid of them

588
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,559
and uh just didn't have that much that

589
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,279
year

590
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:02,639
jeez but uh I I think it's damn near the

591
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,879
perfect uh environment here for cannabis

592
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,940
for certain times you know there's those

593
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,940
uh 19 weakers Jamba yeah yeah

594
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:17,719
January there's no way

595
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,340
I mean on on that topic of pest Denali

596
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,419
uh is there anything you do to try to

597
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,599
mitigate

598
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:27,059
against this I used a three-in-one stuff

599
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,879
you know I don't I don't want free

600
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:32,278
anything in flour but yeah spring in one

601
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,740
is uh that and depending on the bug

602
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,558
there's white fly stuff and

603
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,659
I'll use neem I don't like name

604
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,158
personally I can't stand the smell of it

605
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,080
anymore I can't stand the smell I'm

606
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,539
traumatized by it either it's so

607
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,038
effective other than as a leaf shine you

608
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,158
know it's good for shining your leaves

609
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,259
and that's about it in my opinion and we

610
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,299
have a lot of them uh cabbage Moss here

611
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,538
and they they had a little bit

612
00:25:54,298 --> 00:26:00,058
absolutely the caterpillar goes in and

613
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,319
uh caterpillar caterpillar killer it

614
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,079
works good

615
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:08,220
you know and it's been a sad it's pretty

616
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,658
much for that that uh uh that bug is

617
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,960
that are you talking about spinosad or

618
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,960
BT no no BT BT yeah yeah

619
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,819
um what do you have to do with any like

620
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,319
mammals

621
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:25,259
uh like gophers

622
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,939
yeah I guess or yeah whatever else

623
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:28,140
that's out Gophers are a big one like if

624
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,200
you plant straight in the ground right

625
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,140
like that's a real issue yep where I'm

626
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,798
living uh they brought this dirt in and

627
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,559
packed it in and made canals in here and

628
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,599
I haven't seen it over here in 40 years

629
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,178
oh my God we've been dealing with them

630
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,399
all like the last two years at this

631
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,538
place it's been nightmare anytime we

632
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,759
plant something in the ground whether

633
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:53,940
it's a fig tree cannabis anything it's

634
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,579
just ravaged instantly

635
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,620
I I don't know what it is raccoons mess

636
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:01,619
with plants no

637
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,778
yeah the red Terrors they're evil if do

638
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:07,379
you guys have raccoons in New Zealand

639
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:09,000
no we have like uh what's the closest

640
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,980
things that we've got to that we've got

641
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,538
kind of like stoked or weasel type

642
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,980
things okay

643
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:15,720
yeah raccoons are they're a nightmare

644
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,400
trash pandas they're the worst they're

645
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,700
like they're mean too they're vicious

646
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,480
little shits they don't [ __ ] around

647
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,360
yeah there's a herd of them around here

648
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,460
but now we don't have any uh gophers or

649
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,459
molds or anything like that I know guys

650
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,980
uh uh in the valley where they have

651
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,019
garden and right in the soil they have

652
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,000
just hundreds of them

653
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,099
cheese

654
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,599
coach might have ground squirrels up

655
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:44,639
there I don't know if they have that yep

656
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,980
yeah every once in a while so I've only

657
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,320
had it happen once out of all the the

658
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,298
cultivars that I've grown I had a train

659
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,700
wreck across to a Salmon Creek big bug

660
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:56,158
and for some reason the gray squirrels

661
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,140
literally ate the nugs off of the plant

662
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,360
at about week four or five and that's

663
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,038
the only plant they touched it was

664
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,479
really weird

665
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,700
there was something about the turp

666
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,038
profile or that specific plant that they

667
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,019
liked enough to just literally gnaw on

668
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:11,819
the tops of the plants like that it was

669
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,400
it was incredible

670
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:15,899
what about um pests in general for you

671
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,778
Kush what other things have you

672
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,659
encountered bugs other mammals rodents

673
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:24,900
um so in my area there's tons and tons

674
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,120
of mule deer and black tails and uh on

675
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,580
my Ig on my photos every plant you'll

676
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,239
see will have an internal cage with

677
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:35,339
about a three foot diameter and that

678
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,079
cage not only provides structure for the

679
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,298
plant but it protects from deer that

680
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,599
want to come and Chomp uh the plant down

681
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:45,418
to the stock and if I didn't have those

682
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,740
internal cages protecting them then all

683
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,538
of those plants would get chomped down

684
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,599
by deer

685
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:53,460
and uh as far as mammal goes that's

686
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,359
that's the most mammals that I have to

687
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,259
deal with

688
00:28:54,359 --> 00:29:00,000
um and then pests actual bugs thankfully

689
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,919
I've never had to deal with mites and

690
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,599
I've never had to deal with caterpillars

691
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:09,538
but I do have to deal with aphids and my

692
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:12,959
first year dealing with aphids was 2019.

693
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:15,298
and I attacked the aphids instead of

694
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,460
attacking the ants which the ants are

695
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:21,119
symbiotic they carry the aphids onto the

696
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:23,759
plant aphids drink the suck the life out

697
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,439
of the plant they poop out this honeydew

698
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,919
the ants harvest the Honeydew it's a

699
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,259
whole symbiotic relationship and the

700
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,080
second I started attacking the ants the

701
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:36,119
aphids no longer became a problem and

702
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,240
the best thing that I found is food

703
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:41,579
grade Diatomaceous earth I sprinkle it

704
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,579
in a heavy ring around the base of my

705
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:47,418
pot and it acts as a barrier that they

706
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,418
will not cross through

707
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:56,639
yes sir you have uh wood rats up there

708
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,740
no no no issues with wood rats yeah

709
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,740
because they have them here and what

710
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,140
they'll do is they'll just eat eat uh

711
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,419
outside of your plan away just round in

712
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,880
a circle at the base

713
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,980
I think that when they girdle it and

714
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,080
that it'll kill him what a lot of guys

715
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,038
do is they just put out bowls of water

716
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:19,099
for them

717
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:21,619
right right yeah that's smart yeah

718
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:24,119
what do they do with the water

719
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:26,639
why they're that's why they're yeah

720
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,778
that's why they're at the plants I

721
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,299
always wondered like because I've had

722
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:32,159
rats like paratroop and indoor grows and

723
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:33,658
like garages like we're you know 14 feet

724
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,520
up and there's no way for them to get in

725
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,840
I've got chicken wire everywhere I think

726
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,058
um and they would come in through the

727
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,759
tops and every time all they would do is

728
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:43,859
like girdle like at the bottom base of

729
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,079
the plant and not nothing else and that

730
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,479
was it like it would be done one bite on

731
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,418
[ __ ] and be done yeah it was so

732
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,759
painful just put them out some water

733
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:56,340
that's wild I had no clue I was like

734
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,558
tripping on my own glue traps and [ __ ]

735
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,259
you got to be kind to your guests you

736
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,058
know you gotta give them Provisions yeah

737
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:07,200
and [ __ ] with your [ __ ] you know like

738
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:09,359
the Santa Claus Harmony uh

739
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,538
other thing I'd like to add with pests

740
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,879
is there's a really cool insect called a

741
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:17,480
Green Lace wing and introducing those to

742
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,039
my garden has been one of the coolest

743
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,278
symbiotic like things I've ever seen in

744
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:26,158
my garden their their life cycle is to

745
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,558
literally kill aphids and reproduce into

746
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,899
these really cool flying insects that

747
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,658
are that are really quite beautiful and

748
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:36,778
for people who don't have ants but have

749
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,659
aphids they usually resort to ladybugs

750
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:41,099
and if if you're buying ladybugs to

751
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,260
protect your plants I highly suggest

752
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,778
buying Green Lace wings as well either

753
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,440
in their larva form or in the egg form

754
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:51,480
and then getting them on your plants

755
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,399
yeah it's it's really cool to study the

756
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,038
life cycle and understand how they work

757
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,019
and it's really one of the most brutal

758
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,599
like aspects of nature I've ever seen

759
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:03,359
because the The larva form of this

760
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,538
insect it's literally a miniature grub

761
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,538
with a giant uh Spike on its head and it

762
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:12,658
Rams the a holds it above its head and

763
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:14,339
it drinks the fluid as it's draining the

764
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,260
blood out of it yeah with from a spike

765
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,778
on its head yeah and then it throws the

766
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:21,179
corpse on its back and uses it as a

767
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:22,619
disguise so that other aphids don't know

768
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,640
that it's a predator it literally

769
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:25,639
disguises itself

770
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,820
they're called aphid Lions when they're

771
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,740
in that stage and if you look up some

772
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,119
YouTube videos on them it's it's one of

773
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,980
the coolest things in nature one of the

774
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,000
most brutal things in nature I've ever

775
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,899
seen

776
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,898
Wow nature is metal it really is

777
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:46,440
that's amazing I'm actually going and

778
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,259
buying these right now because you know

779
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,640
I've had problems um also because I

780
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,740
don't do a lot of outdoor I haven't done

781
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,020
like even even when I was doing outdoor

782
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,480
like it was usually greenhouse and then

783
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,740
it was like because something messed up

784
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,019
with a greenhouse we ended up on the

785
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,120
back of the hillside you know so trying

786
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,679
to do outdoors been really really like

787
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,678
butting my head against the wall when it

788
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,500
comes to to pests be it frips or aphids

789
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,500
do you guys have any tips for thrips

790
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,778
so I ever since I've been in the same

791
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,640
Valley within the same like three 400

792
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:20,819
yards in this little Valley growing for

793
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,460
the past since 2008 and every year on

794
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:26,460
like one percent of my fan leaves I see

795
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,980
thrip damage but it's it's so minuscule

796
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,538
that I've never seen it as an issue

797
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,579
where I have to tackle it I've never had

798
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:33,919
such a thrip infestation that it becomes

799
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:36,119
a huge problem

800
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,038
especially when I'm looking at a very

801
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,898
small amount of fan Leafs that have the

802
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:42,599
little bit of damage sure yeah it's not

803
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:46,199
as big of a deal at that point right I

804
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:48,240
had trips one year and in flower latent

805
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,058
flower and you do a [ __ ] and thing about

806
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,380
them

807
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:54,240
nothing about them you know all I can

808
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:58,460
just spray my buds or anything right

809
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,460
yeah yeah they've been brutal here

810
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,359
I think that's one thing with outdoor

811
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,000
growing is you're never gonna have a

812
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,759
plant that's like at least in my

813
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,159
subjective experience I've never had a

814
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,280
plant that's uh like

815
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,579
yeah not what's word I'm looking for

816
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,639
um impervious to to pests when you're

817
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,960
growing outdoor in that environment your

818
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,220
plants are going to have something on

819
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,139
them at some point

820
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,579
yeah it's been it's been hard trying to

821
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,500
explain this to my chick because she's

822
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,598
seen my indoor Grows Right and she's

823
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,940
used to seeing like no pests and

824
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,338
Outdoors she's like what is going on

825
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,918
like why can't it look like that why

826
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:39,719
isn't it it's it's try to explain like

827
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,039
how much you have to stay on top of

828
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,079
spraying how much you have to stay on

829
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,759
top of all this just to have those kind

830
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,619
of perfect leaves and everything it's

831
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,800
just it's hard to stay on top of it's

832
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:53,460
it's hard

833
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,039
what's funny is uh way back in the 80s I

834
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:00,480
don't remember bug

835
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:02,400
I do not have bugs wow

836
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,500
you know they they introduce a lot of

837
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,019
bugs in the states like I know here they

838
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,039
put spider mites on the uh edges of

839
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,199
freeways

840
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,460
like in the in the garden area there to

841
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,799
take care of whatever bugs they have

842
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,440
there but of course these all end up in

843
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,839
in North Rose here it's just

844
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,519
it's really hard everywhere depending on

845
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,259
what your city uses for its own Pest

846
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,659
Management or if like you're in an

847
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,820
agricultural Valley like us where you

848
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,379
have all these big crops of grapes

849
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,119
almonds all this other stuff around

850
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,039
bringing in all these other types of

851
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,300
bugs too it's it's wild to try to deal

852
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:38,579
with we have wineries here yeah yeah

853
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,019
they bring in all kinds of crap right I

854
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,480
bet

855
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:45,239
one other thing that I'd like to talk

856
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,760
about is with pests I've noticed that um

857
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,578
some cultivars have a natural pest

858
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,339
resistance not a complete resistance but

859
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:55,560
where you know I've had plants side by

860
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:57,960
side where one was covered in aphids and

861
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,639
one wasn't and they're literally three

862
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,820
feet away from each other where you know

863
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,019
they should have and uh a collective

864
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,359
like

865
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:08,159
um a collective comparison that I've

866
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:12,179
noticed between them is a lot of them

867
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:15,299
have peppery cushy like uh carphenoline

868
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:17,519
they have that that potent pepper kind

869
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,260
of smell to them and that those plants

870
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,358
like the the living dead girl that has

871
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,820
the pck in it

872
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,759
um it was very peppery and those plants

873
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,359
had little to no pest intrusion on them

874
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:33,060
whatsoever that's interesting

875
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:36,059
do you think that you can only know

876
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,980
which plants will do well by actually

877
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:41,779
trying them out

878
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,780
in your in your particular environment

879
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,920
I think you think you get a good

880
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,400
baseline from seeing other people's

881
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,039
outdoor grow but it the Expressions will

882
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,420
be the Expressions will vary depending

883
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,420
on your specific environment

884
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:01,619
this is I put up a picture of the Green

885
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,140
Lace Wing just so people can see and

886
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,838
it's a larval form I think it's on Rice

887
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,549
halls or something yeah what great color

888
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:10,920
yeah

889
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:13,140
[Music]

890
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,000
um just randomlying because Matt you

891
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:17,098
asked me about land mammals in New

892
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,039
Zealand so just a bit of trivia uh New

893
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:22,559
Zealand uh historically actually has no

894
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:27,179
native land mammals

895
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,739
um what apart from bats so

896
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:31,578
um humans introduced the first land

897
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,959
mammals to the country I think maybe

898
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:37,200
seven eight hundred years ago and those

899
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,139
are rats and then later on we got

900
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,118
um pasta weasel Stokes

901
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:44,460
I believe you guys got access steer and

902
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,619
some sort of goat as well yeah we've got

903
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,139
goat India now as well yeah so but

904
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,700
before before humans uh they were only

905
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:52,759
nice Birds

906
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,759
um

907
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,338
so yeah it makes sense that rats would

908
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,079
have been one of the first because of

909
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:59,759
the ships and the cargo ships and in

910
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,079
different pests and mammals that got

911
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,359
aboard that way

912
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,099
yeah yeah and uh you know unfortunately

913
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,858
I cannot speak to Growing Outdoors here

914
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:10,559
so uh maybe in the future someone could

915
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:12,119
but yeah that's not me for now I mean we

916
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,358
could basically ask in Australian same

917
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,700
[ __ ] right they have oh man no they're

918
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,858
creatures

919
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:22,199
they're a different vibe I just we need

920
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:25,440
to get you telling you you're an Aussie

921
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,419
yeah I know it's easy right um we need

922
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,679
to get booze on we need to get booze on

923
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,900
at some point

924
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:33,659
um right

925
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,920
right okay

926
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:37,500
um is there anything else that y'all

927
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,000
wanted to say about piss in your outdoor

928
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,900
gross

929
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,900
what I will say

930
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,780
yes not so

931
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,759
um

932
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,380
no there's not much more that I mean

933
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,960
most of the pests that we encounter

934
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,760
Outdoors we we kind of went over so I

935
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,358
got a question in this in this room real

936
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,820
quick if you could pick maybe two things

937
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,980
from your toolbox that you think that

938
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,579
are just essential for outdoor growing

939
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,320
for pests for IPM what are the two

940
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,000
things that you would

941
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,180
um advise people to at least take a look

942
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,179
at

943
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,420
uh to cushion the Giants first

944
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,460
um the the two things that I mentioned

945
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,800
the diatomaceous earth the food grade

946
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,679
specifically so you're not causing any

947
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,000
issues with your plant consumption and

948
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,399
um the other one is using natural

949
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,980
methods ladybugs Green Lace Wings using

950
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,740
uh nematodes using natural Predators

951
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,420
because they're essentially going to do

952
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,239
more work than you can with your hands

953
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:43,079
and they're better at it so yeah yeah

954
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:45,598
excellent how about you Dee uh two two

955
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,019
things I'm not without is uh Avid and

956
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,019
forbid

957
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:56,720
hey you can't forget equal 20 too

958
00:39:52,559 --> 00:40:01,139
that's the third most data uh BT yeah

959
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:03,899
green one and the caterpillar yeah that

960
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:05,879
handles most of my problems yeah leaving

961
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,059
your bowls of water so they're

962
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,420
comfortable bowls of water yes those

963
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:14,699
water for the wood rats

964
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,159
you know um those cabbage Loopers too

965
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:18,179
out here are just nightmarish there's no

966
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,500
time I can get away with the grow

967
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:21,419
without seeing those they're always the

968
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,838
first thing to attack my plants Savage

969
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,838
Loopers

970
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:31,460
and it gets hot down by you

971
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:31,460
111 something today

972
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:38,519
okay right well I wanted to move on to I

973
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,379
don't know just for fun a bit of drama

974
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:44,099
like what about human piss

975
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,079
tweakers

976
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:49,079
Denali we have to deal with many human

977
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,079
pests Tweakers tweakers do you have any

978
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,640
good stories yeah I do I have one for

979
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,560
Denali that you can mention there was a

980
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:57,299
tweaker that got him to take oh never

981
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,880
mind take care of his veg Garden for a

982
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,980
while but nevermind

but uh

986
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,699
[Music]

987
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,020
no I I I was I was ripped off my first

988
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:16,139
year I grew

989
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:19,739
and I think I went Maybe

990
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:20,940
38 39 years and never got ripped off and

991
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,219
uh

992
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:27,539
somebody came in and ripped my one plan

993
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:29,879
off I remember that p91 yeah and it was

994
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:32,159
coming down that night uh but I believe

995
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,500
that was my neighbor across the street

996
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,199
as uh normally he'd get something from

997
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,639
me at Christmas and that Christmas he

998
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:43,559
didn't oh you bastard yeah so I I truly

999
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:47,159
believe it was his kids they've shot me

1000
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,179
and he went for the p91 bro yeah oh yeah

1001
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,319
yeah

1002
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:52,019
so look

1003
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,838
good that year too I bet very proud of

1004
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:57,900
it yeah that's a good one Could you um

1005
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:01,858
look him in the eye after that uh yeah

1006
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,099
yeah I had no problem yeah but he uh he

1007
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:07,380
he got a little fidgety

1008
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:10,140
yeah they probably moved uh three months

1009
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,960
later yeah

1010
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:15,598
yeah yeah nobody is

1011
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,079
yeah we'll get to him later John does

1012
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,579
not allow this yeah the bad thing is is

1013
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,000
uh the house straight across street

1014
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:26,880
two-story it's a rental as far as

1015
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,420
weekends so they're like everybody knew

1016
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,440
all the time coming in there yeah yeah

1017
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:36,720
but nobody mess with me nobody in there

1018
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,579
it's not do you I mean despite not

1019
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,379
having too many experiences in that

1020
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,019
context do you take any precautions

1021
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:48,660
about those things I I highly recommend

1022
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:51,300
bungee sticks and Claymores yep online

1023
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:53,219
and then like those those things where

1024
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,200
you you you know you dig a hole in the

1025
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,719
ground you put spikes in them then cover

1026
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,699
pitfall trap yeah those are really

1027
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:00,779
really really effective smear poop on

1028
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,818
the spikes yeah absolutely yeah

1029
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:07,140
absolutely watch a home alone for more

1030
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:09,179
inspiration I was thinking more Yellow

1031
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:12,000
Jackets those little girls got wild with

1032
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,338
the spikes oh yeah I'll let them grow if

1033
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
they start in a plant I'll let them make

1034
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:17,059
their little Hive in there and

1035
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,039
everything else

1036
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:21,480
not to stick my hand in there I saw that

1037
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,579
picture yesterday of the yellow jackets

1038
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,380
up in there yeah

1039
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,180
yeah okay so now he's talking about

1040
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,220
literal Yellow Jackets yes Matt's

1041
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,719

1043
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,679
yesterday of wasps in his garden but I

1044
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,139
touched him

1045
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,000
yeah they're uh I'm not sure if they're

1046
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:42,059
yellow jackets or Hornets I know I got

1047
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,420
hit eight times one year oh my God yeah

1048
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:47,578
oh God I remember Andrea he told me I

1049
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,300
needed to hang uh fish hooks right at

1050
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:53,519
eye level treble

1051
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,359
I like that I like that idea Andrew's

1052
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,539
brutal

1053
00:43:54,358 --> 00:44:00,358
oh God it would be shout out to Indra we

1054
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:02,099
miss him yeah we do we do I definitely

1055
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,460
miss you

1056
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:07,740
how about you Kush human piss

1057
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,760
um so the spot that I'm at it's pretty

1058
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:10,739
rural

1059
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,380
um The Little Valley that it's in so if

1060
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:15,959
a person's trespassing they know they're

1061
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,960
on private property and thankfully I

1062
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,460
haven't had any issues with people

1063
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,720
um you know rando's showing up looking

1064
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,019
through the garden

1065
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:27,239
but um we I still take precautions I

1066
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,519
have trail cameras set up I uh I check

1067
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:31,679
the dirt to and from the grow every day

1068
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,838
for Footprints if you know well I'm also

1069
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,460
checking for game sign but you know

1070
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,078
you're always taking precautions to make

1071
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,858
sure you're the only one in and out of

1072
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,900
there

1073
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:42,000
um and other than that the really the

1074
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,280
only people that we're worried about up

1075
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,239
here is helicopters looking for your

1076
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,819
grow

1077
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:50,459
um something on the mountain that we've

1078
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,380
kind of noticed is they'll check out

1079
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,139
everybody's Grove from the helicopter

1080
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,660
but they only bust people who have like

1081
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:59,940
a hundred plants or more or if you have

1082
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:01,679
the type of property that looks like

1083
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,059
they can make some money from the Civil

1084
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,098
forfeiture

1085
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:06,900
um

1086
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:09,539
we've seen the helicopters fly through

1087
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,880
and then the next day the bus go off and

1088
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:16,858
it's generally only the people who have

1089
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:19,800
like 300 400 500 plants it's so and it's

1090
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:22,559
weird with our County too they flip-flop

1091
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,359
voting every year one year it's legal to

1092
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,400
grow outdoors one year it's not legal

1093
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,338
and everybody on the mountain who's

1094
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,460
doing like me 10 12 plants we just grow

1095
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:35,179
it anyways and you know expect the worst

1096
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,179
or best to happen

1097
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:41,480
I use baby monitors

1098
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:41,480
and uh um

1099
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,280
anybody who's used trellis knows how bad

1100
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,679
that is if you get it in your feet

1101
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,560
and I'll put a bunch of that out on my

1102
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,139
back deck with some Coke cans tied to it

1103
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,880
and uh yeah you can't walk through that

1104
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:58,920
trellis and not get your foot hung in

1105
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,519
that [ __ ] at night dark you're not gonna

1106
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,960
be having no damn flashlight going yeah

1107
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,059
so yeah there's little things you can do

1108
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,400
and one thing I know since we're all in

1109
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:10,019
California none of us would ever own a

1110
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,139
weapon to protect ourselves that's for

1111
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,139
sure

1112
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,200
I've never heard of one nope nope

1113
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,179
is that a paintball gun would be good

1114
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,739
yeah I bet it would but we would never

1115
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,858
even own one because it looks too close

1116
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,419
too what about a Super Soaker too close

1117
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:29,219
to a real one probably get us killed

1118
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,900
it's just one of those things in in

1119
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:34,500
California where actually the United

1120
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,838
States where they make it kind of extra

1121
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,179
charges if you get caught with any kind

1122
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,980
of weapon despite the fact that they

1123
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:43,858
know that like indoor Growers are

1124
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:46,079
targets for being robbed

1125
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:48,000
um probably needing you know outdoor

1126
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,519
indoor doesn't really matter yeah you

1127
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,838
know um uh and they need to be able to

1128
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,460
protect themselves probably more than

1129
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,259
most other home businesses being with

1130
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,838
their businesses and they actually make

1131
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:59,819
it illegal for you to do so

1132
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,639
at least in California you have to sign

1133
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:05,519
paperwork saying that you do not grow

1134
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,960
yeah when purchasing a firearm

1135
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,338
I see

1136
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,358
okay

1137
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:11,699
well

1138
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,980
if you all are happy to move on from

1139
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,899
this topic I thought another one that's

1140
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,699
like really fundamental probably you you

1141
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:21,059
two take it for granted more or less by

1142
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,098
now but I do want to ask about uh like

1143
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:27,000
your vidging window your flowering

1144
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:29,338
window how you strategize around that

1145
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,619
um Denali do you want to start

1146
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:32,460
well I pretty much let the sun do all

1147
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,920
the work

1148
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:38,639
you know and uh them plants are going to

1149
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,680
flower when they want to flower and

1150
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,219
you just run them out till they start

1151
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,379
but generally that's in uh August

1152
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,358
you know you might get a few that uh

1153
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,300
earning flowers in July

1154
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:53,880
but uh then it depends on the plant

1155
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,740
you know some you take that 10 weeks and

1156
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,818
if you if you get that window of

1157
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,818
opportunity with the weather

1158
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:04,619
some of them you that are shorter they

1159
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,480
get taken in September but I would say

1160
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:08,480
the majority uh in October

1161
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,139
yeah a kind of a general rule of thumb

1162
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,759
that my brother taught me and pretty

1163
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:18,239
much what I noticed a lot of The Growers

1164
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,280
go by is outdoors by Mother's Day get

1165
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,019
your plants Outdoors by Mother's Day if

1166
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,099
you want to get like a six or an eight

1167
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:28,980
foot tall plant and generally August 1st

1168
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:31,318
is when we would expect stretch and and

1169
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,000
the initial signs of flower to come and

1170
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:34,639
that's kind of for pretty much everybody

1171
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,280
that I talked to in Northern California

1172
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:40,019
that's a pretty Baseline statement that

1173
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,760
I hear from most people

1174
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:44,759
um I personally don't do Mother's Day

1175
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,599
anymore I do June 1st because I've had

1176
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,940
days before where snow dropped and I had

1177
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,460
plants outdoors and I was like well [ __ ]

1178
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,559
you know I don't I got little seedlings

1179
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,380
getting drowned out by snow in late

1180
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:00,599
spring snowstorms that hit randomly so

1181
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,460
now I wait a little bit later and I go

1182
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,539
Outdoors on June 1st

1183
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:09,059
and I usually put 12 to 14 inch tall

1184
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:11,279
seedlings out expecting something

1185
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:13,799
between the six and the eight or nine

1186
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,599
foot range which is about the size of

1187
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,839
plant that I prefer working on I don't

1188
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,780
like when they get much bigger than that

1189
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,679
yeah I go in much later than you

1190
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,800
um

1191
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,419
with Tweakers and things like that you

1192
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,940
you can't grow an eight foot nine foot

1193
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,838
plant here you have to have it below the

1194
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,519
fence right and I've tied them down

1195
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,338
and um

1196
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:41,900
attempt below the fence but I generally

1197
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:41,900
don't go in until July

1198
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:48,318
just so they don't get so big and I

1199
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,599
personally think a smaller plant

1200
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:55,440
might be better I hate to say that but I

1201
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:58,200
I do than them giant plans

1202
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,300
right some of my dwarf plants some years

1203
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,399
where I grow and a plant will dwarf out

1204
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,980
and it'll only go for it but like the

1205
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,079
snow S1 from last year one of my

1206
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,599
smallest plants one of the most potent

1207
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,480
hardest hitting longest lasting smokes

1208
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,359
out of the 14 13 cultivars that I grew

1209
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,880
and it was a little dwarf thing that was

1210
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,619
no different than the other plants that

1211
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,099
were all 12 to 14 inches when they went

1212
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,099
Outdoors

1213
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:27,480
yeah I don't I know there's talk about

1214
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:30,300
how smaller plants will produce more

1215
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,099
resin the energy is all focused on a

1216
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,220
much smaller structure so it gives it

1217
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:37,260
more more benefits but I've never done

1218
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:39,779
the test personally myself I'd love to

1219
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,700
take a cutting of the same plant and

1220
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,800
grow a big one on a small one and side

1221
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:47,279
by side and test them that'd be a really

1222
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,280
fun project yeah

1223
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,440
yeah cool I mean anything else on like

1224
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:53,940
plant size that you guys wanted to throw

1225
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,260
in there since that's like an

1226
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,260
interesting little topic

1227
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,639
this uh you know plant size is

1228
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,618
interesting sometimes like some some

1229
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,239
plants that I think will not have a long

1230
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:07,140
stretch phase end up stretching like

1231
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:08,459
crazy

1232
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,259
um you know you never really know with

1233
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,780
some of these plants

1234
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,220
um and something else that I think we

1235
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,519
kind of touched on earlier is like

1236
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:21,379
selecting the specific cultivars for

1237
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:24,300
your environment over the years I've

1238
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:27,000
unconsciously lean towards Afghani

1239
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:30,000
genetics and I realized that where I'm

1240
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,338
growing is very similar to high altitude

1241
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,760
Afghanistan if you look at photos and

1242
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:37,980
videos it's High Desert Pine with red

1243
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,740
clay soil and that's exactly where I

1244
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:44,460
live and I noticed a relationship

1245
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:46,618
between the Afghani cultivars that just

1246
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,720
basically grew themselves in my

1247
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,818
environment and I kept leaning towards

1248
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,838
them naturally because they they perform

1249
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:53,838
the best in my area

1250
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:58,739
yeah so often you know it's about

1251
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,900
finding good fit right that's like a

1252
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:03,299
general principle I imagine of growing

1253
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,980
Outdoors finding the right plants to fit

1254
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,359
your environment as well right

1255
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:11,639
absolutely

1256
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:14,940
I think two better plants I ever grew it

1257
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:17,818
was in 82 and I was uh living in the

1258
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:21,119
fifth wheel and in a trailer park and I

1259
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:23,519
put up a eight by ten little uh you know

1260
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,760
those Sears storage sheds you know with

1261
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,980
the metal doors and uh put up the

1262
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:33,599
fiberglass Roofing on it

1263
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:36,719
and uh buddy and I uh started these nine

1264
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,838
plants in there and uh

1265
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,818
uh they grew and it was one that just

1266
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:44,338
stayed super short it didn't probably

1267
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:46,858
get three feet tall but these other ones

1268
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:49,318
you know hell they're up against the top

1269
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:52,440
of the roof and you can perfectly see a

1270
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:56,039
cannabis leaf and uh so that wasn't

1271
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,838
gonna work so I went to the uh

1272
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,699
Sporting Goods store and bought all

1273
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,759
these you know one two

1274
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:05,879
ounce lead sinkers and uh Bishops uh

1275
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,980
snelled Bishops and I put these weights

1276
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,500
on them and that's how I kept all these

1277
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,659
plants in that eight by ten storage shed

1278
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,000
bent over and not touching the top was

1279
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:17,460
with weights and sinkers and then after

1280
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,079
they butted and that God what a mess it

1281
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,358
was with all that weights and sinkers

1282
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,519
banging into your hooking and stuff like

1283
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,880
this oh my God two glands that came out

1284
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:30,539
of there no and one of them is super

1285
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,460
short didn't grow very big bushy uh but

1286
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:34,739
it smelled just like seven up and it

1287
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,740
tasted just like seven of them

1288
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:40,139
and uh then there was this one that grew

1289
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:42,838
and it grew really weird it grew like a

1290
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:44,759
rose you know with the leaves there

1291
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:48,058
wasn't a lot of hairs on it do you

1292
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,740
remember what it was no no these are all

1293
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:53,880
seeds that would just get out of bags

1294
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:56,279
gotcha you know and uh yeah but I've

1295
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,579
seen it grown I've seen that rose petal

1296
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,319
like what I call it uh one time in

1297
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:04,800
Spring Valley and I was probably five

1298
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:06,420
years ago and I didn't see it till it

1299
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,859
was damn near ready to cut and I

1300
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,858
probably should have took it cutting and

1301
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:14,940
just you know we vegged it something to

1302
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:17,098
try uh to uh get it to grow when they

1303
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,858
say Rose are you talking about Bud

1304
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,960
formation or Leaf formation uh yeah it's

1305
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:25,078
Leaf it's actually Leaf formation okay

1306
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,300
the leaf comes around interesting the

1307
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,400
way that's it I think Urkel can do that

1308
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,460
sometimes poodle nuts has some look like

1309
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,960
that too yeah it can Rose top or flower

1310
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,659
top almost

1311
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,539
yeah it was raining it was weird very

1312
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:42,058
weird but it was strong and it was uh

1313
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:43,380
super crystally and sticky

1314
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,960
nice

1315
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,460
yeah well this is actually touching on

1316
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,400
the question no one could get to anyway

1317
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:53,699
which is about what have some of uh your

1318
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,680
favorite plants been to grow outdoors

1319
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:58,460
denial you can you can keep going for

1320
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:01,818
sure of orange

1321
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:06,619
yeah what what what about it

1322
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:06,619
what about it do you like uh

1323
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:12,359
it's got a crazy difference amount at

1324
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:15,180
least uh one I have

1325
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:18,539
um got a crazy difference now it's um

1326
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,980
got a great high as far for me you know

1327
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:22,679
and

1328
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,240
weeds of you know subjectable I guess it

1329
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:26,159
would be you know might not get you as

1330
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,500
high as it doesn't mean

1331
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,779
but um I don't know man that's the one

1332
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,940
that like I think everybody like pretty

1333
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:37,280
much agrees that it's as strong as chemd

1334
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,280
or close to it like no ceiling type eye

1335
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,338
that's OD too I bet you do that's just

1336
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,339
tasty

1337
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:56,759
so both of those plans do well Outdoors

1338
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:58,920
for you Denali yeah they do they do yes

1339
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,400
um is there anything about them you

1340
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:05,940
think that lends them to that is it the

1341
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:09,019
structure is it you know what is it uh I

1342
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,019
might give more loving

1343
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,338
that's true uh so it's because you like

1344
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,159
them more that like you pamper them more

1345
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:19,019
of course yeah of course yeah there's

1346
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:21,539
always some in the garden that that are

1347
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:24,539
that way for sure for me at least I

1348
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:27,058
gotta say I I think nacho very much for

1349
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:30,440
uh sharing that with me yeah for

1350
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:32,700
slipping you the D yeah yeah

1351
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,079
you're what one of two people in our

1352
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:39,379
group he's ever passed something to you

1353
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,380
are the Don Don uh d-a-w-n

1354
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,240
yeah how about you

1355
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,960
dinner so

1356
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,300
yeah over the years

1357
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,800
um it's definitely a personal taste and

1358
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,260
I think it's from like a nostalgic

1359
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,818
purpose too because the first weed that

1360
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,220
I smoked that got me really really

1361
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:00,420
really high was my brother's Bubba Kush

1362
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:03,179
and

1363
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,818
from then on out it just set kind of

1364
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:08,699
like a precedent and I I noticed in my

1365
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:12,000
outdoor Gardens continually the first

1366
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:14,578
bag to go or the first jar to go is

1367
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,980
something that leans OG like I would

1368
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:18,480
grow a plethora of stuff and over the

1369
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,679
years

1370
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,539
um just the the White Fire OG Fire OG

1371
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:29,219
Tahoe Skywalker

1372
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:31,920
candy cush Larry OG the orange kush the

1373
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:34,618
Obama kush the dosey doe like all of

1374
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,858
this stuff for me personally just it

1375
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:38,818
hits my favorite stuff and a big part of

1376
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:40,980
that is

1377
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:42,838
um just just nice pain relief

1378
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,240
um I think there's something in the OG

1379
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,318
that has great

1380
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:49,078
um

1381
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,519
inflammation it helps with inflammation

1382
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:52,559
I think it has a great amount of

1383
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:53,460
anti-inflammatory to it it just it helps

1384
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,579
me with

1385
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:58,139
everything when I smoke in OG so one

1386
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:00,180
thing with OG that I've noticed like

1387
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:02,519
looking at test results

1388
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:04,799
um and it has the same effect for me too

1389
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:06,719
even with anti-anxiety I don't normally

1390
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,160
get anxiety with ogs despite the high

1391
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,719
potency

1392
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,058
um is that they're both super high in

1393
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,799
mercine like really high even though

1394
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:15,119
it's totally different smells

1395
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,039
um and I know there's more components

1396
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,960
obviously in OG than just nursing but

1397
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,779
they both like blueberry immersing or

1398
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,159
blueberry and OG test super high for

1399
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,079
Mercy right I always thought that was

1400
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,199
interesting for the pain relief and

1401
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:29,539
positive aspects yeah

1402
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:32,460
yeah

1403
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:34,500
no you go sorry I was I was just gonna

1404
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,619
say like the pain relief is probably one

1405
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,420
of my main uh one of my main goals that

1406
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:41,700
I'm looking for in some of the cultivars

1407
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,500
um I do a lot of outdoor activities and

1408
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:45,298
I'm a bit overweight so it doesn't wear

1409
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,099
and tear on my body so at the end of the

1410
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:49,739
day I'm looking to smoke something that

1411
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:51,599
[ __ ] that takes away all the pain that

1412
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:52,979
that I accumulated throughout the day

1413
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,180
doing [ __ ] I probably shouldn't have

1414
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,179
yeah for sure

1415
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:03,719
growing was a resin's uh gut yeah the

1416
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,000
kush yeah I really like growing that one

1417
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,798
too yeah that you that that does really

1418
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,559
well outdoor with you like the Terps

1419
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:15,838
everything it's just loud yeah the first

1420
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:18,019
only plant I uh uh reversed wow yeah it

1421
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:20,759
was your uh with your spray that's right

1422
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:22,679
reversed it got balls and then they were

1423
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,359
getting real close and I cut the

1424
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:26,039
branches down

1425
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:26,900
yeah you were just test traversing it

1426
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:29,579
right

1427
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,119
I just wanted to see if I could do it if

1428
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:34,859
I can do it is do it

1429
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:37,559
right there that's it you definitely can

1430
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:39,358
yeah

1431
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,920
um I just want to ask of course so you

1432
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,199
mentioned that you like those plants for

1433
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,579
you know various reasons uh pain relief

1434
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,858
one of them

1435
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:49,318
um are there any features of those

1436
00:59:46,858 --> 00:59:51,179
plants you think that lend themselves to

1437
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:53,039
Growing Outdoors well

1438
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:55,739
here

1439
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,659
um yeah stocky structure

1440
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:59,759
um uh they hold up their own weight I

1441
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:01,259
don't have to tie up many branches

1442
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,599
um they don't

1443
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,160
they don't have a structure where I'm

1444
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,780
worried about

1445
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:09,779
um their weight causing issues with them

1446
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:12,420
which is a lot of the issues in late

1447
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,280
season with my with my setup and how big

1448
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,298
my plants are is how I'm going to

1449
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,819
support

1450
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:20,639
um weak armed or weak branched plants

1451
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:22,980
and with those ogs and those hybrids

1452
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,358
they gen they basically grow themselves

1453
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,119
I don't have to do a whole lot of

1454
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,980
external work to them

1455
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,480
that's cool

1456
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,059
um because my segue was actually going

1457
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,338
to be into plant training and with their

1458
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:38,579
e like either of you have to do much

1459
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:41,279
training on your outdoor Appliance

1460
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:43,619
very very subjective between the

1461
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,960
cultivars some you have to tie up every

1462
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:48,539
Branch some I don't have to tie up a

1463
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,880
branch at all some plants like last year

1464
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:53,940
I had the Albert Walker to the bubble

1465
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,039
gum she was so heavily weighted down and

1466
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,980
had such spindly branches that I did a

1467
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:01,440
secondary outer cage and tied them to

1468
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,059
that cage as well without that support

1469
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,880
every Branch would have literally just

1470
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:08,280
snapped at the first inch or two of snow

1471
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,160
um yeah it's very very subjective

1472
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:14,220
between cultivars um

1473
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:16,440
yeah I would agree with that

1474
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:18,179
yeah there's some you don't need to some

1475
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,119
years they get really involved and I'll

1476
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:23,818
pound stakes in and I'll run trellis two

1477
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,280
links you know yeah two things to Trail

1478
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:28,279
us through it and trellis is such a pain

1479
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,079
in the ass when you go to take it off

1480
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,059
one thing you didn't mention was using

1481
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,640
um trellis for caterpillars

1482
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:37,700
oh oh the bird netting that's what it is

1483
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:39,838
yeah yeah talk about that real quick

1484
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:42,358
yeah uh

1485
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:44,880
which is uh one year I happen to have

1486
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:46,980
put it over my vegetable garden and I've

1487
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,940
seen uh one of them cabbage Moss bounce

1488
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:53,880
off of it and I said well [ __ ]

1489
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:56,400
a pain in the ass but I'll put that bird

1490
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,440
ending over my plants and

1491
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,480
as long as you keep it where there's no

1492
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,179
holes you're great if one gets in there

1493
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,420
he can't get out yeah it just bounces

1494
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:08,460
around but uh no it works it's Flawless

1495
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,760
they don't get through that is amazing

1496
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:12,539
that's such good Tech it really is

1497
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,520
caterpillars then you don't have to

1498
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,079
worry about any spraying or anything

1499
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:18,559
else yeah

1500
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,559
please

1501
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:24,179
yeah that was good that was good then

1502
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,338
with uh that trellis yeah I I had never

1503
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:28,199
seen that before but that that really

1504
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:30,298
really uh shocked me that the the

1505
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:32,639
caterpillars actually or the the moths

1506
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:34,619
bounce off or whatever's going on yeah

1507
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,659
like are the holes just too small for

1508
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:39,539
them to enter and then I think they're

1509
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:41,399
like five eighths gotcha I think they're

1510
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:43,259
yeah they're pretty small and you know

1511
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,460
with those wings out yeah they're not

1512
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:52,020
right but the biggest pieces I've found

1513
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:53,338
you know locally was uh like 28 by 28 so

1514
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:55,559
I'd have to put a couple of them

1515
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:57,298
together yeah

1516
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:01,500
yeah they seemed to work well though

1517
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:03,119
yeah it does if you can do that yeah

1518
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,980
and like you said it's a pain in the ass

1519
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,539
to get the trellis out once you're

1520
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:09,119
harvesting sometimes right oh yeah

1521
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:11,880
everything going through it

1522
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,640
you know we generally all uh lollipop

1523
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:19,220
everything yeah they were nothing on the

1524
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,219
bottom just tops coming up yeah

1525
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,818
I want to loop back for a sec onto back

1526
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:25,500
to your favorite plants for just for a

1527
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:28,619
moment because I remembered one more

1528
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:31,318
thing I want to uh switches

1529
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:32,640
um have you two gotten the chance to try

1530
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:35,699
the same

1531
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,420
you know clones cultivars

1532
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:39,118
um

1533
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,480
both the in like indoor grown versus

1534
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,980
outdoor grown

1535
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,460
sorry those are quite a garbled question

1536
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:48,960
but I think yeah a couple of the stuff

1537
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,280
that I've played around with indoors we

1538
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,818
ran Outdoors

1539
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:56,819
um I did a Cindy 99 cut that leaned

1540
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:59,519
pineapple and it performed really great

1541
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:02,579
indoors and and tasted really amazing

1542
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:05,400
but when we grew it Outdoors she lost a

1543
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:07,380
lot of her pineapple turbs and she she

1544
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,260
didn't hold up structure very well for

1545
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:13,079
out for a big outdoor plant

1546
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,880
um same thing with the ATF but

1547
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,740
um the Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] performed

1548
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,380
better Outdoors than it did indoors in

1549
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:20,699
my opinion it uh yeah I think it did a

1550
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:23,640
lot better Outdoors than it did on the

1551
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:25,739
indoors what was your um I always ask

1552
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,239
people this and they mentioned Alaskan

1553
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:29,219
butterfly or matineeska Valley Thunder

1554
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,318
[ __ ] in your experience what did it

1555
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:32,459
taste and smell like

1556
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:35,219
um a unique

1557
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:38,760
unique blend of anise like this weird

1558
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:42,000
yeah this it's like anus is a part of it

1559
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:44,280
but the other part of it is almost a

1560
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,679
chemically something that's hard like I

1561
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,920
don't have the palette or the exact uh

1562
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:52,318
impact smell to to describe it perfectly

1563
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,838
but it was memory doesn't exist for it

1564
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:56,759
right right yeah but I would I would say

1565
01:04:54,838 --> 01:05:00,179
it somewhere in between like chemical

1566
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:03,359
and and some one of the volatiles um

1567
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:04,798
like a stringent aprid ooh Akron akron's

1568
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,000
perfect there you go I would say

1569
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:07,920
accurate yeah

1570
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,619
perfect yeah that's interesting because

1571
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,440
I re even with uh old dudes from Alaska

1572
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:16,019
rarely do I ever see two people describe

1573
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,358
uh Alaskan [ __ ] the same way so I

1574
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:20,219
always ask when I hear it yeah I just I

1575
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:23,279
just got it from a dispensary in like

1576
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:26,159
2012. I have no clue about the I just

1577
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,680
remember the brightest orangest hairs

1578
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:31,558
I've ever seen on a green bud with like

1579
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:32,879
perfect triangular buds like when you

1580
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:34,859
would trim them up you could just roll

1581
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,240
the bud in your hand and hold it and

1582
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:37,980
just cut with the scissors perfectly

1583
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,959
this is oh that's nice perfect

1584
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:42,179
triangular bug formation

1585
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,039
I love that makes it easy especially

1586
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:46,078
when it's uniform from the top to the

1587
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,298
bottom I love those cush genetics where

1588
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,119
it's like golf ball nugs from the top to

1589
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:52,739
the bottom yeah yeah it's my favorite

1590
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,358
structure

1591
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:56,818
I think that's one of the only things I

1592
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:59,400
like about cookies is how easy it is to

1593
01:05:56,818 --> 01:06:02,639
trim yeah

1594
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,559
I uh uh senior thinking you know about

1595
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,858
the question of uh

1596
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,480
uh my favorite plant and I just started

1597
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:12,119
thinking of one after another after

1598
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,599
another but uh as far as lay them out

1599
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:18,298
right yeah let's hear them

1600
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:20,640
God it was the chamba back in 80. I

1601
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:23,460
remember just you know although done

1602
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:27,118
growing plants right yeah Thai stick

1603
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:29,159
that was if I if I could go back and

1604
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,140
have one thing it would be one of them

1605
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:32,179
Killer's Thai sticks

1606
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:35,699
um

1607
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:36,598
yeah that was actually we use a one-hit

1608
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:40,259
Bowl

1609
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:42,420
that was it and that's all just a little

1610
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,260
Snapper and it would be enough huh oh

1611
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:45,720
yeah

1612
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:48,059
yeah I mean we may as well you may as

1613
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:49,558
well tell us uh about the chamber since

1614
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:52,980
we're here

1615
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:55,260
that was uh uh I got transferred and I

1616
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,838
have to be in Bakersfield working at

1617
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:00,660
Bakersfield substation uh right next to

1618
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:03,838
the old ice plant yeah the ice house

1619
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:06,480
yeah the ice house and uh that was 19.

1620
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,798
this before Matt was born

1621
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,798
oh yeah

1622
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:14,099
what year was it 1980 yeah I wouldn't

1623
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:16,139
have been born yet yeah I was 81.

1624
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:20,039
but uh the

1625
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:21,900
guy lived in uh you know the place where

1626
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:24,960
we work everybody's being transferred

1627
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:28,019
from different places and uh there was a

1628
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,179
few guys that lived over Santa Cruz area

1629
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:31,318
and he brought this stuff over before

1630
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:34,318
Christmas

1631
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:37,159
and that's what he called it Jamba and

1632

1643
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:07,858
they would just kill her butt and it was

1644
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:10,318
uh

1645
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:14,038
triangular it looked like Christmas tree

1646
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:16,679
it's exactly with about that green color

1647
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:18,838
and uh they weren't stiff and hard buds

1648
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:23,039
but they were just nice compact buds

1649
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:24,359
yeah and uh uh that's it you don't

1650
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,399
remember anything about this I know it's

1651
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:29,160
so long to ask about smell or any of

1652
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:32,338
that stuff any of that stick it had a

1653
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:35,639
sweet smell okay it wouldn't uh you know

1654
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:38,100
a harsh smell at all I remember that but

1655
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,440
uh yeah just take a small hit and it

1656
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:44,100
would expand it would blow your lungs up

1657
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:45,838
yeah yeah my older brother uh uh that

1658

negative experience if it's if it's bad

you know in thinking about these plants

1768
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,520
that you grew both indoor and outdoor uh

1769
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:49,500
what were some of the main differences

1770
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,040
that you saw in the indoor Expressions

1771
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:55,560
versus The Outdoor ones uh Clockwork I

1772
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:58,198
don't get as much uh uh resin in that as

1773
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,039
I did indoors

1774
01:13:58,198 --> 01:14:03,658
um

1775
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:06,238
a ripe area lost so uh that's not around

1776
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:08,399
but uh both of them were uh they grew

1777
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:11,339
different they look different

1778
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:14,099
than the ones that I had indoors I've

1779
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:19,199
grown one of the one of the guys plants

1780
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:20,520
it was uh q36 yeah and uh I grew you

1781
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,979
know put it outside

1782
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,480
and when I send him a picture he said

1783
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:27,119
what's that

1784
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,559
and I said that's your q36 he said

1785
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:30,059
you're kidding it doesn't look anything

1786
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,480
like it

1787
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:37,320
and it just didn't how did it do outdoor

1788
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:41,099
what's that how did q36 fare outdoor

1789
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:44,340
uh it was good it was it was it was I I

1790
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:48,239
thought it was fruity myself or tropical

1791
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:51,119
did it mold a lot uh no it did not wow

1792
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:54,319
yeah because it is a dense plant I have

1793
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:56,760
a uh a picture with the

1794
01:14:54,319 --> 01:15:00,238
q36 and the D

1795
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,560
and uh beautiful picture again both of

1796
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,139
them look great

1797
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:06,239
but uh these you've done indoor and out

1798
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,840
yeah by now

1799
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:14,819
no

1800
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:17,340
I uh uh you know since uh our friend was

1801
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:20,519
around and had departed that's right

1802
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:23,760
I've just been uh I haven't uh really

1803
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:30,840
floured anything I tried to do uh

1804
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:30,840
done I forget some some local uh

1805
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:37,880
some local would grow what is that Zohar

1806
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:41,339
or something like that

1807
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:43,739
yeah something like apple fritter or

1808
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:47,420
something like that Apple [ __ ] yeah

1809
01:15:43,738 --> 01:15:49,919
yeah and uh I did it in indoors in a tan

1810
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:52,980
and uh air conditioning went out in the

1811
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,760
house and it just cooked it yeah I bet

1812
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,779
it really booked it

1813
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,060
that plant does not have a lot of

1814
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:03,000
resistance we're learning a lot about it

1815
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:06,179
uh I haven't flowered anything I plan on

1816
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,179
it uh

1817
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,039
coming up you're gonna have to do chompa

1818
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:13,920
indoor yeah I'm gonna have to bring

1819
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:16,198
zombie indoors yeah is probably what I'm

1820
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,539
gonna have to do that's a long flower is

1821
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:23,419
it the one from pack yeah yeah that's a

1822
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:23,420
long flowering [ __ ] yeah it's 19 weeks

1823
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:31,079
you're wild yeah yeah it probably will

1824
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,820
it probably will reverse uh see if I

1825
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,260
just get some mail pollen and maybe hit

1826
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:37,279
it with something a little shorter

1827
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:41,340
that's smart hit some of those afghanis

1828
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:43,859
stuff like that short squats

1829
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,560
but uh very cool

1830
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:49,799
that's in the works but no I I want to

1831
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:52,320
uh run indoors although I suck running

1832
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,640
indoors I'd much rather run Outdoors

1833
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:54,238
myself

1834
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,579
um

1835
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,859
uh it's pretty cool to be able to walk

1836
01:16:56,579 --> 01:17:00,779
in and have that you know when they're

1837
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:05,960
flowering and the smell in there and

1838
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:05,960
that yeah it is a beautiful smell yeah

1839
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:11,219
well I got a couple more practical

1840
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:13,559
questions for you too

1841
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:15,619
um one I actually got to talk to Kush of

1842
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:19,320
the Giants a little bit about beforehand

1843
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:21,179
but I wanted to hear uh again the story

1844
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:22,738
so

1845
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:24,658
um what are your considerations well

1846
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:27,238
okay sorry first of all do you all grow

1847
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:29,339
in containers or like bags or are you

1848
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:31,559
going in the ground and what are your

1849
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:33,119
considerations slash experiences around

1850
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,539
you know growing in the ground versus

1851
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:39,658
growing in containers or bags Outdoors

1852
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:42,600
Kush do you want to start first yeah

1853
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:46,439
um so I currently grow mostly in 65

1854
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:49,739
gallon fabric pots and it's uh generally

1855
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:51,178
for ease of access uh if I had my

1856
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:55,079
preference they would all be in the

1857
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:57,359
ground but the the property is

1858
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:59,819
continually being worked on

1859
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:01,979
um cleared for fire danger and I've had

1860
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:04,619
to move my little man's Anita patch

1861
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:06,299
three times now so

1862
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:08,340
um

1863
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,300
yeah it's um

1864
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:11,300
what was the question again

1865
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,260
um

1866
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:20,340
containers versus being in the ground

1867
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:22,800
what are your considerations yeah so

1868
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:25,679
um and and in previous years I would

1869
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,480
take the containers and bring them all

1870
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,658
up to the top of the plot and mix my

1871
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:33,359
soil up there and and so it was easier

1872
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:35,519
to keep things contained in the soil uh

1873
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:39,539
in these fabric pots

1874
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:41,400
um this year I experimented and dug a

1875
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:45,060
hole in the ground where I found an old

1876
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:47,039
petrified stump and um the the new spot

1877
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:51,300
that I cut out of the patch this year

1878
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:52,439
I'm feeling is more permanent um and I'm

1879
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,600
probably going to be doing a lot more

1880
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:58,619
holes in the ground rather than the 65

1881
01:18:54,600 --> 01:19:01,260
gallon fabric pots the the 65 gallons

1882
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:04,679
are kind of restraining and constricting

1883
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:07,560
some of the plants natural want to to to

1884
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:11,279
grow a bigger root system

1885
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:13,800
so I I do like the pots for their

1886
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,759
accessibility the being able to move

1887
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,100
them

1888
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,900
um is really nice especially when you're

1889
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,980
not in growing in the same exact area

1890
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:22,139
every year

1891
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:24,259
but uh I would much rather prefer the

1892
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:24,260
ground

1893
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:31,440
fascinating thank you how about you

1894
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:34,139
Denali I uh I I use used to grow in uh

1895
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:36,419
100 gallon pot then I personally thought

1896
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:38,940
that wasn't uh I didn't need to use that

1897
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,380
much soil and all that other stuff that

1898
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:41,519
I could still grow plenty big enough

1899
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:44,159
plant

1900
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:48,360
and then I dropped to 65s and right now

1901
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:49,679
I'm at 30s and with me planting late

1902
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:51,359
um

1903
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:55,079
um like I said my plants just don't get

1904
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:58,380
that big but I've always used uh

1905
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:02,719
fabric pots were at least now and what

1906
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:02,719
the last eight ten years and uh

1907
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,760
hey I find them uh better much better

1908
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:11,639
than plastic

1909
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:15,860
uh plastic you hit the Sun hits it and

1910
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,860
it just it cooks that side of it

1911
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,779
I leave my train of thought you'll

1912
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:24,199
always win from one of these days you

1913
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:26,880
guys all do this

1914
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:30,619
dude it just happened to me five minutes

1915
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,179
ago I think I'm the youngest person here

1916
01:20:30,619 --> 01:20:34,859
you know it happens to everyone it's

1917
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:38,100
normal

1918
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:40,259
right now um what about growing in the

1919
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,980
grounds I would much rather grow in the

1920
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,320
ground

1921
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:46,559
yeah absolutely yeah some of the best

1922
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:49,380
plants I Grew From my uncles uh in early

1923
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:54,360
2000 and we had dug right in the ground

1924
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:57,900
where his dad had his own worm beds and

1925
01:20:54,359 --> 01:21:00,119
uh out on an acre of land and uh that

1926
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:02,460
was just Prime soil and they grew so

1927
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,079
nice I bet you know there's one thing

1928
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,460
that I do know the only thing I know

1929
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,738
about outdoor that I've learned from

1930
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,600
other people that that I didn't know

1931
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:11,698
because I you know growing indoor and

1932
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,159
pots you don't really learn this is that

1933
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:16,019
cannabis plants like to grow about what

1934
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,299
two what a foot and a half two feet deep

1935
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,520
and then go outwards yeah is that

1936
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:24,800
correct yeah they prefer yeah they

1937
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,800
prefer the the horizontal growth yeah

1938
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:32,158
as wide as they are going to be as Bush

1939
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:35,460
wise is that correct too

1940
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:38,819
roughly it it changes for some like last

1941
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:43,500
year that Puro G Kush Kim dog Irene

1942
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:45,380
hybrid was like 400 500 wider than the

1943
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:49,020
65 gallon pot

1944
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:50,760
wow the yeah the logistics behind it

1945
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:52,800
when I look at the photo I'm like I

1946
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,619
don't understand how that big of a plant

1947
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,739
came out of a 65 gallon pot but in

1948
01:21:55,619 --> 01:22:01,140
general most most plants like to stay

1949
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:03,718
within the curbed area that their their

1950
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:05,880
Roots unless you train them or purposely

1951
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:07,439
pull them out but a general rule of

1952
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,779
thumb is yeah they like to stay around

1953
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,479
the diameter of the pot yeah because I

1954
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:14,279
always wondered

1955
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:16,799
deeper like what if you dug six feet

1956
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:18,479
deep and and I think the CSI was telling

1957
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,619
me no they they like it's kind of

1958
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,079
pointless at that point because they

1959
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:25,140
like spread outwards so going super deep

1960
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:27,300
doesn't do as well yeah yeah there's a

1961
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:29,460
there's some dudes like uh Nuggie Nick

1962
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,860
and there's a couple other IG cats they

1963
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:35,100
have just two by fours it's not even two

1964
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:37,500
feet tall and it's it's like a a 10 by

1965
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:39,600
10 box with less than a foot and a half

1966
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:43,260
of soil and they're growing 20 foot tall

1967
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:46,820
plants yeah the plants are

1968
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,820
super healthy super happy

1969
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,960
I just wanted to ask Denali

1970
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:53,579
um because he mentioned that he would he

1971
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,859
would prefer to grow in the ground so

1972
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:57,658
are your considerations growing in pots

1973
01:22:55,859 --> 01:22:59,279
the same as Kush of the Giants like are

1974
01:22:57,658 --> 01:23:01,319
you doing it because it's just more

1975
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:04,079
convenient more accessible security

1976
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:06,198
reasons yeah

1977
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,198
um

1978
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:15,420
yeah the fact that I actually thought

1979
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:18,719
about having come in somebody come in

1980
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:23,039
and trench it you know just long strips

1981
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:25,800
yeah uh but uh it's just so easy with

1982
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:28,079
those uh fabric plots you know and if

1983
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:30,420
you need to you can move them you know

1984
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,420
that's a consideration you know because

1985
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:35,520
we red flagged here you know you got

1986
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:37,560
five days to get your [ __ ] out yeah

1987
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,760
you're in the ground you just might as

1988
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:41,100
well cut them

1989
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,199
yeah you're not gonna get them

1990
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,300
at least in pots you might have a chance

1991
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:46,979
yeah

1992
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:49,619
yeah that's another big consideration

1993
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:52,019
why I'm not in the ground completely my

1994
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:55,738
substrate is lithothide clay and

1995
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:58,920
volcanic rock it takes me an hour or two

1996
01:23:55,738 --> 01:24:01,738
to get an inch down like it and it's not

1997
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,960
shoveling it's pickaxe work it's I might

1998
01:24:01,738 --> 01:24:07,500
pickaxe it apart and then shovel out the

1999
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,420
rubble so you live in concrete basically

2000
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,579
yeah and the only this is why you didn't

2001
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:13,679
want to play Minecraft with us right

2002
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,658
yeah play Minecraft in real life play

2003
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:20,000
Minecraft at home yeah you'd rather play

2004
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:20,000
The Quarry anyways super meta

2005
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:25,079
that's really cool okay no thanks you

2006
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,000
know that was a good Insight on both of

2007
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:28,158
you thank you

2008
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,539
um

2009
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:33,000
there's a lot this is kind of like the

2010
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:35,158
last prac like quite practical question

2011
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,899
that I've got before it opens up a bit

2012
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:40,619
so

2013
01:24:36,899 --> 01:24:43,439
um how do y'all feed slash amend

2014
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:46,519
Janelle you want to go first girl I have

2015
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,519
a big old big old Barrel

2016
01:24:47,939 --> 01:24:54,238
on what I'm using you know some years

2017
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:56,520
I've gone and done bottles and liquid

2018
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:59,279
formula and then pH it and all that

2019
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:02,280
other stuff and I have to be open barrel

2020
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,779
and put a pump down in it and I'll rub

2021
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,119
water out to the plants or the garden

2022
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:08,279
hose uh

2023
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:11,939
they haven't just used it to dry

2024
01:25:08,279 --> 01:25:13,800
Amendment and Nature's Pride and they

2025
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:16,198
have a grow and they have a bloom and

2026
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,820
it's real easy and it doesn't Clump up

2027
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:18,539
and stuff

2028
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:22,039
um

2029
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:22,039
as far as amendments

2030
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:28,800
I've used uh

2031
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:32,819
Happy Frog and Seed green I believe it

2032
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:36,140
is and mix them too and then I'll add

2033
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:38,719
other stuff to it Vu Blends and uh

2034
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:42,840
just other nutrients a bunch of stuff

2035
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:45,420
insect grass and all that kind of stuff

2036
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,640
I watched Caleb enough and seen he'll

2037
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:51,079
put out what he puts in his stuff you

2038
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,079
know you just have to catch the post

2039
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:56,399
uh Matthew muted

2040
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:58,198
okay I have two different mute buttons

2041
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,059
so I have to check yeah no he's very

2042
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:02,279
transparent about that it's uh it's very

2043
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:04,080
nice it's helped me a lot too when I'm

2044
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:06,238
learning about organic growing um

2045
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,738
because I've never grown that way in my

2046
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:09,779
life I've always been a bottle person

2047
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:11,099
and you know it's nice to be able to

2048
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:14,300
brush up on that stuff when someone

2049
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,300
actually knows it real well

2050
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:20,100
yeah he's honest you know yeah he just

2051
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:23,159
didn't realize man he's a good dude he's

2052
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,440
like you man you know he's just a good

2053
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:27,299
dude well like a lot of people don't

2054
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:30,238
know you're one of the reasons me and

2055
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:32,699
Caleb ever even became friends like

2056
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,500
Denali was the the link between that him

2057
01:26:32,698 --> 01:26:36,599
and Resident along both

2058
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,319
um kind of pushed us together to to be

2059
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,320
more collaborative

2060
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,100
yeah I appreciate that I don't take no

2061
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:49,319
credit for nothing

2062
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:50,579
[Laughter]

2063
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:51,840
um how about you because of the Giants

2064
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:52,439
feeding

2065
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,440
um

2066
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:57,059
yeah so for me personally what works

2067
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:57,658
really well for me

2068
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,539
um

2069
01:26:57,658 --> 01:27:03,960
my when I when I pile all my soil up

2070
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:07,679
together it's around 650 or 700 gallons

2071
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:09,480
of soil and every three or four years I

2072
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:12,060
refresh it with

2073
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:16,198
um slow slow breakdown amendments I do

2074
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:19,800
uh 50 pound bag of blood meal bone meal

2075
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:22,279
kelp meal alfalfa meal crab meal and a

2076
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,699
30 pound bag of humic acid

2077
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:30,539
and then all through veg I'm essentially

2078
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:32,638
just adding water and uh if the plants

2079
01:27:30,539 --> 01:27:34,198
are showing that they want more nitrogen

2080
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,319
or if there's not enough readily

2081
01:27:34,198 --> 01:27:41,698
available nutrients then I will Brew

2082
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:45,119
some activated aerated compost teas to

2083
01:27:41,698 --> 01:27:49,738
to spike to spike some nitrogen and get

2084
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:52,198
things uh heated back up in the soil and

2085
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:54,419
with the size of plants that I grow I

2086
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:56,519
noticed that yeah about every two or

2087
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:58,560
three years they they suck those pots

2088
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,659
dry and and deplete pretty much

2089
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:04,580
everything out of them the the ladies

2090
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:04,579
fade pretty hard in a lot of my photos

2091
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:10,079
and if I need more than that if I need

2092
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:12,840
more than the activated aerated compost

2093
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:16,198
teas on top of the the pre-amendments in

2094
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,600
the soil sometimes I will Top dress with

2095
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:21,658
a pellet a chicken [ __ ] pellet I use

2096
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:25,620
only one type it's from Nutra Rich

2097
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:27,359
um it's like a four two two chicken

2098
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:29,039
pellets a really hard pellet and when

2099
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:30,899
you scatter it across the top of your

2100
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:33,479
soil and water it down it breaks down in

2101
01:28:30,899 --> 01:28:35,279
tight of a muddy slur

2102
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:38,459
um and beyond that

2103
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:39,960
um in flower if I notice some liming up

2104
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:42,658
a little bit or asking for some more

2105
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,000
nutrients I'll go to something like uh

2106
01:28:42,658 --> 01:28:49,138
the Gaia Green Earth

2107
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:52,079
um the flowering stuff some Maxi or some

2108
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:54,179
Earth Juice and I'll I'll do very little

2109
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:57,119
amounts of that if the plants are asking

2110
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:59,158
for it but generally most the mostly

2111
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,920
just having the soil pre-amended and

2112
01:28:59,158 --> 01:29:05,719
doing the activated compost teas does

2113
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,719
does plenty of work on these plants

2114
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:09,359
nice

2115
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:10,800
okay

2116
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:14,759
um anything anyone else wanted to say

2117
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:17,579
about feeding amending foliage anyone

2118
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:20,280
yeah I I like you know from Kush

2119
01:29:17,579 --> 01:29:22,939
how often do you look down on the tops

2120
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:22,939
of your plants

2121
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:28,079
well right around August uh I'm stopped

2122
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:29,460
being able to look over them they're the

2123
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,100
ones looking over me right now

2124
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:34,139
especially Matt's blue resin Kush oh my

2125
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:36,780
God man how big is she now

2126
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:37,619
yeah I want to say 10 but I could be

2127
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:39,840
wrong

2128
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:41,460
um maybe the top top spear is ten yeah

2129
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,679
like I'm gonna have to get on a ladder

2130
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,359
to get I'm gonna have to get on a ladder

2131
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:48,060
do they make ladders bigger than you

2132
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:50,039
yeah yeah

2133
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:52,080
there's some contractor ladders that

2134
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:55,439
I'll have to [ __ ] bring down there

2135
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:57,539
yeah dude that that lady man the she's

2136
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:59,460
she's just doing all sorts of things

2137
01:29:57,539 --> 01:30:01,500
that I like and I did not expect her to

2138
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,840
express in in the way that she did

2139
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,579
that's awesome but uh I'm happy that

2140
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,500
she's she's going for the sky right now

2141
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:09,619
I think she's the tallest out of

2142
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:13,020
everybody right now that's so wild

2143
01:30:09,619 --> 01:30:14,639
Afghani blueberry right right with the

2144
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,440
with the fan leaves I think you saw the

2145
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,300
post I did just the other day that those

2146
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:20,339
two families those things the Legacy fan

2147
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,739
Leafs on the second and third node yeah

2148
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:25,079
insane how big those are yeah that's

2149
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:26,759
wild it reminds me of the balochis or

2150
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:30,119
whatever it was it had the big [ __ ]

2151
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:33,300
yeah right prehistoric some yeah

2152
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:35,039
Jurassic Fern style stuff yeah yeah the

2153
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,199
Kush used in that was the one that

2154
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:40,738
Denali was referring to earlier it came

2155
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:42,238
from our buddy resin lung and it was the

2156
01:30:40,738 --> 01:30:43,919
one that his crew had held since they

2157
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:45,839
were running the old you know Mansions

2158
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,760
back in the day in La pushing OG cush

2159
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,460
out of the Mansions so that's where that

2160
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,500
came from and um everything in that blue

2161
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:54,658
resin Kush is testing super high like

2162
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,880
three percent Plus in in Terps but up to

2163
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:59,759
like seven you know like crazy numbers

2164
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,800
so I'm really really interested to see

2165
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,659
what she does outdoor yeah she smells

2166
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,360
wonderful right now just like sweet

2167
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:09,198
sweet Citrus blueberry oh that's nice

2168
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:09,198
yeah

2169
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,399
okay

2170
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:16,440
so if nothing else I have a couple of

2171
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,799
like more open-ended questions to round

2172
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:21,599
out uh our conversation today

2173
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,840
um Matt also wants to leave a bit of

2174
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,880
time for a little review at the end that

2175
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,500
you you too can join us

2176
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,560
um witnessing

2177
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:34,738
um so okay the first open question is I

2178
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,020
wanted to hear about uh your kind of

2179
01:31:34,738 --> 01:31:38,698
worst experiences Outdoors partly

2180
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:42,659
because it's entertaining partly because

2181
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:44,879
it's also informative for other people

2182
01:31:42,658 --> 01:31:46,439
um Denali do you I mean we mentioned

2183
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,260
pests earlier and some stories around

2184
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:51,299
that um do you have anything comes to

2185
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:52,860
mind when I say worst experiences

2186
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:55,460
Outdoors

2187
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:55,460
ah

2188
01:31:56,279 --> 01:32:02,279
I guess when I found out uh

2189
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:03,440
uh across the street uh her uh son was a

2190
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:09,380
sheriff

2191
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:13,738
and uh this is uh this is a no Grow Zone

2192
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:14,639
and so yeah so he's a uh Sheriff here in

2193
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:18,718
the county

2194
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:20,940
and I met him and I was really worried

2195
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,279
he was going to tell me you know yeah I

2196
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:24,779
can't do this you can't do every year I

2197
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:26,698
was worried about he was going to change

2198
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:30,359
because he kept going up in the ranks

2199
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:31,859
yeah uh he never bothered me but I

2200
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:35,519
worried about that

2201
01:32:31,859 --> 01:32:39,238
worry about that a lot I bet yeah yeah

2202
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,580
yeah that sucks yeah you never know like

2203
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:42,959
which way cops are gonna go especially

2204
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:44,639
with their neighbors you just don't know

2205
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,800
some of them will be growing right next

2206
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:50,279
to you and you know arresting people

2207
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:53,279
during their day job it's wild up there

2208
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:55,340
yeah there's a guy that had one of these

2209
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:59,939
dispensaries that they deliver in that

2210
01:32:55,340 --> 01:33:02,779
and he he was the ex head monkey mug of

2211
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:05,158
the Department of fishing game Jesus

2212
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:07,979
busting busting outdoor illegal grows

2213
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:10,679
and [ __ ] yeah his guys who go out and

2214
01:33:07,979 --> 01:33:12,238
cut down uh plants and things like that

2215
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:15,600
but you know

2216
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:18,658
he's funding it yeah and he did it for

2217
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:21,239
one of the senators or something that uh

2218
01:33:18,658 --> 01:33:23,460
had the money but he could get the

2219
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:24,718
license of course he could that's why I

2220
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:26,819
[ __ ] hate politicians that's

2221
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:29,658
disgusting yeah it's super disgusting

2222
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:29,658
and it's abundant

2223
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,960
okay

2224
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:37,440
how about you Chris worst experiences

2225
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,340
um fail stories worst experiences man

2226
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:40,500
um

2227
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:42,380
honestly the the real big one comes to

2228
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:45,300
mind is uh

2229
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:47,219
topping some cultivars that should not

2230
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,940
have been topped and what it does to

2231
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:51,000
them

2232
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:54,379
uh I had it happen twice and it happened

2233
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:57,539
with the Deep chunk yeah

2234
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:58,920
yeah I topped it outdoors and then I

2235
01:33:57,539 --> 01:34:02,039
also did it with the Salmon Creek big

2236
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:05,639
bud and oh interesting it it created

2237
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:09,719
such a short stocky jungly bushy plant

2238
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:11,460
that it became a chore to every day go

2239
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:13,500
in and clean out the inner growth make

2240
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:15,300
sure she could breathe make sure she's

2241
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:17,819
literally not choking herself out

2242
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:19,800
because she's like intertwined in the

2243
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:22,259
cage and intertwined in herself yeah

2244
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:25,380
like some of my biggest fail stories

2245
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:28,079
would be like just you know treating a

2246
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:30,659
plant not letting it naturally grow and

2247
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:33,420
learning which cultivars um will do that

2248
01:34:30,658 --> 01:34:35,158
and looking for the telltale signs

2249
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:39,060
um good example of that was this year I

2250
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:41,099
popped some cream bag seed from my old

2251
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:44,699
super cropping it's a black cherry soda

2252
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:46,139
hybrid that I'm very very ensconced with

2253
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:47,879
and

2254
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:49,679
um as it's growing and as it's as it's

2255
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,020
stock is shooting up and I'm looking at

2256
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,880
this thing that's like like four inches

2257
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,920
in diameter I'm like I can't top this if

2258
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:57,060
I top this the same exact thing is going

2259
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,219
to happen that happened to the Jeep

2260
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:01,920
chunk and so I just let it naturally

2261
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:04,319
Christmas tree profile out and it's it's

2262
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,840
performing much better than if I had

2263
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,819
topped it so it was a fail but it was a

2264
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,619
lesson that later taught me to pay

2265
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:12,840
attention to these things for these

2266
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:14,359
outdoor plants that hey man don't don't

2267
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:17,219
top that that's going to be a problem

2268
01:35:14,359 --> 01:35:18,960
yeah that's a good point it does release

2269
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:21,300
certain hormones into the plant when you

2270
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:23,100
top that you know some plants will react

2271
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,719
well to you some won't you know and you

2272
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:26,579
just never know till you do it but yeah

2273
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,980
one of the key things like if you know

2274
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:32,158
like indoor if if you want to know if a

2275
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:33,839
plant outdoor will react bad if you top

2276
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:35,158
it and it goes straight up with two

2277
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,300
poles like straight up next to each

2278
01:35:35,158 --> 01:35:37,979
other it's going to be one of the ones

2279
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:40,440
that probably does not do well outdoor

2280
01:35:37,979 --> 01:35:42,359
problems yep I had the uh what is that

2281
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:44,819
big sir holy weed triangle Kush last

2282
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:47,279
year yeah I topped it and it bifurcated

2283
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:49,799
the stock and went straight up in the

2284
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:52,619
air I call Twin Towers it literally was

2285
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:57,539
funny just identical branches all the

2286
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:59,599
way up yep exactly yeah another fail was

2287
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:02,579
like uh one year I think it was 2018

2288
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:05,280
when I was growing some uh

2289
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:08,279
lemon party or maybe in 2019 I was

2290
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:10,979
growing lemon party s ones and it was

2291
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:13,139
like week two of flower week three of

2292
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:14,698
flower and I was like man I want to hit

2293
01:36:13,139 --> 01:36:17,460
these with some kelp I just thought that

2294
01:36:14,698 --> 01:36:19,198
they could use the the the Boost and I

2295
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:20,760
hit them with too much kelp and they got

2296
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:22,859
burnt and they never really recovered

2297
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,840
from that so that's that's another thing

2298
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:27,119
that I've learned is like if they're

2299
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:29,520
happy and they look okay you don't have

2300
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:31,380
to you don't have to force feed them you

2301
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,120
know sometimes yes

2302
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:34,800
sometimes with the outdoor grow just

2303
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:36,920
letting the plants be helps in a lot of

2304
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,000
situations rather than trying to over

2305
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:41,658
meticulously worry about every little

2306
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,658
thing with them

2307
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:47,579
yeah I mean that's kind of a perfect

2308
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:49,560
segue because the next question was

2309
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:53,399
going to be about

2310
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:55,320
um how have you both know like observed

2311
01:36:53,399 --> 01:36:57,059
your approach to have changed over the

2312
01:36:55,319 --> 01:36:59,759
years and obviously in talking about

2313
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:01,679
fails and all that sometimes these are

2314
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,079
going to be the turning points or the

2315
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,639
major learning points um that allow you

2316
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:06,960
to progress

2317
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:09,900
um Denali you know you've been going

2318
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:14,579
what like that's like four you know 40

2319
01:37:09,899 --> 01:37:16,799
years or so like how how do you see your

2320
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:18,658
progress or Journey as a grower and how

2321
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,679
how has your approach changed over the

2322
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:22,138
years

2323
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:24,239
uh

2324
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:25,980
I still don't think I grow very good

2325
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:29,759
weed now

2326
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:31,919
that I don't think I get like 75 I think

2327
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,060
it's always got something more to give

2328
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,920
that plant

2329
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,900
I don't know that I've ever seen a

2330
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,658
perfect grow

2331
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:41,719
um and I don't know where I'm going with

2332
01:37:39,658 --> 01:37:44,879
this

2333
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:47,100
like like how what how does your journey

2334
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:51,779
changed I mean like in the past even

2335
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:54,480
five years it was well uh god well it

2336
01:37:51,779 --> 01:37:56,639
changed immensely with the computer yeah

2337
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:59,879
okay you know there was an information

2338
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,159
back then it was a few books in that but

2339
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,480
uh

2340
01:38:01,158 --> 01:38:06,000
yeah it wasn't readily talked about

2341
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:07,919
there was nothing like this you know I

2342
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,260
didn't even when the forums came out I

2343
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,239
didn't get involved with them because I

2344
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:14,460
just thought these guys are crazy for

2345
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:17,158
talking about this stuff over this thing

2346
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:19,198
that somebody has to be listening or

2347
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:22,019
being able to you know what's going

2348
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,638
where and who's doing what and I just

2349
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,699
stayed away from it a couple times I

2350
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:32,100
logged on to him and I just was like nah

2351
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:33,899
no way but um uh so much has changed in

2352
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:36,300
all them years you know from Miracle

2353
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:38,698
Grow job all this stuff they have

2354
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:41,159
nowadays and that you know you go into

2355
01:38:38,698 --> 01:38:43,319
one of them nurseries and you better be

2356
01:38:41,158 --> 01:38:45,359
smart you better mean what you want

2357
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:47,698
because he used cars she was a shoe

2358
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:51,479
store yeah there's some for everything

2359
01:38:47,698 --> 01:38:53,099
and multiple of it yeah no

2360
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:55,019
um

2361
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,840
I still think you can grow good weed

2362
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,520
just with basic amendments I really do

2363
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:03,300
yeah um

2364
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:07,739
I I think a lot of people overthink it

2365
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:09,119
you know and uh yeah looking for that uh

2366
01:39:07,738 --> 01:39:10,678
perfect

2367
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:12,719
and uh

2368
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,779
I don't know if it's attainable I think

2369
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:18,480
this plant uh uh always has something

2370
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:19,939
more to give always a curveball

2371
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,439
yeah

2372
01:39:19,939 --> 01:39:26,698
I mean there's some they're pretty damn

2373
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:29,399
good now yeah you know but uh uh I don't

2374
01:39:26,698 --> 01:39:31,019
know I just uh so Denalis yeah denali's

2375
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:34,939
staying humble you know after 40 years

2376
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:34,940
he's still learning and yeah

2377
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:41,158
yeah I uh I forgot a lot of stuff you

2378
01:39:39,238 --> 01:39:44,579
know but I have this place here to come

2379
01:39:41,158 --> 01:39:48,179
to and uh questions and I still ask some

2380
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:50,698
basic questions yeah because these guys

2381
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:54,719
know these guys are good Growers they

2382
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:58,138
really are and uh uh anybody can't learn

2383
01:39:54,719 --> 01:40:01,319
from them well you know I don't know uh

2384
01:39:58,139 --> 01:40:04,079
I learn every day from and I really I

2385
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:06,599
really you know thank Matt for starting

2386
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:09,059
this and getting this going and

2387
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:11,579
introducing me to these guys

2388
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:15,900
um yeah

2389
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:19,619
I love you big change big change

2390
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:21,299
all right very nice how about you Kush

2391
01:40:19,619 --> 01:40:22,260
um just essentially a wholehearted

2392
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:25,739
agreement

2393
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:28,020
um just like stay humble and like over

2394
01:40:25,738 --> 01:40:31,678
the years I've I've always said that

2395
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:33,659
like cannabis next to bass fishing and

2396
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:35,279
deer hunting are three of the most

2397
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:37,679
subjective topics that I've ever

2398
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,779
encountered and everybody thinks that

2399
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:42,840
their way is the right way to do it and

2400
01:40:39,779 --> 01:40:45,899
that's an empirical fact and I've found

2401
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:48,900
my success by taking the subjectivity

2402
01:40:45,899 --> 01:40:50,519
out of it and and looking at people who

2403
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:52,019
are successful

2404
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:54,659
seeing that they're doing something

2405
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:56,280
different than me trying that method and

2406
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:58,079
if it works for my garden then I

2407
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:00,658
continue to apply it if it doesn't then

2408
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:02,460
I don't apply it to my garden and I've

2409
01:41:00,658 --> 01:41:05,519
been doing that since day one with an

2410
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:07,380
open mind and I feel like that's

2411
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,260
probably the best way to tackle it is

2412
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:11,639
just always always think that you know

2413
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:14,880
you're probably there's something more

2414
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:17,579
that you could be doing because it is so

2415
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,440
in depth and it is so subjective I feel

2416
01:41:17,579 --> 01:41:21,359
personally I could spend lifetimes

2417
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:24,599
studying and learning about this plant

2418
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:27,719
and still come up short in considering

2419
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:30,539
myself an expert and sure I think as

2420
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:32,460
long as we keep that attitude like and

2421
01:41:30,539 --> 01:41:34,859
keep our minds open to the possibilities

2422
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:36,600
it's it's the best position that you

2423
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:40,079
could be especially for

2424
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:42,420
an outdoor grower with the X Factor of

2425
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:44,279
your environment or the the multiple X

2426
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:45,840
factors of your environment

2427
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:48,719
yeah

2428
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:51,239
yeah and and that you know comes back to

2429
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:53,100
my earlier disclaimer about

2430
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:54,718
grow information and how it's often

2431
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,380
framed on the internet

2432
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:58,139
um

2433
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:00,480
people like to pretend that they have

2434
01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:02,539
the authoritative or you know Ultimate

2435
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:05,939
Guide to whatever

2436
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:08,340
videos on YouTube I'm not an expert I am

2437
01:42:05,939 --> 01:42:11,158
not a [ __ ] expert I am a I'm a Noob

2438
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:13,739
at this dude I've been growing since

2439
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:15,238
2008 like I I don't know [ __ ] compared

2440
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:18,859
to a lot there's a lot of people who

2441
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:18,859
could be sitting here instead of me

2442
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:22,800
well I think what's important you know

2443
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,199
and what we covered today is again just

2444
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,600
exposing how diverse the approaches can

2445
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:30,479
be how diverse the environments can be

2446
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,800
and the challenges that come with them

2447
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:33,178
um and there's never going to be you

2448
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,920
know like Matt and I have been saying

2449
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:37,260
even throughout the breeding episodes

2450
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:40,139
like there's no Silver Bullet

2451
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:42,480
um you just have to

2452
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:45,420
um like Christian Denali have both Sid

2453
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:47,879
you know essentially try stuff out learn

2454
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:49,739
iterate again and keep iterating like

2455
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,739
forever because that's your dick in it

2456
01:42:49,738 --> 01:42:54,779
dial it in yeah just every year dial it

2457
01:42:52,738 --> 01:42:56,658
in it'll get better every year if you

2458
01:42:54,779 --> 01:42:58,319
pay attention

2459
01:42:56,658 --> 01:43:02,000
nice

2460
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:06,019
yeah well I mean anytime

2461
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,020
you just get a hold of me all right

2462
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:10,560
how can this fall me and you we got to

2463
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:12,780
do a double date we'll hit your Lake and

2464
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,639
then we'll hit my Lake okay and then we

2465
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:16,019
can hit the Kern River

2466
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,699
oh yeah

2467
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:19,139
all right yeah

2468
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:21,539
that's a bad

2469
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:23,579
bad it is man people people swim in that

2470
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:26,698
all the time still despite all the signs

2471
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:29,340
everywhere stay the [ __ ] out yeah at the

2472
01:43:26,698 --> 01:43:32,099
beginning of the uh uh Canyon Road

2473
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:35,520
there's a sign there with how many

2474
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:37,079
deaths there are each year yeah yeah I

2475
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,739
remember when I believe it was in the

2476
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:44,639
30s and it's in the 200 and something is

2477
01:43:40,738 --> 01:43:46,799
now oh yeah have died in that River yeah

2478
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:49,560
um we we have our our scooter rallies

2479
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,659
out right next to the river at a French

2480
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,119
Gulch Campground out there I know where

2481
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:56,519
it is yeah and each year we go out there

2482
01:43:54,118 --> 01:43:58,618
and this year it was the first time

2483
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,780
we've seen that River above like almost

2484
01:43:58,618 --> 01:44:01,979
hitting the the banks it was it was

2485
01:44:00,779 --> 01:44:04,500
insane people were worried about the

2486
01:44:01,979 --> 01:44:09,479
damn flooding and stuff so yeah Rivers

2487
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:12,658
flooded oh yeah that's bad River yeah

2488
01:44:09,479 --> 01:44:14,039
nice tangent huh you know um one of the

2489
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:16,679
things that I really want to talk about

2490
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:18,060
before we are done with Kush of the

2491
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:18,319
Giants

2492
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:21,539
um

2493
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:24,359
[Laughter]

2494
01:44:21,539 --> 01:44:26,819
is uh the cream you mentioned it very

2495
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:29,639
briefly uh right this is the breeder

2496
01:44:26,819 --> 01:44:32,158
Syndicate let's just give a brief brief

2497
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:34,199
or not even brief let's just talk about

2498
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:36,238
um your your fascination with the strain

2499
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:40,698
called black cherry soda and the cream

2500
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:43,859
absolutely yeah um so uh sometime around

2501
01:44:40,698 --> 01:44:46,799
2010 uh I had a friend from the Bay Area

2502
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:49,500
she was a breeder and she offered me

2503
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:52,500
some of her clones to try outdoors and I

2504
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:54,539
I got to try the black cherry soda and I

2505
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,760
got to try this hybrid that she just

2506
01:44:54,539 --> 01:45:00,060
called cream and it was black cherry

2507
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:04,020
soda crossed to Triple Threat and as far

2508
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:06,719
as I can research it's um sour grapes to

2509
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:09,960
Afghani to unknown

2510
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:12,179
um and the the cream really just kind of

2511
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:13,679
it was one of those things that just

2512
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:15,899
fell into your lap and you don't know

2513
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,940
what you have and how good it is until

2514
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:20,179
you lose it yeah

2515
01:45:17,939 --> 01:45:25,079
it's literally a plant that grew itself

2516
01:45:20,179 --> 01:45:27,719
it had no external needs it just it just

2517
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:30,600
did its thing in my environment very

2518
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:33,060
easily and I would have buyers that

2519
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:35,880
would buy every crumb of it it um

2520
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:38,100
they've flowered out really fast early

2521
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:41,219
in flower you'd get this beautiful like

2522
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:44,280
vanilla like strong vanilla extract

2523
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:46,439
smell and then week four or five this

2524
01:45:44,279 --> 01:45:48,359
Citrus orange would come in Mandarin

2525
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:50,839
orange where you'd get the uh you know

2526
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:53,460
the old 50 50 ice cream bars oh yeah

2527
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:54,319
that's the exact smell you would get out

2528
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:56,880
of this

2529
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:59,880
yeah just just one of my favorite

2530
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:02,659
profiles and and I think I super cropped

2531
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:06,020
that or mono cropped that from

2532
01:46:02,658 --> 01:46:10,319
2000 10 to about

2533
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:12,900
2019. it was nine years where wow I grew

2534
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:15,479
14 of those outdoor every year trying to

2535
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:17,460
get two pounds off at each plant and the

2536
01:46:15,479 --> 01:46:21,000
buyer would literally buy every crumb

2537
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:23,399
off of it it was yeah and

2538
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,439
I didn't realize because and that's the

2539
01:46:23,399 --> 01:46:28,259
other thing that's funny too is I smoked

2540
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:30,658
mostly cream during that session too not

2541
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:33,060
really I I I try stuff here and there

2542
01:46:30,658 --> 01:46:35,279
and try a single out offshoot plant in

2543
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:37,380
the garden but I was mainly smoking that

2544
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:40,559
cream just being super complacent not

2545
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:42,420
realizing that I had such a fantastic

2546
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,420
plant that I could smoke it for so long

2547
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:47,819
and not get tired of it yeah yeah and

2548
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:50,279
then the second I lost it it became

2549
01:46:47,819 --> 01:46:52,259
super apparent to me how much how how

2550
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:57,179
fantastic she was and

2551
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:59,280
yeah so so in in losing her you started

2552
01:46:57,179 --> 01:47:03,359
your journey into trying to recapture

2553
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:06,000
that in seed form yeah it got me into it

2554
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:08,519
put literally put my nose right into the

2555
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,880
to the reader Syndicate episodes about

2556
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:14,580
reversal sprays and and taking your

2557
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:17,279
lines and and you know making the the

2558
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:18,899
the generations last I I at the time

2559
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:22,738
that I had the cream I was very

2560
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:24,779
complacent just cloning re-mothering and

2561
01:47:22,738 --> 01:47:26,279
just super cropping this plant in the

2562
01:47:24,779 --> 01:47:29,880
back of my mind I was never thinking

2563
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:31,500
about propagating this plant and I did I

2564
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,480
didn't think that

2565
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:35,880
um recloning it and remothering it so

2566
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:38,459
much would cause genetic issues later

2567
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:40,079
down the line I I just it just wasn't in

2568
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:41,158
my mind it wasn't something I was paying

2569
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:46,738
attention to

2570
01:47:41,158 --> 01:47:48,420
and um yeah so it got me into uh got me

2571
01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:51,000
looking into what I should be doing as

2572
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:52,380
far as is breeding and and in case I run

2573
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,920
into something like that again in the

2574
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:59,520
future and and luckily uh I found some

2575
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:03,539
old trim I got some Bag seed of the old

2576
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:05,580
cream from 2016. and I got uh had a male

2577
01:48:03,539 --> 01:48:07,380
and a female come up this year I took

2578
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:09,359
out the mail but took clones of it all

2579
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:12,179
the Clones are rooted they're waiting I

2580
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:15,118
took clones to the female so I got this

2581
01:48:12,179 --> 01:48:17,819
this bag seed representation and yeah

2582
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:20,279
she's she's a little chunkier than what

2583
01:48:17,819 --> 01:48:21,899
I'm used to and that that would you know

2584
01:48:20,279 --> 01:48:23,880
that she's she's got a different

2585
01:48:21,899 --> 01:48:26,158
phenotypical expression a little bit but

2586
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:28,380
she has that vanilla where we're in week

2587
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:30,839
two almost you know two and a half weeks

2588
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:33,779
of flower and that vanilla it's

2589
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,460
literally emanating vanilla smells so

2590
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:37,319
I'm I'm in Nostalgia heaven right now

2591
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:39,480
with this plant

2592
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:41,399
you know two strains that I immediately

2593
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:44,339
think of when you talk about it are West

2594
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:47,339
Coast dog Which is popular up in your

2595
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:49,440
area very very much like vanilla bean

2596
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:53,100
smelling uh I believe someone renamed it

2597
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:56,279
Madagascar vanilla bean for a while and

2598
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:58,020
um agent orange Agent Orange Is Right a

2599
01:48:56,279 --> 01:49:01,139
few times I've seen a seed line that

2600
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:03,840
produced 50 50 bar terms that's a name I

2601
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:06,359
haven't heard in a while yeah yeah a PGA

2602
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,219
agent orange it was one of the people

2603
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:09,539
often confused my Clockwork Orange with

2604
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:10,920
it so people would be like oh you're the

2605
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:12,960
dudamate agent orange and I'd have to

2606
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,060
disappoint them be like no no I made the

2607
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,980
clock and they're like oh I don't know

2608
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:19,380
what that is [ __ ] that you know right

2609
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:21,779
right yeah but no it had a beautiful 50

2610
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:23,039
50 bar uh taste and smell and that's

2611
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:25,079
something that's always stood out to me

2612
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:27,420
because in the world of oranges I'm not

2613
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:30,179
a huge fan unless it is that 50 50 bar

2614
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:32,880
sweet orange green yeah it's beautiful

2615
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:35,219
yeah most of the Citrus that I run into

2616
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,859
it's not my favorite I don't find a lot

2617
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:40,439
of pure orange Citrus strong

2618
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:42,420
um as compared to Lemon Citrus or or

2619
01:49:40,439 --> 01:49:44,719
lime Citrus much much different

2620
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:48,840
different than the orange Citrus sure

2621
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:51,899
absolutely I like Cali orange you like

2622
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:53,880
the Calio I like the Calio

2623
01:49:51,899 --> 01:49:57,238
my first time I smell the guy came in

2624
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:59,219
and it just reeked and I just thought

2625
01:49:57,238 --> 01:50:01,319
that was some of the best stuff

2626
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:03,060
I have an old pack that I found from

2627
01:50:01,319 --> 01:50:06,179
Dutch Passion at California Orange you

2628
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:08,460
should pop it see if you like them

2629
01:50:06,179 --> 01:50:10,079
that's old like that I haven't had that

2630
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:12,239
in years and years and years

2631
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:13,380
any glass orange I had was your orange

2632
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:15,599
cookies

2633
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:18,480
oh yeah yeah that's right but that was

2634
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:21,000
mostly cookies dominant yeah

2635
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:23,519
that was good though that was good good

2636
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,340
you did good with that one

2637
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:29,159
my uh my buddy did the California Gold

2638
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:32,699
Rush from Caleb last year the Calio to

2639
01:50:29,158 --> 01:50:35,819
train wreck oh how was that it was a

2640
01:50:32,698 --> 01:50:38,939
monster it was an amalgamation of really

2641
01:50:35,819 --> 01:50:42,238
large Buds and just terpenolene and

2642
01:50:38,939 --> 01:50:45,359
citrus orange like yeah it it was it was

2643
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:46,919
a heady plant big buds but Airy but you

2644
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:50,519
know not not real dense

2645
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:52,500
he he made a lemon party Calio too which

2646
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:55,139
I was like oh my God that's gonna be

2647
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:56,880
almost offensively Citrus to the point

2648
01:50:55,139 --> 01:50:59,100
like lemon orange to the point where it

2649
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:02,400
might not even be smokable because it's

2650
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:04,800
so oily anybody who's after lemon Terps

2651
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:08,479
go to the lemon party

2652
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,860
um s1s everything that I popped just

2653
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:14,459
Starburst yellow

2654
01:51:10,859 --> 01:51:17,939
um uh not Bubba head the uh lemon head

2655
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:19,800
candy uh Terps were there uh and my

2656
01:51:17,939 --> 01:51:22,618
favorite was one that leaned a little

2657
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:26,699
sativa and it was like black tea and

2658
01:51:22,618 --> 01:51:29,880
lemon it was like a hashy hazy

2659
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:32,099
um tea black tea mixed in with a lemon

2660
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:34,020
like I thought like lemon black tea

2661
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:37,260
every time I smelled this plant that's

2662
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:37,260
beautiful yeah

2663
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:47,480
all righty I mean is that

2664
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:47,480
is that us before the review man

2665
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:52,460
uh yeah I guess we could do the review

2666
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:57,840
since we're talking about Lenin right

2667
01:51:52,460 --> 01:52:00,480
and recently we had it we had a person

2668
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:03,779
join our our uh

2669
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:06,118
server briefly very briefly that talked

2670
01:52:03,779 --> 01:52:08,279
about a cut called Lemon Cherry gelato

2671
01:52:06,118 --> 01:52:11,219
and he was talking about how this cut

2672
01:52:08,279 --> 01:52:15,599
just one cups it's the bomb you know the

2673
01:52:11,219 --> 01:52:18,079
the another gelato So lately I've been

2674
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:22,139
on my quest to

2675
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:24,238
update my my knowledge of current

2676
01:52:22,139 --> 01:52:25,560
availability of flower strains and

2677
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:27,839
flower form

2678
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:28,920
um in the hype Market you know strains

2679
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,380
that I normally wouldn't pay attention

2680
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,260
to or smoke I've been trying to force

2681
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:36,719
myself into learning about maybe opening

2682
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:38,579
my eyes broadening my horizons as it

2683
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,800
were to see what some of the kids were

2684
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:43,559
smoking these days so I decided Lemon

2685
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,579
Cherry gelato uh would be the the next

2686
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:47,219
choice

2687
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:50,158
and I wrote down some notes real quick

2688
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:53,399
when I was smoking it on not first the

2689
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:56,219
scent you know the flavor profile the

2690
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:58,138
high any anything like that

2691
01:52:56,219 --> 01:53:00,060
um when I get a strain called Lemon

2692
01:52:58,139 --> 01:53:01,920
Cherry that's going to be the first

2693
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:04,380
thing that I'm looking for when I smoke

2694
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,880
it or even smell the bud right what does

2695
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:08,819
it smell like does Mike lemon or cherry

2696
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:10,139
does the name infer anything

2697
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:12,840
um smelling it

2698
01:53:10,139 --> 01:53:15,900
it wasn't I mean it had a decent scent

2699
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,579
it wasn't like unscented it was um

2700
01:53:15,899 --> 01:53:20,279
I could tell that it had some kind of OG

2701
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:23,460
in it but the dominant scent was mostly

2702
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:26,399
gelato not really sweet

2703
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:27,420
um as as I in first I I smoked it with a

2704
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,719
lighter

2705
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:33,179
and I was getting from the flavors

2706
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:35,480
earthy chocolate for a second

2707
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:38,880
um some floor cleaner like OG

2708
01:53:35,479 --> 01:53:42,359
hopsy not unpleasant interesting for a

2709
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:45,000
gelato but it tasted exactly like a

2710
01:53:42,359 --> 01:53:46,679
well-grown OG Kush which from the smell

2711
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,020
I knew that would be in there I did not

2712
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:51,480
think that would be the dominant flavor

2713
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:53,400
when combusted was just like smoking a

2714
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:56,279
really good OG Kush

2715
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:59,158
um with that said there was no lemon or

2716
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:02,158
cherry of any sort combusting it for me

2717
01:53:59,158 --> 01:54:04,920
personally in this grow of it obviously

2718
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:06,179
depends who grows it how they grow it

2719
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,819
Etc

2720
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:10,440
um it did have a unique almost woodsy

2721
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:12,420
smell with a sweet earthy chocolate

2722
01:54:10,439 --> 01:54:15,178
almost like Bubba um in the background

2723
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:19,020
like how Bubba can be kind of chocolatey

2724
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:21,179
um but yeah it tasted like OG Kush

2725
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:23,100
all the way and the the most important

2726
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:26,760
part of it would be the high which

2727
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:28,619
lasted a total of 13 minutes it may be

2728
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:30,840
the

2729
01:54:28,618 --> 01:54:32,698
um the least

2730
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:34,260
length of a high because I could feel I

2731
01:54:32,698 --> 01:54:35,579
was high at first it wasn't like it

2732
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:37,860
didn't hit at all it wasn't like a

2733
01:54:35,579 --> 01:54:40,679
Blackberry Kush it was non-existent but

2734
01:54:37,859 --> 01:54:42,359
it was third I counted it like okay I

2735
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:44,219
marked it down okay I smoked right now

2736
01:54:42,359 --> 01:54:46,079
within 13 minutes it was totally gone

2737
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:48,359
and I had to smoke again so that was a

2738
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:50,639
problem that's a problem

2739
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:53,219
um so I've been sitting here with the uh

2740
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:54,480
rip you know sitting here with uh the

2741
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:55,618
rip

2742
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,479
um vapiness throughout the episode

2743
01:54:55,618 --> 01:55:00,479
because ripping it gives you a whole

2744
01:54:57,479 --> 01:55:02,459
different flavor profile all of it it

2745
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:04,079
you're getting a lot of the volatiles

2746
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:06,060
that that burn up immediately when you

2747
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:07,380
combust it you'll never taste you taste

2748
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:09,780
them this way

2749
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:10,980
um so what I wrote down during this is

2750
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:13,380
while we were doing this let's write it

2751
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:16,500
down the loudest flavor by far is the

2752
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:19,800
Lemon so whereas combusting I tasted no

2753
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:23,100
lemon nothing this tasted completely

2754
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:26,219
like lemon like all up front lemon

2755
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:29,159
um floor cleaner like like OG Kush would

2756
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:32,039
um but Extreme lemon extreme lemon so

2757
01:55:29,158 --> 01:55:34,259
the lemon name is accurate per vaping to

2758
01:55:32,039 --> 01:55:36,300
be honest um The Hive is much brighter

2759
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:38,159
clearer and more energetic I actually

2760
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:42,420
really liked the high from it

2761
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:45,000
but it lasted like 10 13 minutes

2762
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:48,179
I'm just curious at this point and uh

2763
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,279
with Denali and kush here uh do you two

2764
01:55:48,179 --> 01:55:51,779
what are your primary modes of like

2765
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:55,198
interesting like

2766
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:57,800
joints glass do you do either of you

2767
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:57,799
vape as well

2768
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,658
I like uh I like balls I like water

2769
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:07,079
filtered

2770
01:56:03,658 --> 01:56:09,179
yeah yeah I got a prototype shower head

2771
01:56:07,079 --> 01:56:11,039
glass piece that I really enjoyed i've

2772
01:56:09,179 --> 01:56:12,960
smoked out of a lot of pieces but

2773
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:14,100
nothing beats the shower head Park

2774
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,020
system

2775
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,940
nice

2776
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:19,739
I was just saying I was just gonna say

2777
01:56:17,939 --> 01:56:21,539
that like um it is interesting what

2778
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:23,039
Matt's pointing out right that vaping

2779
01:56:21,539 --> 01:56:24,960
obviously can be quite a different

2780
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:25,979
experience especially when it comes to

2781
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,340
the

2782
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:31,439
yeah smell and flavor and high high is

2783
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:34,319
so different I can't even explain to you

2784
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:37,859
how different the high is from um from

2785
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:39,960
using the rip versus combustion

2786
01:56:37,859 --> 01:56:42,118
um you know some people say that vaping

2787
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,158
doesn't get them high at all whereas I

2788
01:56:42,118 --> 01:56:44,880
think it gets me so much more

2789
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:47,779
um

2790
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:50,940
so much more high it's it's

2791
01:56:47,779 --> 01:56:51,719
way more complex way more complex of a

2792
01:56:50,939 --> 01:56:54,178
High

2793
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:56,279
um like I said the incombusting this in

2794
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:57,658
a decent high but it wasn't like um it

2795
01:56:56,279 --> 01:57:00,238
wasn't anything better than a normal

2796
01:56:57,658 --> 01:57:02,219
gelato like as far as high vaping it was

2797
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:04,019
much more energetic it was clear-headed

2798
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:06,000
but it was obviously there and it was

2799
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:07,320
pleasant kind of giggly

2800
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,939
um it's a totally different experience

2801
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:10,859
and I highly recommend everybody give

2802
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:13,678
both a try

2803
01:57:10,859 --> 01:57:16,920
yeah fascinating I don't know do we have

2804
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:19,079
a rating system yet uh do we want stars

2805
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:21,779
do we want buds do we want and how many

2806
01:57:19,079 --> 01:57:23,760
four or five where are we going guys

2807
01:57:21,779 --> 01:57:25,319
I need to start a rating system guys

2808
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:28,020
help me out

2809
01:57:25,319 --> 01:57:30,238
five stars five buds five stars yeah

2810
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:32,520
five stars you know we can think of what

2811
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:34,799
else it can be I will give this a three

2812
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:36,300
out of five because it got me high it

2813
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,840
was a decent High

2814
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:42,360
but it loses two stars for lasting 10 to

2815
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:44,819
15 minutes like I already want to dab

2816
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:47,698
some diamonds or something

2817
01:57:44,819 --> 01:57:50,039
you know what I mean like yeah so that's

2818
01:57:47,698 --> 01:57:52,799
my review on Lemon Cherry gelato the the

2819
01:57:50,039 --> 01:57:54,479
best strain ever

2820
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,800
According to some

2821
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:59,579
yeah

2822
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:02,340
uh that's cool I mean thank you both so

2823
01:57:59,579 --> 01:58:04,979
much uh for coming on the show

2824
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:07,619
um it was a really cool conversation and

2825
01:58:04,979 --> 01:58:10,500
I think we covered a lot of territory

2826
01:58:07,618 --> 01:58:12,960
um shout out to Rings poor guy he was

2827
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,300
meant to join us I think

2828
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,679
we'll take that L uh we messed up a bit

2829
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:18,300
with the coordination

2830
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:20,760
um yeah but we hope to have him on again

2831
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:22,679
I think it was clear from just talking

2832
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,360
to you both today that you know there's

2833

01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:28,979
right this may not be the last time we

2835
01:58:26,939 --> 01:58:31,738

2836
01:58:28,979 --> 01:58:33,959
