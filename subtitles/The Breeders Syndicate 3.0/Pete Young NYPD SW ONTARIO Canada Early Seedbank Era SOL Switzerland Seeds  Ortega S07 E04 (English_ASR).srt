2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,039
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,058
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,358
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,080
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,639
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,379
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,379
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,480
you'll notice with a lot of our

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,979
interviews it kind of just jumps into a

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,500
conversation and this will be no

21
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,558
different and the ending will probably

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
be no different as well so

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,099
um apologies in advance a lot of our

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,760
conversations are all over the place

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,120

26
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,739
just wanted to put that in there cheers

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,200
okay welcome to breeder Syndicate

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,600
everyone I'm Matthew I'm here with my

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,439
friend Shawnee kids and not so dog and

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,899
we are here with New York Pete

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,559
um was the I guess you would say owner

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,740
Runner of compassion clubs in the um in

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,200
the 90s in Canada correct yeah and we're

34
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,759
still going so I I started the uh

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,759
originally it was called the London

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,759
Compassion Club uh back in 95.

37
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:40,259
um and then

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,140
um we went public in with Allen Rock so

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,859
that would have been like

40
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,780
97 or so and that's um that's when I uh

41
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,578
split off from hemp nation and did the

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,519
organic traveler which was my retail but

43
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,239
they call me NYPD just because my name

44
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,938
is

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,859
Petey Pete and I'm from New York kind of

46
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,139
thing so that's uh they don't call me

47
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,759
New York Pete but they call me NYPD NYPD

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,719
yeah I'm always scared to lead with that

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,280
because I remember when the first time I

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,280
heard I was like NYPD yeah

51

you know

79
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,878
in a semi-shady you know quasi what you

80
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:23,158

quasi-legal to to gray area to maybe you

82
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:29,699
know yeah and I always said you know we

83
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,940
have uh we I've always lived in the gray

84
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,378
area of the world and sometimes it's

85
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,739
really dark gray and sometimes it's

86
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:40,018
really light gray right like you know

87
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:44,519
I've uh I've had a deal in the black

88
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,019
market because I needed to to suffice or

89
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,480
to satisfy the need of the medical

90
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:53,039
community that I was part of and I

91
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,780
couldn't grow enough for everybody so

92
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,098
um and that's really really why I

93
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,340
started growing pot I started growing

94
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:01,679
pot you know one not to sell it I just

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,140
wanted to save money and when I started

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,019
organic traveler uh in a you know

97
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,839
University Town I had the uh grow your

98
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,180
tuition Campaign which was uh I would

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,219
sell you seeds and give you information

100
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,900

106
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,219
um because money in your pocket whether

107
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,500
you save it or make it it's still money

108
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,699
in your pocket right yeah no don't get

109
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,160
into this industry and I [ __ ]

110
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,439
honestly you know I I won't work with

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,240
anybody

112
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,418
back in the day especially when cannabis

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,780
was illegal if your sole income was

114
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:47,758
strictly on growing pot

115
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:51,299
good on you you you're not going to be

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,460
in my circle because I think you know if

117
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,460
you're doing that's kind of prostituting

118
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,138
the uh the plant and I've always been a

119
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,299
good big advocate

120
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,978
about you know not prostituting this

121
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,139
plant like use it for what it's meant

122
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:08,279
for right like it was put forth for us

123
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:12,900
to enjoy not to you know uh pasteurize

124
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:15,059
and and prostitute kind of thing so I've

125
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,359
made my entire living off of cannabis

126
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,579
yes but I also had organic traveler

127

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,180

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,478
quarter ounce

167
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,759
50 bucks bring it you know but that pot

168
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,740
is there it's for you I'm not selling it

169
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,439
to anybody else right that could be a

170
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,660
generational thing too because like when

171
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,219
I I felt like where I you know where I

172
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,620
grew up at least it was really important

173
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,440
to have some kind of

174
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,720
um verifiable income yeah right because

175
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,759
you had to have some reason of existing

176
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,840
you had to have some way to make it you

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
didn't want to go to court and they're

178
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,038
like how do you support yourself and

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,979
you're like uh right and you know it

180
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,399
comes from an era where like you it had

181
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:31,439
to be a side gig because you know you

182
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,060
needed even if it was just a even if it

183
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,160
was just a front like you said like you

184
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,439
had no like organic traveler was all a

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,620
front like I mean I [ __ ] never made

186
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,120
money do at organic travel I lost it

187
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,579
when it got to a point of losing about

188
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,680
40 Grand a year I said okay we're

189
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,139
pulling the plug and now by that time

190
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,840
you know I was doing the compassion

191
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,120
Society for

192
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,939
like 20 years

193
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,418
the cops knew what I was doing you know

194
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:03,000
and then you know in Diva came into play

195
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:06,180
and Diva came in into play

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,418
as I was close and organic like I I same

197
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:13,439
thing CRA I had to read

198
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:16,978
and you you kind of need to have

199
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,439
um a reason for like you said what

200
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:21,060
people see but for me it's for what I

201
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,519
see and what I know

202
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,060
and I I cut ties with some really

203
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:29,219
[ __ ] great Growers and uh and I cut

204
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,399
ties with people that were just [ __ ]

205
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,459
[ __ ] you know and it was just

206
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,019
um their focus was money money money and

207
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,418
when you chase it

208
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:42,000
you know you're opening yourself up to

209
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,799
the you are more vulnerable to be taken

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,019
advantage of or get busted or you know

211
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,659
get Shady deal with Shady people [ __ ]

212
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:52,199
like that I've been pretty lucky I mean

213
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:57,600
what I've been in this industry

214
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:01,740
um [ __ ] long time 30 how old am I 30 40.

215
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,899
40 almost about 35 years you know that I

216
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,180
put my name out there and said hey I'm a

217
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,039
[ __ ] pot guy kind of thing yeah and

218
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,958
London London is a pretty conservative

219
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,539
place like it was completely different

220
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:15,059
than like that's why most people went to

221
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,039
BC because everybody left BC and that's

222
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,479
why I say like they'd be like oh BC

223
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,458
grows the best part of course they do

224
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
they're from Ontario like [ __ ] you know

225
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,479
like I went out to BC I lived out there

226
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,939
and I didn't meet anybody from [ __ ]

227
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,100
BC kind of thing right I've been out

228
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,600
there on grow contracts but you know it

229
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,580
was um

230
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,560
what we have here I mean it seems like

231
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,480
it it kind of

232
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,139
I think the marijuana movement started

233
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,800
around here and we are in a very uh

234
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:47,039
conservative uh town and back when I

235
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:50,579
started we had a very conservative uh

236
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,980
religious mayor and uh you know I wanted

237
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,660
to make a point I put up big banners

238
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,420
that said the Lord believes in marijuana

239
00:09:54,659 --> 00:10:00,240
do you believe in the Lord you know and

240
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:03,179
it was not something that she took

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,379
kindly but would not you know

242
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,479
um

243
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,539
make us think about it because she would

244
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,100
be giving me AirPlay but yeah more clock

245
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,838
in the morning the [ __ ] Paddy Wagon

246
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,800
showed up and took down my [ __ ]

247
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,959
Banner

248
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,699
you know and that's the thing like

249
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,679
you've been doing this a long time and

250
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,740
and all of that but like the one thing

251
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:26,939
you've been doing also is like fighting

252
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:31,080
the law openly right like since what

253
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,820
since 93 you've been constantly more

254
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,200
like I think is when the Constitutional

255
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,600
challenge yeah yeah

256
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,680
like I still talk with Alan Young uh on

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,659
a regular basis right like he's uh that

258
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,479
poor man's been beat the [ __ ] up in this

259
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:51,240
[ __ ] industry too who is he uh Alan

260
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,278
Young is the uh I say the Cannabis

261
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
lawyer in Canada so

262
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,000
um

263
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,459
um and so he's the one that handled uh

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,399
Chris's case uh his partner Paul

265
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,518

266

big doobie whatever the [ __ ] his name is

267
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,480
if you go to the West Coast you have

268
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,278
John Conroy when you hear constitutional

269
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,180
lawyers uh you're dealing with Alan

270
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,759
Young

271
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,859
do you want to explain the the whole uh

272
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:22,980
Chris Clay arrest

273
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:26,159
uh sure yeah so uh I was part of NPC but

274
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,320
in the shadows uh luckily so the first

275
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,039
time he got raided

276
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,778
um

277
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:38,338
yeah it was uh yeah so with with Chris

278
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:40,019
very educated well read polite kid who

279
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,000
didn't start smoking pot till just a few

280
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,519
years prior

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,740
um read the law and the law

282
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,240
the way that the law was read is it

283
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,220
wasn't cannabis that was illegal it was

284
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,159
THC yeah so THC is not in the seeds

285
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,079
that's correct we started selling seeds

286
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,838
and that's how I met him because I was

287
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,659
going back and forth from New York to

288
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,480
Saint Thomas or London because I was in

289
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,939
college and I was bringing seeds back

290
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,440
and forth Just trading for genetics for

291
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,720
genetics yeah

292
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,779
and so I was helping him with the the

293
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:20,100
little uh Great Canadian Emporium seed

294
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:22,320
[ __ ] company and then he realized

295
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,600
well cuttings don't have [ __ ] THC in

296
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,778
them either so he took out a [ __ ]

297
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,320
full page ad in the uh see I think we've

298
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:33,958
seen magazine that said uh overgrow your

299
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,480
government and I I'm pretty sure that

300
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,000
Chris well it would have been Andrew who

301
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,278
was the artist coined that phrase the

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,839
overgrow overgrow your government right

303
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,419
that's overgrow the government and it

304
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,820
was like it was literally a cartoon of a

305
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,159
seed marching with a helmet on with the

306
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,180
hemp Nation flag on it holding a bong at

307
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:57,860
like it's a gun and you know and we said

308
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:01,859
we're gonna sell 30 skunk one cuttings

309
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:06,060
for 30 bucks or 25 for 25 bucks or

310
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:09,419
something like that and um I think by

311
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:13,500
the seventh cutting or something along

312
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:15,419
that line uh Jordan who's the

313
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,419
little person I think is a proper name

314
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,979
Howard the Duck yeah he was Howard oh

315
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,500
that guy okay you're talking about yeah

316
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,680
so he uh I just reconnected with him too

317
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,480
he's back in Toronto and um so they read

318
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,000
he was the one that actually sold the

319
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,820
cutting to an undercover cop

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
they must have brought or the duck sold

321
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,440
the cutting to an undercover cop yeah

322
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,240
yeah that's why he was arrested right so

323
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,760
Prince was arrested because he was the

324
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,399
owner with his name on the lease yeah

325
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,980
and uh Jordan got arrested because he

326
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
was the actual one that did the um the

327
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,980

386
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,639
Cannabis and came back later that uh

387
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,379
afternoon and raided the place yeah we

of uh controlled substance or back to

394
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
econ it would be called something

395
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,919
different back then I don't know if it

396
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,578
was a PPT like the uh possession for the

397
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,979
purpose but um anyways they you know

398

cleared out the store [ __ ] made a

399
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,519
mess of it basically tried to shut them

400
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
down and

401
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,839
um maybe they didn't realize Chris had

402
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,419
really supportive parents that had money

403
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:43,259
and believed their son not to be a

404
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,919
[ __ ] criminal like he was treated and

405
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,778
um

406
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,479
and

407
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:50,939
the Elmwood house we had a grow house on

408
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,259
Elmwood that everybody lived in except

409
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,259
for me because I actually I was

410
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,039
delivering meat at the time and

411
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,560
um

412
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:01,500
and you know they went there that's

413
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,879
where they busted Prozac and uh his

414
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,019
girlfriend at the time

415
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,939
and uh that was [ __ ] a [ __ ] show of

416
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,939
craziness because as soon as the cops

417
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,500
busted us the phone calls started going

418
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,880
everybody that it was at the house was

419
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,519
literally like running to the basement

420
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,260
grabbing pots running out the backyard

421
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,418
throwing them Over The Back Fence into

422
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,578
an empty lot so by the time the police

423
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,559
got there there was literally a trail of

424
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:28,019
dirt up the stairs through the kitchen

425
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,899
out the back door and dirt still on the

426
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,160
top of the fence I bet yeah throwing it

427
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,620
over and they were just like they were

428
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,058
like yeah not on the property not our

429
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,739
problems you know so um so that that was

430
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,319
the first bust

431
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,440
and then since they didn't say anything

432
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,659
about the the seeds Chris and Chris and

433
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,798
I Chris and I got a little bit more

434
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,480
serious about it and started to um

435
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,980
um

436
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,079
get a little bit more into the breeding

437
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,360
buying like you say showing those some

438
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,038
of these early uh scent to see packs and

439
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,279

tell me that you were the first in in

443
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,599

444
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,059
first

445
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,740
uh Seed Company in Canada because I

446
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,879
didn't know of anybody else that was

447
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,660

448
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,220

456
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,000
um and then

457
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,600

um out west there was nobody really

463
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,840
out west that we knew of

464
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:07,678
uh NPC wasn't even around at this point

465
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,959
in time so as far as I knew

466
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,580
yeah Chris Chris was the first one to

467
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,200
stick his [ __ ] Little Neck out there

468
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,538
to um

469
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,080
to to spread the word right like to

470
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:22,679
overgrow the government so you know and

471
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,538
when they busted him the first time

472
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,580
they uh

473
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:30,058
they didn't do anything about the seeds

474
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:32,579
so we figured [ __ ] you know we we know

475
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,139
where the limits are so [ __ ] yeah the

476
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,119
ball to the wall let's get into the seed

477
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,100
[ __ ] business Let's Start Spreading

478
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,259
the seeds [ __ ] everywhere you know

479
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,538
and we started that's when I was hired

480
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,759
to work in the store

481
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:47,220
um and every Sunday I would do

482
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,019
um cultivation uh counseling whatever

483
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,579
the [ __ ] they wanted to call it with

484
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:56,579
NYPD yeah and uh and um

485
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:59,099
it was a uh

486
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:02,460
it was the point that you know we

487
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:05,038
started getting noticed and we would

488
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,480
start getting people traveling to us and

489
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,819
then Chris

490
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,819
got on the internet and everything back

491
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:15,298
then was raw code and started producing

492
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:17,700
the uh seed menu online

493
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,339
yeah and it was [ __ ] it we were getting

494
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,798
more hits at one point if I remember

495
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,319
correctly he said we were getting more

496
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,319
hits than University of Western Ontario

497
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:30,480
that's funny I believe it right because

498
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,700
we had so many [ __ ] people that just

499
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,740
heard what you can buy cannabis seeds

500
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,840
and then you know because we were in the

501
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,179
newspaper sure they're gonna put that in

502
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,599
it so it gives us credibility of who we

503
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:45,360
are and what we're doing yep and then uh

504
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,519
when they came back the second time they

505
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,139
offered Chris a uh

506
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,839
a

507
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:58,679
a way out an option is yeah to to

508
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,859
um plead guilty to lesser charges and

509
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,759
drop the Constitutional Challenge and

510
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:07,259
um and basically sell the seed sell the

511
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,200
pipes sell the bongs we don't care about

512
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,519
that you know and Chris came to us and

513
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,319
said it's up to you guys that I mean

514
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,759
we're we're a nation at this point in

515
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,220
time we were true we were treating

516
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,379
ourselves as a nation so we we had

517
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,759
Minister as minister of Agriculture and

518
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,080
then we had a minister of Labor which

519
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,519
was Bill that took care of all the

520
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:29,399
retail store and all the um uh all the

521
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,079
staff and then we had minister of uh

522
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,960
education which was Sarah and she took

523
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,839
care of the library and the museum and

524
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,880
uh and stuff like that and Andrew was

525
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:42,418
the Minister of Defense he was our

526
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,000
artist but he was the angriest

527
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,500
he was he just had he was he's a

528
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,480
brilliant he's a school teacher Iran

529
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,119
which scares to share with me now and

530
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,839
his wife owns from Mars which is another

531
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,879
Staple in this town and um

532
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,798
you know so we were set up as a nation

533
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,539
kind of thing we were ready like they

534
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,599
call it as War on Drugs we were going to

535
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:06,658
take it as a War on Drugs so we formed

536
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,879
our nation and we were ready and uh and

537
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,559
this is like with our early 20s kids

538
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,260
right like you're all like in your early

539
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:17,460
20s this was in the 90s still this would

540
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,599
be late 90s okay yeah so we were uh

541
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,819
um

542
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,579
yeah it would have been like mid 90s

543
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:26,819
actually second time yeah because I

544
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,879
opened up organic in 97.

545
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:31,139
and um

546
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,679
and we were all and Chris was already

547
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,720
banished from Ontario by that time

548
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,860
and the thing was is after the first

549
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
raid

550
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,639
like I said we went balls of all to the

551
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,038
with the seed and the seed uh business

552
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,480
and that's when we started again if

553
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,480
you're going through Amsterdam sell it

554
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,960
send a seed so I can breed them and I

555
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,640
was doing what um what the [ __ ] a big

556
00:22:51,960 --> 00:23:00,440
douchebag and uh Amsterdam are you on no

557
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,620
no he's he's a nice douchebag okay

558
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,058
douchebag uh so many no yeah but he's

559
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,298
the this is the most famous he

560
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:11,759
threatened to sue us as Legends for when

561
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,259
we were entering the cup with the uh he

562
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,099
thought

563
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:19,619
Neville fast no no no that never was

564
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:21,480
always uh good people but we were using

565
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:24,779
Neville seeds yeah

566
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,500
hey Hank oh yeah so

567
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:30,658
Hank is the type of [ __ ] guy that

568
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,298
started doing what we were doing but but

569
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:37,020
being a dick about it I would I would

570
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:40,200
openly say Hey listen we got in 20 seeds

571
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:42,119
of skunk one from uh from the dronkers

572
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,960
and

573
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,239
I'm open breeding those and in the same

574
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,919
room we had an original Haze we had a

575
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,859
black dominant we had all these other

576
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,538
strains so they're f1s this is what

577
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,939
you're gonna get when there's no

578
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:59,400
guarantees here but

579
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,220
you got your grown pot you know now

580
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,019
you're officially a pot grower and uh

581
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,058
they're they're good genetics they're

582
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,418
not you know from where I started my

583
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:12,119
genetic uh selection was from bags of

584
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,400
weed yeah you'd get [ __ ] and New York

585
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,899
we're not getting the [ __ ] best weed

586
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,580
we're getting [ __ ] Jamaican brick

587
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,740
like when I first started

588
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:22,319
we were buying nickel bags in East

589
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,099
Rockaway on B15 which I think is

590
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,740
actually in a Beastie Boys song but um

591
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:31,199
for five bucks for a nickel bag and 10

592
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,599
bucks for a dime bag and we would get

593
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,880
you know a third of it with seed it was

594
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,158
back when it was after people were

595
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,080
saying uh buying it by the lid right

596
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,780
there's like four fingers in a [ __ ]

597
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,298
in a sandwich bag yeah but we were

598
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:46,918
basically going and buying nickel bags

599
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,859
for

600
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,780
five bucks and you would get

601
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,099
a shitload of seeds in it and if it was

602
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,819
good pot

603
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,139
I would save the seeds right and I

604
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,700
didn't know what the [ __ ] it was I

605
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,759
didn't know what sativa was or indica

606
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,580
was I mean it's all [ __ ] Jamaican

607
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,259
[ __ ] [ __ ] weed or Colombian or or

608
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:09,538
whatever so when we got certain things

609
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,220
and people like oh it's gold

610
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,679
okay well I'm Gonna Keep the [ __ ]

611
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,480
seeds because I've heard that back in

612
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,340
the high reading in High Times magazines

613
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:23,099
so I started collecting those genetics

614
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:27,058
and I would bring them up to Canada and

615
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,879
I would trade with uh with Chris right

616
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,558
and he would have his seeds from here

617
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,020
London is a [ __ ]

618
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,639
phenomenal place for cannabis for

619
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,220
multiple reasons one because we did have

620
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,320
the Perth County conspiracy that was a

621
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,700
lot of the draft Dodgers that came to

622
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,359
Canada

623
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,000
um

624
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,519
didn't want to go too far north and

625
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,179
we're right between Buffalo and Detroit

626
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:53,220
and if you look at the uh Geographic we

627
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:56,400
are surrounded by great lakes so we are

628
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,380
a glacial runoff that all the minerals

629
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,360
and everything got deposited so our soil

630
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,360
here that's why we're such a large

631
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:06,019
farming Community our soil is [ __ ]

632
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,579
awesome was awesome

633
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:11,819
right so since we were getting all that

634
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:15,259
uh and we're all grown pot in the fields

635
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:17,538
in the [ __ ] uh in the corn you know

636
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:20,339
we were growing some great [ __ ] pot

637
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:24,900
and if you got seeds in it which you

638
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:26,639
would inevitably uh get something I was

639
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,320
happy as [ __ ] [ __ ] people like pissed

640
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,000
off like oh man it's got season I was

641
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,099
like [ __ ] give me this no that's a

642
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,960
score bro

643
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:36,480
you smell the pot is it worth keeping

644
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,019
you know yeah give me some descriptions

645
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,240
grow it out see see if I could grow it

646
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,158
indoors you know

647
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,558
um if it came from around here I knew I

648
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,020
can grow it most likely Grow It Outdoors

649
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,359
because there wasn't very many people

650
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:54,418
growing back then if they were they were

651
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,418
using phototrons and uh yeah fluorescent

652
00:26:54,419 --> 00:27:00,360
lightings and [ __ ] like that

653
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:03,840
the hid Community really wasn't taking

654
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:06,178
off uh it was in the

655
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,740
90s

656
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:14,580
in the early 90s I was having some

657
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,980
local kids go and steal [ __ ] lights

658
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:19,019
from in front of buildings yeah because

659
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,960
there were street lights or something

660
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:24,240
there were metal halides and HPS and

661
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,919
they were either 400s most likely all

662
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,740
400 there wasn't too many thousand Watts

663
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,900
back then yeah I think 250s and 400s yes

664
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,679
we were trying to

665
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,360
um

666
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,919
we were growing pot like I said we were

667
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,199
[ __ ] cockroach we didn't know what we

668
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,240
were growing how we were growing it but

669
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,798
[ __ ] man it's it's a weed they call it

670
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,319
weed for a reason the more you do to it

671
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,359
the more you can [ __ ] it up so let it do

672
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,038
its thing give it food give it water

673
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,099
give it air

674
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:53,460
she's gonna give you back so

675
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,798
um by by bringing some of these Jamaican

676
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,259
strains from New York

677
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,000
and which I'm saying Jamaican which I

678
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:05,038
think it's going to be it was it was

679
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,599
brickweed so I knew most likely I should

680
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,240
say I didn't know back then but I

681
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,278
learned quickly that you can't grow any

682
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,798
of course here right just but we can

683
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,380
grow it indoors uh people didn't like it

684
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,019
because it was too big too scraggly too

685
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,659
long you know if anything they're

686
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,298
growing up here especially all the pot

687
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:28,080
that came from the the

688
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:30,298
60s and the 70s or 60s when the draft

689
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,519
Dodgers were coming and then the 70s

690
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,740
when their kids were getting you know

691
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,960
old enough or or something that they

692
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,519
were growing dad's strains and I just

693
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,240
saw

694
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:45,000
one yeah so it's called Elmwood and it's

695
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,759
supposed to be this ancient genetic that

696
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,298
is supposed to be fire for outdoor

697
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,278
around here so I get a lot of

698
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:56,339
um

699
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:58,980
uh seeds do you know any more history on

700
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:01,439
Elmwood or is that just basically no all

701
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,200
I know is I wanted the seed forever

702
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,980
because I heard of it yeah all I knew

703
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,940
was like when you get to Northern

704
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,319
London North London Lucan Exeter you

705
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,320
know a little bit further north maybe

706
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,720
not as far as

707
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,700
um not as far as own sound but maybe

708
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,579
kind of in that direction south of

709
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,380
Collingwood Owen Sound this was the

710
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:29,099
plant that everybody grew because it was

711
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:32,940
massive interesting uh was it the the

712
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:35,819
the best don't know but you know we

713
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,080
would have people that grew like this

714
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,879
this strain is called berry berry

715
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,678
actually you know what this is berry

716
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,140
berry it's a uh and it was my first

717
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,659
centerfold in High Times oh what's in it

718
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,700
it was just a [ __ ] seed that a guy

719
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,539
came in and says this is the [ __ ]

720
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,519
bomb

721
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,480
wow all right let's let's try it out we

722
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,038
grew it out it was had to be like an F1

723
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,079
uh because it was all over the place but

724
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,940
it would [ __ ] turn into something

725
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,398
like this I was just like

726
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,380
this is [ __ ] awesome and uh they

727
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,778
didn't have a [ __ ] name for it they

728
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,640
was like us taste smells like it might

729
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:10,759
be a blueberry salad I'm not calling it

730
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,278
blueberry yeah

731
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:18,658
all right it gets the uh gets the idea

732
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:21,240
you know what happens oh good

733
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:23,220
like I was curious when did you first

734
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,140
start uh or when did you first make

735
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,899
contact with high times and start

736
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:31,259
working with High Times uh

737
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:33,239
Kyle found me

738
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:37,019
um

739
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,399
Cushman yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right I

740
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,379
like to put that out I actually sent him

741
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,479
an email because he's out in [ __ ] the

742
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,820
oakster damn [ __ ]

743
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,000
spreading the uh

744
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,778
the what does he call it now the plant

745
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,839
Chiropractics or something like that

746
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:54,538
it's super cropping right yeah and it's

747
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:57,599
an article that's was the first article

748
00:30:54,538 --> 00:31:02,220
and it was like a Grower's interview or

749
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:04,918
whatever on me yeah and I didn't make it

750
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,558
up I was shown by some growers in uh in

751
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,380
this area and I made sure it was in the

752
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,359
article saying you know it's [ __ ]

753
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,980
phenomenal technique for people that are

754
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,379
growing indoors that want to grow

755
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,079
certain trains certain ways sure and

756
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,460
don't want to have [ __ ] 50 plants you

757
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:23,220
can have

758
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,340
two plants three plants and still get

759
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,778
two pounds yeah you know not it's gonna

760
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,759
take a little bit longer but you know

761
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:32,159
certain strains obviously work better

762
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,460
for it but it's manipulating and

763
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,159
training plants uh to grow in a in a

764
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,100
certain way and um

765
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,080
and so when Kyle came through

766
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,839
so short long story short the other

767
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:48,178
thing with him teaching this is like how

768
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,558
did you learn this like I want I want I

769
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,019
don't want him to acknowledge me but I

770
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:55,678
want him to acknowledge the lineage of

771
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:59,179
the history yeah this technique sure

772
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,179
because people deserve

773
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,819
yeah yeah right especially because I

774
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,319
don't talk to either of them anymore and

775
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,298
the one guy's the biggest dick in this

776
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,178
[ __ ] town when it comes to anything

777
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:15,839
in general but he showed me this

778
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,640
technique that [ __ ] got me recognized

779
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,918
that's what they flew me to high to uh

780
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,020
the Cannabis Cup to talk about it says

781
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,600
talk about Canadian cultivation

782
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,158
techniques and it was super crappy yeah

783
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:28,500
and then they did the same thing with

784
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,940
Soma five years later or something but

785
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,659
so anyways

786
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,778
um Kyle was living in Detroit

787
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,500
at the time and

788
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:40,259
um

789
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,278
he was coming from maybe Toronto or

790
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:45,720
something

791
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,038
and I he must have heard about uh either

792
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,140
the seeds

793
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,179
or me or

794
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,759
um something can you hear that beeping

795
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,399
curiosity yes what is it like diabetic

796
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,359
thing I don't know oh it's okay and

797
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,778
um

798
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,240
and uh he just popped in the shop one

799
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:06,419
day at Organics and struck up the

800
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,019
conversation and we hit it off and then

801
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,919
um

802
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:12,418
he would come back and I would uh him

803
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,440
and his boys we called the Detroit

804
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:19,919
danksters uh great Growers back there uh

Canadian pot like the they were coming

812
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:38,880
through London and I would invite them

813
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,038

814
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,778

816
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:47,519
you're paying 200 bucks an ounce but

817
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,079

868
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:05,279
um and the gangsters

869
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:08,338
and oh God another photographer [ __ ]

870
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,119
most I think the most famous uh

871
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:13,739
photographer back in the 90s to early

872
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,800
2000s

873
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,838
God damn it he was there doing he was

874
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,300
shooting also but anyways

875
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,980
I was meeting with Kyle so I brought

876
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,200
all my photos it was right after I got

877
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,800
back from Switzerland so I had all my

878
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,078
Swiss photos I had my Amsterdam photos

879
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,740
um and I got

880
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,839
I got this in the early 2000s then

881
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,879
because you said yeah because I was in

882
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:42,059
Switzerland in 2000

883
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,320
so Switzerland didn't really get going I

884
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:45,119
don't think I was at the cup and I think

885
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,338
I did the cup in

886
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,440
no I did the cup

887
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:52,500
quit smoking pot two yeah it would be

888
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,519
two thousand we've been two thousand and

889
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,800
um

890
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,880
so when I that's what I was meeting I

891
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,119
would imagine that's what I was meeting

892
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Kyle for because I brought all my photos

893
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,099
uh which always meant pictures which I

894
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,320
just basically use as proofs and then

895
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:11,820
slides because that's what the magazine

896
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:14,820
wanted and then video because I wanted

897
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,940
to uh document

898
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,980
the shoots yeah so when they pulled me

899
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,380
and I was driving my girlfriend at the

900
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,480

and I had

903
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:32,279
crazy dreads that were probably just

904
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,920
about my shoulder length but they were

905
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,480
still just finishing developing so they

906
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,000

907
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,039

909
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,139
with any [ __ ] pot or anything like

910
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,838
that and um got pulled over

911
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:51,118
and they said you know we were searching

912
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,400

913
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,838

920
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:12,659
like no I'm dumb not stupid nothing yeah

921
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,159

922
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:16,440
okay well we're gonna search the vehicle

923
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,019
and make you stand out stand in front

924
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,539
and I watched the guy go around to the

925
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,699
back and he's a younger custom agent and

926
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,279
he holds up the first slide and you just

927
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:28,019
see his eyes go [ __ ] this big oh I

928
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,960

929
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,519

you know

932
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,880
not sure how the law is here I kind of

933
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:41,519
have an idea that you're allowed to look

934
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,858
through anything but there's people's

935
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,559
likeness in these photos that I do not

936
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:49,319
have model releases for so legally I

937
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,759
can't show them to anybody right and he

938
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,980
explained yes you're right you have

939
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,660
absolutely no [ __ ] rights here uh

940
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,838
we're allowed to look at every [ __ ]

941
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:59,039

942
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,900

943
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,820

949
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:16,399
holding cannabis and stuff like that but

950
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,720

951
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,200

952
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:26,519

maybe 10 000 photos negatives in that

954
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,179
van

955
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,338
because I brought everything yeah

956
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,338
because that was a money cow for me for

957
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:37,078
High Times they loved it they and I

958
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:38,759
didn't get paid for all the pictures a

959
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,579
lot of it came into the grow America

960
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,099
because Kyle needed photos to put in to

961
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:46,079
grow America and I say okay I'm gonna

962
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,059
donate this many but you're paying me

963
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,280
for this many right like if I got a

964
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:54,299
centerfold I got 600 bucks if they got a

965
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,400
full page I got 300 bucks [ __ ] so it uh

966
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:00,420
it made sense for me to do this so

967
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,338
anyways maybe that's you know he opened

968

981
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:31,740
from the states kind kind of thing and

982
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,539

985
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,440
why do you have all this and luckily at

986
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,239
the same weekend they were having the

987
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,940
one of their uh

988
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,799
big Rave convention party kind of thing

989
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,599
I forget what they called it they had a

990
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,820
specific name and I was like oh I was

991
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,960
coming back from there and we set up a

992
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:57,720
booth to show people to use cannabis

993
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,740
because you don't have to have it tested

994
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:03,838
for [ __ ] you know bad drugs right and

995
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:06,179
they had them at these at these concerts

996
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,679
or at these parties where if you got a

997
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:09,000
pill they would go and they'd scratch

998
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,598
off a little bit of it and they would

999
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,460
test it and say yeah it is MDMA or it's

1000
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,039
you know some at some speed or whatever

1001
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,800
they would be able to tell you

1002
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,119
um maybe not what's exactly in it but

1003
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,339
they could more or less tell you what's

1004
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,039
not in it right so I just made up that

1005
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,739
[ __ ] literally on the whim that I

1006
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:30,300
was coming from that and I had all the

1007
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,059
pictures that's just put out on display

1008
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,579

1011
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:41,039
they bought it they liked it I'd [ __ ]

1012
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,480
gave him one of my [ __ ] credit card

1013
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:49,139

1018
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,380
was one of the Techno festivals in

1019
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,440
Detroit yeah yeah and it was they were

1020
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,059
big back then

1021
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,559
I mean I wasn't trying to interrupt or

1022
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,119
anything like that but one of the one of

1023
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,338
the ways that we used to regularly go

1024
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,140
into into Canada

1025
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,480
um that um

1026
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:13,920
was we used to go like in especially in

1027
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,599
the Detroit scene with Windsor being

1028
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,358
right there there was parties that were

1029
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,160
thrown in Canada yeah right and there

1030
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,139
was a lot of border crossings well they

1031
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,358
learned like what hippies and ravers

1032
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,759
looked like and they didn't like them so

1033
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:30,059
we used to drive across the border there

1034
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,920
wearing like Dockers and polo shirts and

1035
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:33,960
all normal and all of our like real

1036
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,820
clothes were like stuffed in the trunk

1037
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,320
yeah of what we normally looked like

1038
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,480
because we were trying to go back and

1039
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,720
forth and look like the biggest nerds

1040
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,000
ever yeah right because if you you know

1041
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,559
if you looked a certain way yeah you're

1042
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,539
gonna get you're gonna get checked out

1043
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,219
on a certain level and I just didn't

1044
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:53,940
have that option I had [ __ ] dreads

1045
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:56,159
and you know like I I did the opposite I

1046
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,318
was just like I'm driving a Volkswagen

1047
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,500
bus okay I got a pot leaf on my shirt

1048
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,420
and I got [ __ ] dreads now I'm born in

1049
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,858
New York

1050
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,358
and I live in Canada so I have a

1051
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:09,420
passport for both

1052
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:11,279
they can't deny me wherever I go if I'm

1053
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,318
going to the states no matter what I

1054
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,940
look like they can't deny me because I'm

1055
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:16,920
only using my Canadian my U.S passport

1056
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,720
I'm gonna come back to Canada I'm not

1057
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,180
telling them that I have a passport for

1058
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,159
the states or vice versa I show them the

1059
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,960
[ __ ] Canadian passport right right

1060
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,578
can't deny me I know I look like

1061
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,280
somebody that you don't want to let in

1062
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,260
your country but I'm a citizen [ __ ] off

1063
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,060
you don't have a choice so it makes a

1064
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,619
big difference I like that how do you

1065
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:38,639
know you're in the States now

1066
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:42,480
yeah okay all right I mean I uh you know

1067
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:44,039
it um you know I have uh I I have I have

1068
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,440
an uncle that does the same thing he has

1069
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,380
Brazilian citizenship because and he's

1070
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,880
he's American as well and so he uh he

1071
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,740
when he goes into Brazil he uses the

1072
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,300
Brazilian when he comes back into the

1073
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:56,239
U.S he uses America so it looks like he

1074
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,579
never goes anywhere but he's yeah

1075
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:01,919
constantly you know and he just uses you

1076
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,900
know and so but yeah I just I just

1077
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,240
remember especially in the Windsor area

1078
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,940
because Detroit was right there

1079
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,279
um as as the years in the 90s went on

1080
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,139
they definitely started

1081
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,480
um you know I don't know if you want to

1082
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:17,400
like what what you know profiling if you

1083
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,740
will no you know he had an image of like

1084
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,139
what hippies looked like or what herbs

1085
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:24,179
Smugglers look like or what ravers

1086
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:25,980
looked like or you know what each one of

1087
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:28,379
these groups was likely to have on them

1088
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,199
or whatever you know so well I always I

1089
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,180
always tell people that you know I I

1090
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,179
kind of followed a certain

1091
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:41,338
mathematical equation for lack of better

1092
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,740
terms right the police know that what to

1093
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:46,559
look for right if

1094
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:52,379
um if you're in this industry

1095
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:55,159
so there's going to be uh 90 of our

1096
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,160
community

1097
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:01,979
is susceptible to getting busted because

1098
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,318
of the way they look the way they smell

1099
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,780
the way they walk or talk right sure

1100
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,779
it's five percent on either side the

1101
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,720
five percent of the people in this in

1102
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,060
the movement or industry that never

1103
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,858
leave their house they don't go to the

1104
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:18,900
grow shop themselves they send somebody

1105
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:21,539
to send somebody to go buy the

1106
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,519
fertilizer go buy their seeds go buy

1107
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:26,940
what they want and then that person

1108
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,099
whoever purchases has no idea what who

1109
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,260
the person is that place the order kind

1110
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,300
of thing that person is never going to

1111
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,700
get busted they I mean it's going to be

1112
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,260
very unlikely that they get busted and

1113
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,118
then the other five percent is where I

1114
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,220
fall in I stand on the street corner

1115
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,338
with a [ __ ] six foot pot leaf with my

1116
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:46,919
dreads out in my Volkswagen going I'm a

1117
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:49,739
[ __ ] pot guy like they don't want

1118
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,440
that they they know who I am they know

1119
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,519
what I'm doing

1120
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,619
there's ninety percent of the other

1121
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,880
people are out there are susceptible to

1122
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,980
fill their quota

1123
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,000
why the [ __ ] do we want to drag in the

1124
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,199
dreadlock who's going to have the

1125
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,539
newspapers there

1126
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,419
so they're like we'll leave him alone so

1127
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm in that five percent on the opposite

1128
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,920
side because I literally had a six foot

1129
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,960
pot leaf in my front window I literally

1130
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,599
did have pot plants growing in my front

1131
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,338
window and for a certain time my whole

1132
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,818
front window was full of [ __ ] peyote

1133
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:22,559
and San pedross and didn't you also do

1134
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:24,000
stuff like call the newspaper and they

1135
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,338
would run an article where you take them

1136
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,619
to like a corn field oh no that was a

1137
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:31,380
that was uh like CBC and [ __ ] I brought

1150
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:04,199
makes them cough it smells like

1151
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,380
strawberries whatever the [ __ ] deal

1152
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,818
was so uh Kyle was with uh HT at the

1153
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,660
time

1154
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:11,279
um

1155
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:17,219
and

1156
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:20,460
uh he met the cough guys when I was

1157
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:23,459
still hanging around with him

1158
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,559
okay um never got to meet him they were

1159
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,059
different direct I was actually I'd have

1160
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,460
worn out from my arrest in Connecticut

1161
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,440
so I wasn't going to go to Connecticut

1162
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,059
yeah there's no reason to be hanging out

1163
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,700
in Connecticut no there's no reason

1164
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,739
doing [ __ ] Connecticut

1165
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:40,799
it was a speeding ticket so yeah it was

1166
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:42,598
145 mile per hour speeding ticket so I

1167
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,760
never I never went back and I was like

1168
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,859
you know whatever but no reason told me

1169
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,220
about it and it seemed like a great

1170
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:51,719
strain now I had strawberry Diesel and I

1171
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:53,939
was like what what strawberry are they

1172
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,679
using kind of thing like you know is is

1173
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,440
did you give them my strawberry by

1174
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,858
chance like you know what what you know

1175
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,420
and I never really got down that uh I

1176
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:06,179
never went down that rabbit hole to

1177
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,338
figure out what it was but from what I

1178
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:11,759
understand from what Kyle told me he's

1179
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:14,759
just like they hit the money shot with a

1180
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,700
[ __ ] uh with a plant that produced

1181
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,400
this [ __ ] fire pot it was [ __ ]

1182
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:21,858
phenomenal and um

1183
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,358
and

1184
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:25,559
[ __ ] do you know what was in the

1185
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,818
strawberry diesel you were running at

1186
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,358
the time

1187
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:32,338
no no no just because it was that was it

1188
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,199
was brought to me as yeah because the

1189
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:36,239
the cough itself did start in

1190
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,039
Connecticut and I got introduced to it

1191
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,659
it made its way out to Colorado through

1192
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,599
people who went from Connecticut to

1193
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:44,759
Colorado yeah um Kyle has always been a

1194
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,640
little bit [ __ ] uh you know he dances

1195
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,079
around origin stories because it's like

1196
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,699
one of the things that because he worked

1197
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,519
for High Times he got pretty well known

1198
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:56,039
for you know yeah and so as he's tried

1199
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,838
to become like a can of celebrity some

1200
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:00,719
of the origin stories of the things that

1201
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,420
he's known for he's gotten pretty uh you

1202
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:06,239
know pretty vague well I mean because

1203
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,920
the [ __ ] douchebag he sold the cough

1204
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,139
to [ __ ] Hank

1205
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,780
right that's why he's the Strawberry

1206
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:15,358
Cough seed was produced yeah it's

1207
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,460
because [ __ ] and I don't know if the

1208
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,440
Connecticut boys got even a piece of it

1209
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,199
right it probably didn't

1210
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,858
um because and like when when Kyle and I

1211

to do they were all Ortega they were all

1299
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,780
big [ __ ] uh Indica freaks yeah yeah

1300
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:00,659
because they didn't [ __ ] work in the

1301
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,940
field you know red did a little bit but

1302
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:05,098
I was there for [ __ ] months you know

1303
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,079
Papa Bear came out there sat in the

1304
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,660
[ __ ] hammock smoke joints and [ __ ]

1305
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:13,079
with you know waited and thought he was

1306
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:17,818
the [ __ ] the king we uh we bred sweet

1307
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:20,880
tooth yes um strawberry blonde

1308
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:23,219
um the Louie

1309
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,240
I figured also we just basically we had

1310
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:26,239
a uh we had

1311
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,239
30 maybe 600 watts in a room

1312
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,119
mainly we're just doing cuttings because

1313
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,639
the company is called Mr hemp that Steve

1314
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:40,440
was working with and it was just it was

1315
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,858
right after they got busted for the

1316
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,639
selling pot to a minor but we still had

1317
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:51,980
the uh we sailed the facility in lagano

1318
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:55,078
and um we ended up uh just taking a mail

1319
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:57,059
and smacking it against the fan in the

1320
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,260
corner yeah it pollinated the whole like

1321
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:01,559
he couldn't barely see through the

1322
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:04,800
[ __ ] room and um so some of my seeds

1323
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:08,400
here someplace called the blonde bastard

1324
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:12,900
and the blonde bastard was uh

1325
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,160
was a strawberry blonde crossed

1326
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,099
um

1327
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:19,920
and they didn't want to do anything with

1328
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,599
it so I ended up uh keeping it

1329
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,880
let's see what was the uh strawberry

1330
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,980
blonde do you remember what was in there

1331
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,140
see this is

1332
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:33,240
what I remember

1333
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:36,299
with Steve is he he had a whole bunch of

1334
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:40,459
strains that were were good and I like

1335
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:43,200
um this here is uh uh big funk

1336
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,720
which was one of his screens and then uh

1337
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,000
the strawberry uh sorry the Sweet Tooth

1338
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:50,639
number four gotcha

1339
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,780
I'm pretty sure again Steve would be

1340
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,118
better

1341
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,760
to understand it and I think part of

1342
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:59,780
this is

1343
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:04,020
um correct and part of it might be

1344
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:06,420
just my interpretation of it yeah I

1345
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:09,000
believe that he had a bunch of strains

1346
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:12,000
that were

1347
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,980
uh or he had he had one strain or he had

1348
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,380
a few strains that he thought were

1349
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,858
[ __ ] great okay and he found that

1350
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:22,800
[ __ ] resinous blueberry male he

1351
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:25,199
crossed everything with it now

1352
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,559
it was my understanding is when he got

1353
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:31,739
the um the the sweet pink grapefruit

1354
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:36,180
cutting yeah in California two cuttings

1355
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:37,679
came up to Vancouver Vic who I'm pretty

1356
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:39,719
sure that's the guy's name not sure what

1357
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,639
he was didn't get the best reputation

1358
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:46,439
with the boys yeah

1359
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:49,019
um one cut and Steve got one cut are you

1360
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,000
talking about Vic High yes yeah okay

1361
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,759
yeah so but I don't know who he is like

1362
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,659
yeah he's no longer with us okay well

1363
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,819
you're good really clear yeah right but

1364
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,838
uh I have a feeling

1365
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:04,079
um

1366
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:07,400
Steve took that blueberry mail and the

1367
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,059
sweet and the the sweet pink grapefruit

1368
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,619
and

1369
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:12,599
crossed him

1370
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,579
and then grew out a bunch of this

1371
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,059
different seeds and

1372
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:21,300
one became Sweet Tooth one became big

1373
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:22,740
big treat one became you know this one's

1374
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,800
called Big Funk but that's not his

1375
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:27,058
original Siege so big treat was one of

1376
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,140
them

1377
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,680
um

1378
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:33,358
uh something bud I'm I know I haven't

1379
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,159
seen someplace I just don't know where

1380
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:36,119
the [ __ ] they are

1381
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,239
um

1382
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:41,280
but uh I have a feeling that Steve ended

1383
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:42,899
up with

1384
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,660
um

1385
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:48,420
a bunch of different phenos of that

1386
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:51,000
those two strains and that's what he

1387
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,460
started building his catalog off of yeah

1388
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,300
and then you know the Sweet Tooth which

1389
00:56:53,460 --> 00:57:01,139
was one of his more favorite I know he

1390
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:04,200
wanted to back cross it

1391
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:07,139
um maybe to that same blueberry

1392
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,960
or to the grapefruit and that kind of

1393
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,179
took different lines

1394
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,920
and stuff like that yeah so he had the

1395
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,369
uh he had two different shishka berries

1396
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,500
yeah the red line

1397
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,480
[Music]

1398
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,659
um

1399
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:24,059
yellow the yellow yeah and uh you know

1400
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:26,338
so I don't know

1401
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:28,319
you know did that come from a dip

1402
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:31,019
because that you know he was pretty

1403
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:34,619
famous for growing these big huge long

1404
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,838
[ __ ] Spears of berry right there's a

1405
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:39,420
picture of his wife holding him and

1406
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:42,119
they're like [ __ ] three feet long of

1407
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:46,500
just straight colas kind of yeah you

1408
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:48,180
know and um I think you know so I have a

1409
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,579
feeling that maybe

1410
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:53,639
the um

1411
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,619
the seeds were all from

1412
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:57,900
the same

1413
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:01,980
uh same crosses but just different

1414
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:03,480
phenotypes yeah that he

1415
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:07,260
started

1416
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,240
creating new lines and uh I think the

1417
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,059
sweet tooth and the shishka berry were

1418
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,959
the ones that really stood out

1419
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:16,019
um

1420
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,159
the strawberry blonde the big tree the

1421
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:19,318
plum bud

1422
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:21,719
Plum Bud that I just saw that it was uh

1423
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:24,239
yeah that was uh and I know I have that

1424
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:26,039
too okay okay I'm sure I have all these

1425
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,078
[ __ ] seeds someplace man I'm blind as

1426
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,000
[ __ ] though Plum I see Plum crossed a

1427
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,859
mighty might that was West Coast Seeds

1428
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,960
but yeah there's the plum bud

1429
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:35,699
it described it a little bit saying that

1430
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,318
it smelled very fruity but it didn't go

1431
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:39,179
into detail

1432
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:41,699
no because what the hell is this

1433
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:43,078
Gabriella Island I got yeah

1434
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:44,460
I wouldn't be able to see that

1435
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:46,380
collection I bet you have some cool

1436
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,000
stuff in there that I have no idea like

1437
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,460
it because I I keep track of everything

1438
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,219
but I just write it down and not think

1439
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,019
about it anymore

1440
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:57,000
you know like this pungent skunk from

1441
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:58,858
Legends right like

1442
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,900
what is that I don't even [ __ ] think

1443
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:03,838
we even sold that strain right you

1444
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:06,480
didn't no no and it was just one of the

1445
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:08,460
genetics that you know we grew out that

1446
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,740
we liked

1447
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,480
um this is from Khmer

1448
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:14,779
what the hell is this [ __ ] stream

1449
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,000
calz calzar

1450
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:20,460
colors are so that's a C4 it's like a

1451
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,199
Cali or calories I like to C4 it didn't

1452
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,599
produce worth of [ __ ] but it [ __ ] was a

1453
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,919
good train so like Calio shiske Berry or

1454
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,579
something like that yeah

1455
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,619
yeah so again you can't if I even bring

1456
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:33,900
up that name with Papa Bear forget about

1457
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,000
it like a [ __ ] it's like with red and

1458
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,019
Steve you just can't mention and those

1459
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,139

1496
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,160
[ __ ] uh

1497
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,519
um

1498
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:16,618
um fast fear yeah right I was all fast

1499
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,659
fear because I was in the field every

1500
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:21,240
day working I couldn't smoke Ortega I

1501
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:23,639
[ __ ] it would puddle me yeah well I

1502
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:26,279
would uh I was all about the [ __ ]

1503
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:29,159
night queen and the fast beer and now

1504
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,780
these strains are all strains from uh

1505
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:36,118
Neville yeah these three seeds came from

1506
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,500
uh little Eddie douchebag sorry I don't

1507
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:41,160
like a lot of people which one Eddie

1508
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:44,760
Eddie which one uh my Dutchman no oh oh

1509
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:47,219
oh nobody likes him yeah but um so the

1510
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,980
deal was he was hired by Mr hemp at the

1511
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:53,279
same time that Steve was and he brought

1512
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:56,219
all these seeds that Neville owed him

1513
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,298
the story was Neville old him owed him a

1514
01:01:56,219 --> 01:02:00,779
bunch of money

1515
01:01:57,298 --> 01:02:01,739
and instead of paying him he found a

1516
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,980
[ __ ]

1517
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:08,279
box of seeds in the back of a freezer

1518
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:12,358
when he had to jump ship

1519
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:14,160
and gave him to Ed as payment partial

1520
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:16,139
payment whatever so those seeds ended up

1521
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,239
in Switzerland they ended up in the

1522
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:20,338
field and we had that's where the

1523
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,979
Neville that's where the uh the night

1524
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:25,259
Queen the fast fatty fast beer or take

1525
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,880
Devil's Haze probably goes from there I

1526
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,940
don't think I don't think we had

1527
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,039
Neville's Haze in our field we had

1528
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,720
strains I never heard of right these are

1529
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,119
all strains no one's ever heard of

1530
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:39,298
gotcha because they were they were back

1531
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:43,440
in the freezer they were they were a box

1532
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:46,079
that Neville sold to somebody I meant to

1533
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,519
talk to Neville about this before he

1534
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:52,200
passed that and it was like

1535
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,298
five years ago six years ago I had

1536
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:56,960
another a new contact

1537
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:59,519
UM through the Mr hemp seed thing

1538
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,740
and uh I never got a chance to talk to

1539
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,780
him about it what do you want to ask him

1540
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:06,719
uh it was more about the history of this

1541
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,940
box of seats okay and what year was a

1542
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,739
box of seeds that's why I'm not sure but

1543
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,780
I could tell you that they were still

1544
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:14,098
viable in

1545
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,079
in

1546
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:20,460
um

1547
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:22,740
2000 yeah 99 probably uh the story was

1548
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:25,440
that

1549
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:27,659
um somebody ordered these seeds

1550
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,639
never picked them up

1551
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:32,940
so they got forgotten about in the back

1552
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:35,519
of the freezer when

1553
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,400
when time came for him to thaw out the

1554
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,079
freezer for whatever reason he passed

1555
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,818
them on to Ed

1556
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,740
for again what I was told for an

1557
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:48,420
outstanding debt

1558
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:51,000
and uh Ed broaden Switzerland and Steve

1559
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,338
plant him and Steve planted them and

1560
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,760
then Ed had a falling out with Peter

1561
01:03:53,338 --> 01:03:59,818
with Miss with with Mr hemp and he was

1562
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,920
gone and I was brought in to replace him

1563
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:03,739
and I they actually even gave me his

1564
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,180
phone I still had his phone

1565
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,259
when I got there which I think is one of

1566
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,759
the reasons why because it was still in

1567
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,500
his name and I was calling Canada and

1568
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,760
all over the [ __ ] I was sitting in a

1569
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,039
field in the middle of the hotel yeah

1570
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,540
why not I was like [ __ ] it like I don't

1571
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,539
particularly care for the guy anyways

1572
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:21,599
yeah and um so that's why that's what I

1573
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:24,239
heard did you uh did you have any old

1574
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,640
um early Pearl Early Girl silver Pearl

1575
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:30,899

1576
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:32,338
early days of Scentsy yeah

1577
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,680
um and then see this is the other thing

1578
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:38,159
that again you know we hear so many

1579

01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,579
got big titties

1601
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:23,579
she was uh Karen's partner in the

1602
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:26,700
Amsterdam she's Infamous out in the in

1603
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:28,200
the in the uh uh seed industry what were

1604
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:31,558
you gonna say about the Pearl and the

1605
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:33,239
okay so back back then

1606
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:36,420
um

1607
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:38,338
when it wasn't the Scentsy seed bank it

1608
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,380
was just the seed bank yeah yeah right

1609
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:42,000
so that was before Neville sold this

1610
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,160
stuff to Scentsy it was just yeah yeah

1611
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,019
so it would have been Neville now I

1612
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,460
thought it was a partnership between

1613
01:05:46,019 --> 01:05:50,280
Neville

1614
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:52,019
and Ben that was uh that was at First

1615
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,059
Bank

1616
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:55,440
I thought that was that's what brought

1617
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:57,720
the end of the seed bank I thought it

1618
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,480
was that when Scentsy seed started

1619
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:03,179
I don't what was it the bus that that uh

1620
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:05,639
made Neville sell to us to drunkers I

1621
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:07,318
don't know I don't know I just know that

1622
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:09,838
basically

1623
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:13,558
the story almost basically the story was

1624
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:15,599
told that Neville was the breeder for

1625
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:18,720
Santi seed bank he did breed for them

1626
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:21,359
for a little bit so but you know it was

1627
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:25,558
all of his genetics yes that he was

1628
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:27,259
breeding yeah so when when the first

1629
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,298
um

1630
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,520
catalogs were coming out of the sentency

1631
01:06:30,298 --> 01:06:34,500
bank you had early Pearl you had silver

1632
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:36,900
Pearl in them

1633
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,139
we loved it because again we were

1634
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,099
dealing with genetics that were

1635
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:43,318
um

1636
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:45,298
from Neville like these were these are

1637
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,219
the original [ __ ] strains like I mean

1638
01:06:45,298 --> 01:06:51,119
other than like the skunk and the

1639
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:54,000
Northern Lights yeah you know we were um

1640
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:56,940

1641
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,338
uh uh [ __ ] that's

1642
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,440
damn it

1643
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:04,440
there was a coffee shop who's who

1644
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:07,740
entered the sweet tooth

1645
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:10,019
um before Steve was that gray area or

1646
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:14,219

I should look it up but anyways that's

1652
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:27,659
the one that Steve tried it was gonna

1653
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:30,538
Fireball because uh we're talking about

1654

01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,420
Steve you can't do it if you go there

1679

you know it's he's gonna kill you it's

1680
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,020
going to be [ __ ] you [ __ ] because

1681
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:33,838
Steve

1682
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,940
is a big guy yeah I've never seen him

1683
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,920
fight but I wouldn't want to see him

1684
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:41,759
fight because he would fight in a

1685
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:43,679
[ __ ] heartbeat yeah and um you know

1686
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,000
so

1687
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,980
um

1688
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,798
but yeah fighting fighting the mob is

1689
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:50,459
not like no it's just something

1690
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:51,778
he was going to go in there and

1691
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,619
literally Fire Bomb the [ __ ] place

1692
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:58,799
like he was like [ __ ] [ __ ] Gary sucks

1693
01:08:54,619 --> 01:09:02,219
[ __ ] right so so anyways um so again

1694
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:04,439
this is again where you know we're we're

1695
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:07,739
like [ __ ] the elders uh sitting in a

1696
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:10,500
teepee trying to regurgitate stories and

1697
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:12,119
we kind of go by what we're what we hear

1698
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,298
and what we're told kind of thing some

1699
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:19,559
of us get to witness it firsthand some

1700
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:21,119
of us hear it regurgitated once or twice

1701
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,640
and we never know so that's why like

1702
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,798
with like I say with those seeds from

1703
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,319
you know the this fast beer this night

1704
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:29,519
Queen you know this fast fatty these and

1705
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,779
there's a whole bunch of other [ __ ]

1706
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,920
strains in there

1707
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:37,440
that you know I was I was told this

1708
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,020
story and it it anybody that I reach out

1709
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,298
to and and hear pieces from they kind of

1710
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,460
connect a little bit they kind of sound

1711
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:45,778
similar so about them being seeds from

1712
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,939
Neville and stuff like that yeah it

1713
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:50,219
makes sense for the time most times it

1714
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:52,858
was based on his his one of the things

1715
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:55,739
that Neville mentions a bunch is that it

1716
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:56,880
seems like 90 of what he made he never

1717
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:59,039
released

1718
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,079
in the sense that he had strains that he

1719
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,939
liked that got put on the catalogs but

1720
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:05,460
he'd make hybrids of all kinds of things

1721
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:07,979
right and only a tiny percentage of

1722
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,420
those things ever got offered up an

1723
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:10,799
actual sale

1724
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,420
we wouldn't

1725
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,900
um

1726
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:18,420
we wouldn't uh breed I wouldn't breed

1727
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:19,799
anything without somebody else's

1728
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:24,119
permission

1729
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:27,179
unless it was a publicly you know

1730
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:30,119
um uh available anybody can buy seeds

1731
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:32,880
from like sexy Bank you know I would

1732
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:35,579
breed and not think about now with Luke

1733
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,560
I wouldn't do that because because you

1734
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:40,738
know he's very particular well and he's

1735
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,659
he's small and same as uh

1736
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:44,939
um you know so the small one same as

1737
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:47,279
Soma yeah

1738
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:50,039
I wouldn't uh I wouldn't read any of his

1739
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:52,800
stuff unless I would you know I kind of

1740
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:55,679
asked him kind of thing and even with

1741
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,239
this like with all my genetics my my uh

1742
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,158
B-93

1743
01:10:57,238 --> 01:11:01,619
I don't want to I can't sell that strain

1744
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:03,179
like people I was offered a lot of money

1745
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:06,179
for it I'm working out a deal right now

1746
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:08,760
to trade somebody for it but it's gonna

1747
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,679
be and it's just because I want uh Sam

1748
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,420
skunk

1749
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:14,940
um

1750
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,340
um I have an opportunity to get the one

1751
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:20,099
of the original skunk one Cuts back oh

1752
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,779

1753
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,500

1754

epileptic [ __ ] kid yeah yeah which

1755
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:31,260
one tell you so this is just this kid

1756
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:33,899
that um Frills was yeah so he was

1757
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,060
brought to me by the TCC the Toronto

1758
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:37,079
Compassion Center uh said listen we have

1759
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,679
this kid

1760
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:42,179
uh he's uh he's a good grower

1761
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:43,619
um but he's mixed up with the wrong

1762
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:46,079
people we need to get him out of this

1763
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:48,179
town can you take them brought him and

1764
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,698
his mom and his sister to London set him

1765
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:52,140
up in an apartment set up a garden the

1766
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:53,399
whole bit turned out to be a great

1767
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,300
Gardener

1768
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:56,698
um

1769
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,739
but it went to his head and then of

1770
01:11:56,698 --> 01:12:00,299
course yeah that that that original

1771
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:02,879
story never

1772
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,739
finished I think he's still dwelling in

1773
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,500
that reality where

1774
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:10,198
he was always a go super big kind of guy

1775
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,300
and then getting in in business with

1776
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:14,819
really bad people and it would always go

1777
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,739
very very very bad out west like as soon

1778
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:19,259
as he left here because it happened over

1779
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:21,359
and over and over you know and like he

1780
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:23,699
would always be like like when when he

1781
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,139
would get [ __ ] destroyed she'd be

1782
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:27,000
like I'm never growing again I'm never

1783
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,460
growing again and then he's like buying

1784
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
or he's involved in these like giant

1785
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:36,899
farm chicken coops filled you know like

1786
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,340
it's you know when I when I met him we

1787
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:41,158
he was

1788
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,739
because of his and his mom I loved his

1789
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:47,279
mom and his sister

1790
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:49,439
um but they had no control so they would

1791
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,779
uh we would grow he would grow a bunch

1792
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:54,119
of pot for the center I would give them

1793
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:56,399
a receipt and then I would give them a

1794
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:58,800
certain amount every week or every month

1795
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,779
because if I gave all the money to Tilly

1796
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:05,179
which I did in a few times he went out

1797
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:05,179
and literally bought 200 worth of candy

1798
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,539
he's like I was like where's the money

1799
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:12,179
you were supposed to pay your hydro bill

1800
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:14,340
oh [ __ ] man he's like he literally had

1801
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,560
bags of [ __ ] candy and his mom you

1802
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,960
know well not just that but I remember

1803
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,120
the dude would be like stretches long

1804
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,279
stretches of time where all he would eat

1805
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,899
is like lobster dipped in butter or

1806
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,059
something like that you know like he was

1807
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:30,059
just that type

1808
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:32,580
it was always extreme like bending like

1809
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,260
like uh crazy that was after me because

1810
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:37,260
I didn't allow that then he he started

1811
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:39,420
hanging out with uh egg boy yeah yeah

1812
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:42,900
right they got [ __ ] busted in my

1813
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:45,719
truck yeah with 480 plants or something

1814
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:47,158
and I get sucked into it my dad got

1815
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,020
sucked into it because it was his truck

1816
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:52,019
you know and I was just like and then

1817
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:54,600
they drop off a vehicle because

1818
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:56,880
we switch vehicles turns out to be

1819
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,039
stolen right so I'm driving around in a

1820
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,920
stolen [ __ ] Jeep Cherokee oh that's

1821
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:03,300
uh really you [ __ ] douchebags but

1822
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,699
that skunk one that's the whole reason

1823
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:08,400
of story he had

1824
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:11,299
we had him growing the black domino and

1825
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:14,460
the skunk one and this skunk one I had

1826
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:16,800
again it just landed in my lap through

1827
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:19,619
all these connections I would imagine it

1828
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,980
would have came from the early Scentsy

1829
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:26,158
days yeah but it was that [ __ ] real

1830
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:27,599
skunk and it was a fine Dutchman I think

1831
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:30,599
it was

1832
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,539
is his name Scott does that mean

1833
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,280
Dutchman's Eddie Eddie right yeah and it

1834
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:37,738
was a common name so he was supposed to

1835
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:41,279
be one of the original skunk

1836
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:45,559
uh sellers of the seasons yeah yeah and

1837
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:49,500
so he had like some of the more pure uh

1838
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:52,320

1852
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:19,678
anything that I personally popped from

1853
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,079
Amsterdam as far as seeds that were

1854
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,319
available to the public that was the

1855
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:27,179
nicest thing I I personally found do you

1856
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:29,899
remember the uh the description they

1857
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:32,520
were like it would leave a man feeling

1858
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:34,500
whipped and something like the

1859
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,440
description that the that the boys put

1860
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,600
in there uh yeah full-blooded Indica

1861
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:41,460
with large bracks we'll soon have you on

1862
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,800
your knees and begging for more yes

1863
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,658
harsh overpowering lady simply gushes

1864
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,820
sticky resin to which most men seem to

1865
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:49,799
have a Fatal Attraction a word of

1866
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:51,420
warning this powerful compact Indica has

1867
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,400
had devastating effect on many a man

1868
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:55,319
leaving them apparently beaten and

1869
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:57,238
whipped with a strange smile on their

1870
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:58,319
faces not so usually looks like this

1871
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:01,139
after he gets done with the

1872
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:03,299
conversations with me though yeah yeah I

1873
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:06,900
love that kind of stuff and uh me too

1874
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:09,960
when we uh when Ron was doing the uh

1875
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:12,479
Canadian cannabis cups here in town and

1876
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:16,140
we had the Red Devil I kind of stole

1877
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:19,019
that kind of Mantra from from that to

1878
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:20,760
describe the Red Devil yes making up a

1879
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,620
bunch it was a [ __ ] fire strange it

1880
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,679
was great strain was a bunch of [ __ ]

1881
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:27,359
that I was saying but um I love that

1882
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,060
that's the first time I saw a red devil

1883
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:32,219
I believe it was Greenhouse

1884
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,659
that came out with that or at least they

1885
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:36,439
were the first people to sell public

1886
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:41,819
seeds of it yeah

1887
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:43,859
I ended up getting was from a alcoholic

1888
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:45,658
guy that was a good grower from around

1889
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:47,759
here

1890
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:50,839
um

1891
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,840
but uh

1892
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:55,139
um what the [ __ ] is this

1893
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:59,039
Red Devil yeah Greenhouse it's in your

1894
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:01,619
catalog and uh yeah Afghani Afghanistan

1895
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:04,260

1896
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:07,019
Shanti doesn't still we've I've never

1897
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,719
known it but like if if you know if he

1898
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:11,460
tries to sell a version of that based on

1899
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:12,899
you know because he sells devil but

1900
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,060
they've never explained what the [ __ ] it

1901
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:17,639
is right yeah I heard that too I heard

1902
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:19,980
about the devil but I don't know if it's

1903
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,039
uh and again the Red Devil was it

1904
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:23,639
cutting brought to me sure and

1905
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,859

1908
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:33,420
I was friends with [ __ ] crazy Ron

1909
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:35,039

Quebec Seed Company yeah that was his

1933

backyard along his fence line again this

1939
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:43,619
is what I was called he would grow a

1940
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:45,539
male and a female and then five feet ten

1941
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:47,279
feet apart another a different male and

1942
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:49,738
different female sounds about right yeah

1943
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,979
so if you were buying a seed and his

1944
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:55,079
seed was 30 bucks for yeah

1945
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:56,579
right yeah but he was saying oh this is

1946
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:57,840
Northern Lights oh this is this strain

1947
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:00,179
this is this train it's like no it's not

1948
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,679
he has no [ __ ] clue it might have

1949
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:03,060
some of that in it be honest with the

1950
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,100
people you only charged you thirty

1951
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:07,020
dollars a [ __ ] 10 pack yeah you don't

1952
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,280
need to make [ __ ] up yeah you know

1953
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,620
[ __ ]

1954
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:12,059
tell people that this is what I did to

1955
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:13,679
start reading I'm only charging you 30

1956
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,480
bucks you know

1957
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,399
but I didn't I didn't like him I didn't

1958
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,678
think I thought he was kind of dishonest

1959
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:21,238
well yeah I mean if if that's if that's

1960
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,679
how he was doing his [ __ ] it's obvious

1961
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:25,619
that like you know the cross-pollination

1962
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:29,000
is gonna occur you know

1963
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:29,000
um that's that's not cool

1964
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:32,158
so

1965
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,279
um what's up what are some of the

1966
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:36,719
posters behind you before I forget

1967
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,599
um

1968
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,899
oh this is a chemo I've never seen

1969
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,980
before that the uh the one chemo and now

1970
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,960
I think

1971
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,658
it's the

1972
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:51,239
[ __ ] I don't even remember I know one of

1973
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:52,799
them went pink and I'm pretty sure it

1974
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:56,158
was the Ottawa

1975
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,199
cut that went pink could be the UBC one

1976
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,319
but basically the auto one one is

1977
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:03,839
probably just a UBC

1978
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:04,920
uh that was pollinated this is a spice

1979
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,480
of life

1980
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,039
strain tube I don't know who the [ __ ]

1981
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:09,718
Eric is

1989
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:33,899
it's so [ __ ] cool UBC chemo all right

1990
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:36,238
chemo poster yeah it was a [ __ ]

1991
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:38,399
centerfold in High Time

1992
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,779
I'm just gonna pick this up so this here

1993
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:42,658
is

1994
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:46,619
where's the camera there we go there we

1995
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:49,379
go so this here is the berry berry oh

1996
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:52,319
nice uh so and it actually says it in

1997
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:54,359
the upper corner yeah yeah and then uh

1998
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,899
sorry I have to try to get the so this

1999
01:20:54,359 --> 01:20:59,399
here is the chemo that it might be the

2000
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:02,099
Ottawa because it's pink pistol yeah I

2001
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:03,539
think I think it is and I can you know

2002
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,880
this is what I've been told but it's

2003
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:07,560
super nice because it's super pink yeah

2004
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,739
it's beautiful

2005
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,539
um I I have tons of [ __ ] photos of it

2006
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:15,059
dude I see you know I told people for

2007
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:16,439
years like chemo sounded cool but like

2008
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,179
and everybody always said they liked it

2009
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:21,238
but the name always turned me off yeah

2010
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:24,239
well again the theory the the history

2011
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:27,718
was like the G13 yeah that it came out

2012
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:30,238
of California and it was used uh for

2013
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,520
medical patients that were called chemo

2014
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,859
right and then

2015
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,320
um maybe the cut came out a piece out of

2016
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:40,738
um California might have been called

2017
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:43,500
something else yeah got to UBC they were

2018
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:45,599
using it maybe for medical uh for chemo

2019
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:48,119
patients that's how it got its name but

2020
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,380
I was just told that uh yeah it got its

2021
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:52,920
name from uh

2022
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:54,600
complete so this also this was another

2023
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,539
centerfold it's [ __ ] it's hard to see

2024
01:21:54,600 --> 01:22:00,600
because of the uh yeah what is this one

2025
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:02,039
that's also berry berry

2026
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,900
um yeah so you can't really see it it

2027
01:22:02,039 --> 01:22:06,600
may be better that way but

2028
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:09,420
um it was like it was a go-to strain for

2029
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,539
me for a long time yeah because it was

2030
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:15,079
just uh it was so

2031
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:18,960
interested

2032
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:21,719
about this chat is because it we wildly

2033
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,880
bounce around there's like all kinds of

2034
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,340
of things that I think of that I want to

2035
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,619
chat about and then by the time that I

2036
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:30,920
wanted to merged on to some different

2037
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:33,599
year totally different people whatever

2038
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,119
it's amazing in that regard because

2039
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,579
we're covering so much ground but uh

2040
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,698
yeah yeah you said you're friends with

2041

2043
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,300
spear that's in uh with his no shirt on

2044
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,860
this [ __ ] guy he showed up to the

2045
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,480
field I'll see if I can find a picture

2046
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:53,759
can you take a picture of that later and

2047

send it to me yeah send it to him so

2048
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,020
there was Matt there was this uh we I

2049
01:22:56,279 --> 01:23:00,719
used to go to these Harvest festivals in

2050
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:02,219
the early 2000s yeah and there was this

2051
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,420
guy Matt knows who he is there was this

2052
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:06,300
guy chip

2053
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:08,640
um that started Royal gold Matt and he

2054
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:11,100
had just been out to Switzerland I think

2055
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,600
it was in 01 maybe or something and so I

2056
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:15,120
remember the first time I saw pictures

2057
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,940
like you were mentioning of those fields

2058
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,519
and hectors and huge greenhouses and all

2059
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:21,899
that he came back with all these photos

2060
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,780
on his computer

2061
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:26,460
of all these people in Switzerland that

2062
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:29,359
were just starting to blow it up and at

2063
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:31,800
the time it was the largest yeah

2064
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:33,960
they were doing it under aromathery so

2065
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,000
we had this is one of a this is a field

2066
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:41,340
here one of the fields with me let's see

2067
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,779
oh yeah Jesus yeah and uh it was for uh

2068
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,940
aromatherapy

2069
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:47,219
that's kind of a that's us harvesting

2070
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:49,079
some of them kind of I remember way back

2071
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:51,359
then when you were out there somebody

2072
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:53,579
showed me a picture because you weren't

2073
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,158
around and it was you sitting in an

2074
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:59,039
armchair oh and you had flower up to

2075
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,779
your knees yeah all you've seen in the

2076
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,179
frame was like flour up to your knees

2077
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:04,800
yeah it was so funny and for the young

2078
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:07,020
people watching now that are like in

2079
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,340
their in their 20s looking at this and

2080
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:11,420
they're thinking yeah that's it right

2081
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:14,159
there we did we had terracotta floors

2082
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:16,920
and we didn't have enough place to hang

2083
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:19,379
it so if you the funniest thing is on

2084
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,140
the on the table there there's only uh

2085
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:23,940
two sets of scissors

2086
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:25,920
we didn't know it we we had to harvest

2087
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:28,139
all the tops so we went through the

2088
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,579
field harvested all the tops brought

2089
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,079
them back and we're like we can't even

2090
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,179
hang them there's not enough to say so

2091
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:34,859
we just laid them all terracotta and we

2092
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:37,859
just went in and rotated them every day

2093
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:39,658
and that's uh me sitting in the chair I

2094
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:41,219
can I mean for people like Matt was

2095
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:44,099
saying for people that are younger I

2096
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:46,500
think Switzerland for the most part was

2097
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,760
the first time that it was like us

2098
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:52,800
seeing like non-land race type pictures

2099
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,100
of you know people actually growing on

2100
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,860
that large of a scale yeah

2101
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:01,260
grows so bad like people are used to

2102
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:02,639
seeing big CBD grows here is what I'm

2103
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,320
saying like people our age are used to

2104
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,420
seeing these massive hemp grows and

2105
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:08,219
stuff but people during that era you

2106
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,960
would never [ __ ] see this so it was

2107
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:12,300
really it was a really unique time it

2108
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:14,399
was a very special time and for that era

2109
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:17,340
like people in the U.S seeing stuff like

2110
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:20,279
this was mind-blowing at the time yeah

2111
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:22,140
see this year that's we had a company in

2112
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,759
town called novaks and you're supposed

2113
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:26,100
to take your bag into different parts of

2114
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:29,159
the world and uh enter it in a contest

2115
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,600
right yeah and I basically got the most

2116
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:34,559
votes but they can't they because it

2117
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,360
wasn't legal I got [ __ ] uh there was

2118
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,520
a do you know Felix

2119
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:42,119
um oh yeah

2120
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:46,520
yeah owls yeah yeah so uh this is his

2121
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:46,519
field in in Switzerland wow

2122
01:25:47,238 --> 01:25:54,779
he had such shooting plans but I mean

2123
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:57,359
yeah yeah his uh like his this is his

2124
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:59,039
his what his field looked like

2125
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:00,899
you know do you have any of his stuff

2126
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:02,698
saved

2127
01:26:00,899 --> 01:26:04,799
I think so he used to supply so

2128
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:05,939
impossible to get it's so impossible to

2129
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,860
get in the U.S because he just never

2130
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:10,519
shipped here so it was like and then the

2131
01:26:07,859 --> 01:26:10,519
distributors

2132
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:14,759
the uh oh so this is the Sweet Tooth

2133
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,639
Garden

2134
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:19,739
um oh very cool that's what we we

2135
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,940
um sorry for the [ __ ] no I've seen

2136
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:24,559
yeah I've seen that picture before I

2137
01:26:20,939 --> 01:26:27,919
think that's a great picture yeah and um

2138
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,920
on your Instagram

2139
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,580
I think that one is there's there's a

2140
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:40,939
few of the Switzerland that's activity

2141
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:40,939
that's the skunk one on this side oh wow

2142
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,039
yeah so that's the blind story it's a

2143
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:48,719
dark picture yeah he has the black

2144
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,460

2145
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,319
offload that let us know so we can make

2146
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:55,198

2147
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:57,779

2150
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:09,599
95 and the um B93 anything would be nice

2151
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:13,379
because it was our Northern Lights so

2152
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,300
yeah so this was my version of Northern

2153
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:17,639
Lights And if you look at the size

2154
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,679
that's a four inch Cube oh wow yeah and

2155
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:23,060
they were just following Hunters like

2156
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:27,000
when you see the the size of the nugs

2157
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:29,039
looking like it was like it was the best

2158
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,520
sea of green plant and it was and it was

2159
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:34,500
an l like was it a pure NL I don't know

2160
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,300
but it looks a lot like what I would

2161
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,520
picture the nl5 cut looking like yeah

2162
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,779
yeah exactly and I thought it was just

2163
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,520
you know

2164
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:43,920
um it was yeah it was just a phenomenal

2165
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:47,460
cut kind of thing so there's another one

2166
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:50,520
over at [ __ ] about to lose that's

2167
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:52,920
funny dude yeah he's [ __ ]

2168
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,780
that's in fact we would we had such this

2169
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,000
is in Switzerland too so we had such a

2170
01:27:54,779 --> 01:27:58,139
[ __ ] good time

2171
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,960
that's when everybody loved everybody

2172
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:02,760
yeah and uh when he when that guy first

2173
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,939
showed up the [ __ ] Switzerland

2174
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:08,880
[ __ ] guy sees the field he gets all

2175
01:28:05,939 --> 01:28:12,259
excited he goes home and he shaves from

2176
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:15,060
his like shoulder down to his wrist back

2177
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:16,079
shaved his entire arms both sides I'm

2178
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,760
like what the [ __ ] are you doing he's

2179
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:21,679
like dude I'm running through the field

2180
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:25,139
with my arms out and I'm gonna make hash

2181
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:28,980
if you wanted finger rub he made it like

2182
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:31,020
[ __ ] 10 feet 20 feet lost his breath

2183
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:34,259
couldn't get a [ __ ] quarter of a

2184
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:36,000
[ __ ] gram off of them but his arms

2185
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,159
are shaved and he was done I was like

2186
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,560
you got to be fine like it was a good

2187
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:43,079
thought good effort he literally did

2188
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,820
shave his [ __ ] arms

2189
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:47,039
but I don't think he got a single

2190
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:49,139
[ __ ] gram of hash kind of thing so so

2191
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,179
we made it about two hours in right now

2192
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:54,179
there I know there's so much more we can

2193
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:56,340
cover oh yes um but we could do a part

2194
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:57,840
two yeah I was hoping actually that we

2195
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,219
could have you back and we could we

2196
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,179
could see if we could get kicked back

2197
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:06,920
yeah yeah or or maybe even Chris Clay

2198
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:09,239
also has an option because I know that

2199
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:11,639
like I mentioned before there was about

2200
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:13,379
I don't even know how many questions or

2201
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:15,119
how many follow-ups I could think of

2202
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:17,219
while you were talking about stuff but

2203
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:19,500
then we just tangented it off onto

2204
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:21,060
something totally different which is

2205
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,899
amazing no you don't have to apologize I

2206
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:27,120
have ADHD too so it's okay

2207
01:29:23,899 --> 01:29:29,460
if you read my book like I can eat a

2208
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:31,439
send you a copy if you need or I need a

2209
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,000
signed copy right very stream of

2210
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:35,638
Consciousness which I liked you know

2211
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,738
yeah it was my book is written that way

2212
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:41,039
because I wrote it as if I'm having a

2213
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:42,359
conversation and I had to hire somebody

2214
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,319
to

2215
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:49,198
listen to me take notes and then try to

2216
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:51,299
put it in [ __ ] order that's the way I

2217
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,579
talk it's not in perfect order and I'm

2218
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,619
looking at it going because I smoked a

2219
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:57,658
lot of pop back then I was like that and

2220
01:29:55,619 --> 01:30:00,238
I remember it happening this way and

2221
01:29:57,658 --> 01:30:03,238
then another story that crosses with it

2222
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:05,279
doesn't line up perfectly [ __ ] I don't

2223
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:07,079
know but I did make a huge mistake in my

2224
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,759
book

2225
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:13,260
um and it wasn't my mistake it was a

2226
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:15,840
misprint where it says that I grew a

2227
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:19,079
Cannabis Cup winning strain which I did

2228
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:22,679
it was a fast beer it was my [ __ ] not

2229
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:25,380
my strain yeah but I grew it I'm I was

2230
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,420
the one that chose to enter it in the

2231
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:30,060
cup those guys didn't want anything to

2232
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:33,359
do with it yeah I knew it was going to

2233
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:37,800
win because the it was honor the goddess

2234
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:41,099
which was all the female judges

2235
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:43,920
I got hired by sativa sisters Karen she

2236
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:46,079
flew me to Amsterdam just to be a

2237
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:49,440

2240
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:56,399
I got laid a lot

2241
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:58,980
