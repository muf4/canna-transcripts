cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
we're the traditional Market

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,738
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,619
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,590
this is the revolution

26
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:58,589
[Music]

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,140
hey what's up everyone Welcome to our

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,359
first edition of is it worth the hype

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,978
the idea behind this series will be to

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,780
have my review of some of the modern

31
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:11,219
hike flower that is out there and let

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,159
people know from an older Breeder's

33
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:16,798
perspective what I'm experiencing these

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,780
are never paid or sponsored they're all

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,520
on our own dime and the help of good

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,680
friends too we have ensured that there

37
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,319
will be no case of being beholden to

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,640
anyone for a good review so that's part

39
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,959
of it I wanted to put this out there at

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,319
the beginning like you know because

41
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,478
people kind of get that less transparent

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,699
about why they're giving good reviews or

43
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,319
bad reviews and just from the jump we

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,579
want to say we ain't be holding to

45
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,919
anyone

46
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,478
reviews or reviews

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,978
I have to edit button anyway so it

48
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,859
wouldn't matter even if we were I'd just

49
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,920
be screwed so yes with that said welcome

50
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,840
to the first official installment of is

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,118
it worth the hype and today I thought I

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,759
would start with

53
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:00,000
permanent marker so this name

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,280
immediately brings to to mind like being

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,019
in high school or just doing art and

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,299
smelling a Sharpie marker you know what

57
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,078
a Sharpie marker smells like right

58
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,840
um

59
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:15,180
yeah so or like a marks a lot you know

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:18,120
very acrid ammonia it like almost uh

61
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,159
hard set to place but everybody knows it

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,959
it's in your sense memory so that's what

63
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,818
I was expecting when

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,860
um I got this

65
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:29,280
um and today the flower that we have was

66
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,480
grown by alien labs and um I'll throw up

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,659
some pictures here

68
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,000
and as you can see I'm going to start by

69
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,859
going over just the looks not sure who

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
gets the credit but that's the permanent

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,620
marker I'm not sure what's in it it

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
doesn't really

73
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,739
cookie something that's all I mean

74
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,479
because realistically you're not going

75
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,719
to get a straightforward answer from

76
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,500
that those persons

77
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,939
um

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,360
let's see

79
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,800
picture up uh just for looks alone

80
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,379
um The Strain checks all the boxes for

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,060
the most you know most flower buyers

82
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,399
most flower buyers are going to be very

83
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,259
happy when they see a good grown version

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,939
of this

85
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,818
um it's a deep purple

86
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:13,919
super Frosty white resin visually very

87
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:16,799
similar to things like Oreos ogkb very

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,539
dense which isn't my preference because

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,480
traditionally I used to break up flour

90
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,120
by hand however with the flour mill

91
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:28,199
grinder and again not sponsored I paid

92
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,300
my own money for this overpriced [ __ ]

93
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,098
um but now I use this because it

94
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,819
actually is a great grinder despite

95
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:37,919
being overpriced I it's great it makes

96
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,539
like this dense flower be very aerated

97
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,859
fluffy and doesn't destroy all the resin

98
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,318
glands somehow I don't get how that

99
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,239
works but it's pretty phenomenal I just

100
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,458
think it could be done in a crate a much

101
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,819
better price point considering that's

102
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,259
all the magic that and that are all the

103
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:53,939
magic

104
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,419
you know

105
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:00,539
um so yeah visually it's beautiful

106
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:06,238
um can't complain like it's it's very

107
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:08,639
well grown uh it's not handled roughly

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,200
it's pretty decent um

109
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,438
I don't recall ever getting something

110
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,598
from Alien Labs before but

111
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,060
based on all the other stuff that I have

112
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,399
gotten recently from

113
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,079
that brand

114
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,379
um

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,600
Loud Pack uh all AKA whoever they're

116
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:30,240
selling through that day

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
that that stuff doesn't even compare the

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
quality of this so

119
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,539
shout out and props to alien labs for

120
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,299
for good quality on this [ __ ] for real

121
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,160
and um shout out to my homie who who

122
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,220
sent this my way this impressions are

123
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:49,139
sin so what I like to do scent I like to

124
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:51,600
uh grind it up now prior to grinding I

125
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,918
like to smell the bud on its own and see

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,439
what I smell there and see if anything

127
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,120
more comes out after the grind so I'll

128
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,439
explain what I smelled beforehand I

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,620
wrote it down

130
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,418
um I said doughy Sherby cookies

131
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,680
so that isn't super helpful at all for

132
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:06,839
folks who didn't have a lot of

133
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,879
experience with any decent sourced

134
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,439
version of any of those cuts or S ones

135
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,339
so I'm going to try to elaborate a

136
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,560
little more

137
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,599
um the first scent and this is gonna

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,800
confuse some people because immediately

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,360
they're going to go to burnt rubber

140
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,500
that's not what I'm talking about

141
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,699
the first scent I get here is a car tire

142
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,800
shop

143
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,538
like the actual shop where they sell

144
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,560
tires

145
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,719
um

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,339
it's not burnt rubber but it is the

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,199
smell of a tire shop and it's just one

148
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,939
of the many smells in it

149
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,819
um the next scent is the most people

150
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,680
typically refer to as doughy and if you

151
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:42,899
think of it like um in the sense of like

152
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,038
making a cake vanilla cake batter at

153
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,239
home

154
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:51,240
um that's more of the line of what I'm

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,699
thinking as opposed to a baked cake that

156
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,478
you can smell the sweetness from you can

157
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,500
almost taste it from the smell with with

158
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,959
cake batter

159
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,579
it's more doughy there's eggs there's

160
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,879
you know milk there's all kinds of other

161
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,859
stuff in it that when you mix it up it

162
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,959
combines into this very specific smell

163
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,538
that is the smell underlying a lot of

164
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,180
cookies and a lot of triangle a lot of

165
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,680
OG Kush Expressions because of the

166
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,819
triangle

167
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,759
um

168
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,019
yeah let's see what else we got but I um

169
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,460
I'm only getting a fraction of some of

170
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,439
the smell I typically associate with

171
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,478
sherb types which is

172
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,360
and it's like all of that with some

173
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,219
peppery spice to me now not everybody

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,100
smells that some I mean there's gas in

175
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,039
it too there's fuel there's candy but

176
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,020
like the overall the unique smells about

177
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,800
sure that peppery stands out a lot to me

178
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,799
and I don't smell

179
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,979
that here

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,019
um there's some oh that's what that

181
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,538
herbaceous smell is not quite black

182
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,399
licorice but actual enemies that's or

183
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:57,659
anise I don't know how you pronounce I

184
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:00,299
say iniestas anise anus I don't know

185
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,740
yeah that's there that's the smell of it

186
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,020
um I was going to refer to as Herby

187
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,639
um and I said I also say this particular

188
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:12,120
Grove this cut is very nice old school

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,100
kind bud smell in in it that's

190
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,660
attractive that one is harder to pin

191
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,000
down other than herbaceous and fresh

192
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,220
which I just figured out

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,819
um that was from the grinding

194
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,479
um

195
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,479
see

196
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,939
um but it's not something I often smell

197
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,318
on cookies types this actually did pique

198
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,360
my interest in the strain so when I open

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,960
up the bag and I started smelling this

200
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,000
stuff I was like yeah that's that's an

201
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,439
old school good smell

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,199
through the grinder it all smells

203
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,538
exactly the same except that I was able

204
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,699
to pin down the Anis so by crushing it

205
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,740
up that flavor or that scent came

206
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,720
forward a lot more for me so it's much

207
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,538
more identifiable than just Herbie fresh

208
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,900
it's it's

209
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:56,639
anus anyway uh look manicure overall

210
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,198
thoughts on appearance um for being from

211
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,300
California facility it does look well

212
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,939
grown and like someone put time in care

213
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,319
into it uh into the dragon cure the

214
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,418
scent is strong and the dry is perfect

215
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,979
not too dry not overly moist and

216
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,500
unsmokable the resin glands appear

217
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,240
intact not overly handled and no

218
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,160
oxidation or signs from being a

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,900
greenhouse grow or past is indoor which

220
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
I'm learning is like

221
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,939
the

222
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,939
classic thing to do now is to stick

223
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,379
greeny [ __ ] in mylars and know that all

224
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,199
the people buying mylars probably aren't

225
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,139
going to pick up on it so yeah so what

226
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,300
I'm going to go ahead and do is uh start

227
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,219
with our first sesh and that's going to

228
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,458
be combustion

229
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,940
so I'm gonna grind some up and put it in

230
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:44,519
the C2 Bowl which I managed to drop

231
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,980
straight on tile today

232
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,860
and not have break which is a first for

233
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,100
bowls you want to check it out it's very

234
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:57,720
very thick and makes the grade as a nice

235
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,180
built-in filter in it even the um

236
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,360
this side is really thick too this is

237
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,799
what usually explodes like had I dropped

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,019
this bowl

239
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,519
on tile we wouldn't be talking we

240
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,879
wouldn't see be seeing a picture of this

241
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,200
bowl they just don't make it but these

242
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,480
things are uh

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,399
special they're made for idiots like me

244
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,620
that drop Scruff and so is this this

245
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,458
stuff's

246
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,440
solid

247
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,539
anyway

248
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,580
let's give it a rip here and see what

249
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,079
what

250
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,220
wow

251
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,560
okay

252
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,320
so the flavor

253
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,599
the flavor tastes like sherb to me

254
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,040
that I didn't expect it's got a lot of

255
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,778
flavor

256
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,278
it's actually got a good flavor to it

257
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,679
too I mean it's like a good version of

258
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,399
the sherb flavor which I'm not a big fan

259
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,559
of the sure flavor I don't hate it but

260
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,940
this is tasty this actually has really

261
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,059
good flavor which shows that it was dry

262
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,080
and cured well grown well

263
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,079
manic geared well

264
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,759
yeah the sherb

265
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,039
I wish I could describe the sherb flavor

266
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,419
it was so hard for me I can always do

267
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,419
scent but flavor's much harder

268
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,838
not gassy

269
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,939
you know what

270
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,160
the rip

271
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,600
the rip will help with this the rip will

272
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,939
help with the flavor and be pinning down

273
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,700
some stuff so this is why I don't just

274
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,200
do just combustion in these reviews

275
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,899
because I've learned after after coming

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,120
across this beautiful technology of

277
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,860
vapor wands

278
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,259
um especially really dialed in ones that

279
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,039
are very precise you can really

280
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:46,799
experience flavors and and scents and

281
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,139
highs that would have been burned off

282
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,179
the second that lighter hit and not

283
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,838
giving you the same effect

284
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,120
um

285
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,500
all those volatile compounds are still

286
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,759
there and you get to enjoy them and

287
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,458
experience them

288
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,259
that I'm being destroyed so that's why I

289
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,518
love the rip and there's so many flavors

290
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,519
that

291
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:10,560
yeah it's wild it's wild so

292
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,539
using my uh C2 double procure

293
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,359
double ratchet perk

294
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,099
for the rip

295
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,079
with the microphone this gets a little

296
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,740
complicated but let me see if I can get

297
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,739
this figured out here

298
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,879
okay

299
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,339
got the rip on and the way it works is I

300
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,139
have a Sharpie a permanent marker

301
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,380
setting right there that I always know

302
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:36,120
to turn it to and uh yeah and the way

303
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,799
these work is you set it on the bowl for

304
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,440
a few seconds let it heat up and then

305
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,819
you start inhaling slowly slowly and

306
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,920
then the vapor starts forming and

307
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,160
realistically the first hits are almost

308
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,419
all terpenes for me and and flavonoids

309
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,980
and all that kind of stuff and you

310
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,399
really get the best flavor at the very

311
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,399
first hit

312
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,740
that's weird

313
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,660
it doesn't have a lot of flavor

314
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,659
as the sherb flavor but it has

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,958
has less flavor of vaping than it does

316
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,799
combustion

317
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,799
that's a first

318
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:20,399
I couldn't possibly tell you that is uh

319
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,040
that's weird to have no flavor with the

320
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,379
bread and it's not a knock on the grill

321
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,819
I think it's actually the

322
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,559
the only flavor coming through is the

323
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,000
sherb flavor

324
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,439
that I've experienced with sherb and

325
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,299
usually it's very heavy

326
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,160
but there's all the other flavors have

327
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,620
dropped

328
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,600
in The Vape session so

329
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,060
all that's there is a very light sure

330
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,680
flavor very interesting

331
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,199
because the person who sent it to me did

332
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,179
refer to this strain as very Sherby and

333
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,100
just by looking at it and like breaking

334
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,739
it up and smelling it and stuff

335
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,420
I really wasn't totally convinced that

336
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,480
it was that shirby in fact I was more

337
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:59,639
convinced it was along like a gelato bat

338
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,680
region you know um

339
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,278
I always write the flavor once you smoke

340
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,778
it I is very sherblike

341
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,419
um

342
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,220
flavor definitely is is all sure

343
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,458
dominant

344
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,200
um I really apologize that I can't break

345
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,899
anything down further when it comes to

346
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,820
the flavor of sherb other than

347
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:26,399
uh it's the flavor of that

348
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:30,660
spicy peppery cookie dough

349
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,639
sweet candy it's hard to explain

350
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,939
um but the flavor of it is just this

351
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,940
light

352
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,059
not even pepper though yeah it's it's

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,440
very hard to explain

354
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,419
um it's one you'll have to experience

355
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,000
yourself on that end I can get you there

356
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,039
scent wise flavor's a little tough and I

357
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,958
really thought the rip was gonna help me

358
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,299
like figure it out real fast because it

359
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,458
usually does but that is the first time

360
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,278
I've ever had something go from a lot of

361
00:13:53,458 --> 00:14:00,419
flavor combusted then

362
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:02,220
Vaped so that's a new experience and see

363
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,319
now you're learning with me I didn't

364
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,940
even know that was possible but yeah I

365
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,839
know it has a decent High

366
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,880
um

367
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm not sure how long the legs are but

368
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,620
at least I can feel the start of it you

369
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,300
know and it's not surging like Urkel

370
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,879
it's not making me paranoid it's kind of

371
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,799
bright Peppy Peppy

372
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,439
uh

373
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,179
chatty I guess so I should probably end

374
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,200
this because I'll just be rambling like

375
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:31,138
a dumbass anyway but yeah so overall

376
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,278
um I think the the writing system that

377
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,320
someone on YouTube offered was skunks so

378
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,338
I'm gonna find a little image of skunks

379
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,940
I'm going to pop it up right

380
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:46,500
here and uh yeah

381
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,880
I don't even know how to do that but I'm

382
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,339
gonna figure it out and I guess we'll

383
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,198
figure it out together

384
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:55,320
but I'm gonna give this uh

385
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,578
I'm gonna give this

386
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,260
because I'm gonna try to use a tough

387
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,879
rating system here like I'm Gonna Save

388
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,559
the fives for just like crazy

389
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,679
exceptional

390
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,659
you know so fours should be

391
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,359
pretty legendary

392
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:11,519
so I'm going to give this a three skunk

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,220
rating as in

394
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,500
something I would not be embarrassed to

395
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,660
hand to a friend that is a hype strain

396
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,339
and have them smoke it like this is good

397
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,439
enough that I think everybody would

398
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:25,380
probably enjoy it even some of us old

399
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,699
like curmudgeons that don't even smoke

400
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,399
hype stuff

401
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:31,439
uh so if that helps any I hope it helps

402
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,360
someone I've been wondering what this

403
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,860
thing was did it actually smell like a

404
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,879
Sharpie marker to me no not even close

405
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,800
um but it did smell very good it did

406
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,639
smell very good and it smoked pretty

407
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,859
well

408
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,600
um uh and if we're going for a high

409
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,519
factor I've got to say it definitely has

410
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,540
a pretty good height it's got a decent

411
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,759
I'll leave it there I'm gonna start
