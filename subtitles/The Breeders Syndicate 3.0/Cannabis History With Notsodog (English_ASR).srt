7
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,399
welcome to breeder syndicate

8
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,560
all right so uh i wanted to welcome not

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
so dog everybody um this is a very good

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,118
friend of ours uh probably one of the

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,640
oldest members of the canned illuminati

12
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:29,680
and uh a good friend um he has an

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
amazing history in cannabis and i really

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,400
think it's about time that be shared

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,118
with the public

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
so

17
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,920
for starters let's talk about what got

18
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,919
you into growing

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
um what got me into growing was pretty

20
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,798
simple really uh

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
i it was two factors mostly i grew up in

22
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
chicago

23
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,359
and so when i got into

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,239
smoking weed there was really two kinds

25
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,319
of cannabis you had access to there was

26
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,158
brown mexican which was about twenty

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,718
dollars an eighth and there was green

28
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,000
mexican which was about thirty dollars

29
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:09,199
an eighth and anything else beyond that

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,719
was incredibly hard to find and

31
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,839
expensive

32
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,719
and so

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,759
um

34
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,919
eventually um i realized that in order

35
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,399
for me to be able to

36
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,919
uh have a consistent supply i had to

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
start growing it even on a small scale

38
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,799
and when you first started growing what

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
were the strains that were around other

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
than the green mexican and that were

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,598
there any strains around that were

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,000
floating that were popular to be grown

43
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:37,039
at that time

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
so my my story is a little different

45
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:43,519
than most in the sense that like

46
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,920
i knew one person that grew weed uh

47
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
in terms of what we called kind bud back

48
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,518
then

49
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,840
so there was no um

50
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,239
there was no like community there was no

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,200
access there was no internet

52
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,959
um

53
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,039
there you know obviously like you're

54
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,000
growing in a police state where

55
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,639
uh the laws are extremely strict

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,519
and heavily enforced and so i think

57
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,919
about

58
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,879
maybe three people even knew what i was

59
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,958
doing

60
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,120
um and so

61
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,759
i got this strain from carbondale

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,560
illinois from an old deadhead friend of

63
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,719
mine that was called the crystal chunk

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
uh which i know nothing about other than

65
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,719
the name

66
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,958
and um that was really what got me

67
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,039
started in growing was just that one

68
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,840
little strain i mean we would the only

69
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,000
places that we knew how to get good weed

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,640
on occasion you would find it here and

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,039
there but it was basically either going

72
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,639
to dead shows or

73
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,759
that was really the only consistent

74
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,199
place that we knew chicago was super dry

75
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,798
and the

76
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,959
the demand far outstripped the supply so

77
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
um i didn't really

78
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
you know i i didn't know anybody i

79
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,479
didn't know how to grow my one friend

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,039
that knew how to grow he didn't even

81
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,199
tell me that he grew until he was about

82
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,759
to move to colorado

83
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,518
and he gave me clones

84
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,639
right before he left

85
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,158
and then i bought three books i bought

86
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,598
um

87
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,878
rob rob clark's marijuana botany

88
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,519
and i bought

89
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,918
ed rosenthal and mel frank's

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,639
growing guide and i bought jorge

91
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,198
cervantes's guide to indoor

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,199
and i read those religiously because

93
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,759
that was literally my only source of

94
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,120
figuring out what i was doing

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,360
yeah uh marijuana botany's been a a key

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,959
book for a lot of older breeders and

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
people very serious about this that's

98
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,000
pretty awesome that that was one of the

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,680
first books you picked up and were able

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,959
to read religiously i mean that could

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
have gone a lot different had you been

102
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,599
growing later and read like three pounds

103
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
of light you know

104
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,080
yeah i mean i you know i'd like to say

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
that i had some discerning like you know

106
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,560
taste and i just literally bought all

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
three of the books that were available

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,800
in like the independent bookstore

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
that were growing cannabis and those

110
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
were the three that existed

111
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,879
um and so i kind of just lucked out

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
there wasn't very many books there

113
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,038
wasn't very much information back then

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,800
about how to grow weed i mean it was

115
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,399
late 1993 early 1994 so

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
i mean you're talking pre-internet uh

117
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:25,120
pre-pre anything really there was really

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,680
high times and uh these very few books

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
and high times was uh predominantly a

120
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
cocaine magazine going back and looking

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,680
at stuff

122
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,479
yeah i mean you know now being an

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,360
experienced grower like i would shudder

124
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,519
to read a bunch of those articles and uh

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,879
have anybody like take those is like

126
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,120
gospel but

127
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,879
um you know i was young and ignorant and

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,360
had no idea

129
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,439
oh of course and and you know what even

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,319
even though i wasn't around back in the

131
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,079
80s and early 90s going back and

132
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,360
revisiting some of those old magazines

133
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,560
have been some of the biggest treasure

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,560
troves to finding old uh lost maybe not

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
lost but forgotten information that that

136
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,839
isn't currently in the uh

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,160
isn't isn't circling the interwebs

138
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,159
yeah i mean even even later on with like

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
overgrown cannabis world and stuff like

140
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
that any cannabis

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
source in my opinion does have a whole

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,759
bunch of tidbits

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,199
out there that are interesting but you

144
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,439
really have to have a pretty good base

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
of knowledge to sort through what's crap

146
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,959
and what's not

147
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
um and so really that's kind of actually

148
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,478
what started my

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
quest for knowledge

150
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,599
is that

151
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,879
um and who knows if i would have had a

152
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
buddy that would have been like here

153
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,719
here's how you set up six lights this is

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
everything you buy this is how you run

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
it here's some strains this is what you

156
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,079
do

157
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,439
that wasn't available to me so the only

158
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,839
way that i could figure out what i was

159
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,439
doing was by learning and searching and

160
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,598
trying to find every bit of information

161
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,000
i could to try to figure out how to

162
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,639
how to make it work

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,478
okay so we're going to jump over mendo

164
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
perps for this second and

165
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,359
the reason i want to do this is because

166
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
i want to go over why you chose the name

167
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,879
not so dog but in order to do that i

168
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,478
think we have to do you want to visit

169
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,478
the uh

170
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,478
the name first or the chem dog story

171
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,000
first or mendo perps really i mean it's

172
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,399
your choice

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,598
i mean that actually yeah that that

174
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,439
launches

175
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,959
five years into the future from that

176
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,759
point i mean i grew in chicago from 94

177
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,318
to 98 and then i shifted out to

178
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,720
mendocino county california

179
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,720
um and that's where all those stories

180
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,520
that you just talked about start to pick

181
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
up

182
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,359
um so

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
i mean i don't know uh which one you

184
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,439
want to start with either one is fine i

185
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
mean the mendo perps is probably the

186
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,399
easier one to start with because it led

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,840
to the other

188
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,839
yeah but let's do that

189
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,198
so i was uh i was living

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,280
in i had some friends of mine from dead

191
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,079
tour and that's the reason that i ended

192
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,719
up

193
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,719
in mendocino county was i had a landing

194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,199
spot in california

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,199
and so one of them was a glassblower

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,360
which at the time was

197
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
um you know really just starting to

198
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,879
spread uh

199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,840
you know there was a core of like bob

200
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,400
snodgrass and a bunch of other people in

201
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,239
oregon um and you know various hippies

202
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,560
and people connected to the dead started

203
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,120
to take up blowing glass pipes

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,959
as you know sort of the new way to smoke

205
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,959
and and you know it was kind of the end

206
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,560
thing to have and so

207
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,638
um one of my friends uh learned how to

208
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,158
do it and was um

209
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
you know but back then the tech was

210
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,918
pretty poor

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,839
you know uh people were fuming gold and

212
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,240
silver and stuff and heated glass and

213
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
they'd stick a fan in their window and

214
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,519
he bought this

215
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,879
literally yeah it wasn't actually it's

216
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
sad in the sense that some of the

217
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,480
earliest guys

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,160
um you know they have lung damage and

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,639
stuff like that from breathing in heavy

220
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,039
metals and not having proper

221
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,879
ventilation and you know air removal

222
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,719
systems and stuff like that to stay

223
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,278
healthy while they're working

224
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
um just like any other new thing

225
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,958
like uh like

226
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
when we first started blowing bho using

227
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,759
a [ __ ] uh a water bottle

228
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,879
coffee filter and an open [ __ ]

229
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,360
blasting little pan you know in a garage

230
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,838
clothes yeah or you know if you if you

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,240
were to blow bho back then and you use

232
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,760
pvc pipes and then you realize that if

233
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
you stuck your finger on the inside of

234
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,480
the pvc it would end up being all rough

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,240
inside and pockmarked

236
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
you know and then nobody had any idea

237
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,120
about how purging or anything like that

238
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
or

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,399
i mean

240
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,879
every every era i mean even like in the

241
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
in the dab era that started people used

242
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,200
to like smoke off like cherry red

243
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,839
bangers that were seven eight hundred

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600
degrees oh yeah um that obviously like

245
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,519
once you learn that's carcinogenic and

246
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,759
not good but i mean that's kind of like

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,320
when you trail blaze on anything

248
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,159
you know um you know everybody learns

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
off the back of others that came before

250
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,919
them and used knowledge spreads and

251
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,679
stuff so

252
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,599
you know in the 90s obviously before the

253
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,000
internet really exploded

254
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,278
uh you know knowledge was hard to come

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,639
by um it really was and so

256
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,039
you know like

257
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,039
basically like the the ways that i got

258
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,799
knowledge i knew people on dead tour

259
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,639
that grew weed and i would pick their

260
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,479
brains i would go to amsterdam and i

261
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,919
would and that's a whole nother movie

262
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,920
that we could talk about but i would try

263
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,519
to pick their brains as much as possible

264
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,120
and how to grow and then

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
mendocino county

266
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,480
uh being the southern part of the

267
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,399
emerald triangle had a lot of old-time

268
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,639
growers and a lot one of the few places

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,519
in america that really had cannabis

270
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,399
deep cannabis history at that point so

271
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,600
um by moving here i learned a lot

272
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,519
and uh

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,920
so anyway my buddy buys this piece of

274
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,600
property and he wants to set up like he

275
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,719
has some money and he wants to actually

276
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
set up a

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,320
a healthy

278
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,719
way to blow glass and so

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,560
we got this old guy who was in his 50s

280
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,079
at the time uh 60s right in that era

281
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,518
and he was a retired hvac installer so

282
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,759
he knew all about

283
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,159
how to set up the you know the

284
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,200
ventilation and how to get like you know

285
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,559
a constant 14 miles an hour of air

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,879
away from the

287
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,239
from the you know uh from the torch and

288
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,000
all this stuff

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
and he had cancer

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,639
and at the time uh

291
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,880
the um the lady i was with

292
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,799
um it was part of the reason why i moved

293
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,120
out here actually is because she we were

294
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,879
battling she had cervical cancer and she

295
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,959
was going through all this chemotherapy

296
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,838
and all this stuff in chicago

297
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,639
and uh cannabis really helped her

298
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,120
reduce her vomiting and all that and

299
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,879
it's that's a whole long story but but

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,399
basically they passed 215 in november of

301
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,439
2000 of 1996

302
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,839
and it came into effect in 1997 and then

303
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,320
we moved out permanently in very early

304
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,880
1998

305
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,399
and so i felt bad for this guy he was

306
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,799
battling cancer

307
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,958
same thing as my um

308
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,439
my girl was at the time he was kind of

309
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,359
older he was broke

310
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,680
and so i gave him like a quarter pound

311
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
of weed and some hash to help with his

312
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,638
chemotherapy treatments and stuff

313
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
because it really

314
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,799
had made a massive impact on like

315
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
controlling the nausea for the

316
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,559
treatments um

317
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,159
for my girl at the time so

318
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,719
he didn't have any money he was kind of

319
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,480
embarrassed to take it but i insisted i

320
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
mean obviously weed was worth a lot more

321
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
than you know this was before the green

322
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,839
rush or before

323
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,759
it was still essentially illegal even

324
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,839
though these laws had just passed you

325
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,159
know

326
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,720
yeah and all that and so he

327
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,159
you know um but i just gave it to him

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,639
you know and i was like look man i don't

329
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,480
care like if it helps you it helps you

330
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,000
you know don't worry about it i don't

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,278
need any money you don't have to feel

332
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,159
guilty just take it and so he kept us he

333
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,919
kept helping us set up this system and

334
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,159
then one of the visits

335
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,759
um he brought me this little like empty

336
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,639
pill bottle

337
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,240
and in that pill bottle it had um a

338
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,159
couple seeds and he was like you know i

339
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,039
used to grow quite a bit in the 70s and

340
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,639
80s before the helicopters came in hard

341
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,240
and he's like i don't have any money or

342
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,278
anything like that i don't grow anymore

343
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,039
but maybe

344
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,838
you could find something in these seeds

345
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,199
that you'd like i dug them out of my

346
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,000
closet so i didn't think very much of it

347
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
and i

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,360
thanked him or whatever and

349
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,479
i grew them up um and uh

350
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,159
you know

351
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,759
both of them popped

352
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,519
right and

353
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,078
um

354
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,159
i got one male and one female

355
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,039
uh so i grew them up to about three feet

356
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,719
tall

357
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,039
and i was getting ready to take cuttings

358
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
off of them and i back then it was like

359
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,198
you know there was a lot of bedroom

360
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,198
grows back then right sure um and so i

361
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,039
was i was taking uh in this

362
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,240
three-bedroom house i had i was going to

363
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,159
convert

364
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,720
one of these bedrooms into a slightly

365
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,559
larger veg and mom area so i had a buddy

366
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
help me build it out

367
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,319
and um

368
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,879
we built this room out got it all

369
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
situated and we moved all the plants in

370
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,759
there and the next morning i go in there

371
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,838
and he had missed a stud on one of the

372
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,838
one of the wood hooks and this

373
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
old-school heavy

374
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,880
metal light had fallen

375
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
from the hook and swung down and it had

376
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,919
chopped off the male of the base

377
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
i can only imagine the horror as you

378
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,719
walk in and see that

379
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,240
i mean at the time you know yeah it was

380
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,000
like the the light was hanging

381
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
vertically and just shining against the

382
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,440
wall all super bright and at the time i

383
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:40,239
was super i was stoked because at least

384
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
it killed the boy you know uh not the

385
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,399
girl

386
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
um

387
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,720
you know and so i mean i didn't even you

388
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
know and then anyway so i take cuttings

389
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
off this thing and i flower it

390
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,559
and

391
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,480
i've it you know it if you've seen

392
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,119
pictures of it obviously the the mendo

393
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,199
purple is a is a royal purple it's got a

394
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,399
crazy smell that's pretty unique to

395
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,240
cannabis

396
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,159
and so i had this weed of it you know a

397
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,759
few months later and i flipped out

398
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,240
because i'd never ever seen anything

399
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,600
like it and we need to to insert

400
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,079
something here

401
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,759
where we kind of explain to modern

402
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,319
growers even as recent as eight seven or

403
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,639
eight years ago purples were still very

404
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,959
not common to come across it was still a

405
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,320
a trait people were trying to braid for

406
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,399
there wasn't a lot of true breeding

407
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,278
purples so to find something that was so

408
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
black

409
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,639
so beautiful so purple and bread true

410
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,839
for those traits was something really

411
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,720
unique

412
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,040
i mean this is this is even before

413
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,278
i mean in 1990 this is years before at

414
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,439
this point any of the granddaddy purple

415
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,559
purple urkel

416
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,480
um you know any any of those ones that

417
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,159
kind of came in like the early to mid

418
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,720
2000s wave

419
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,039
this is still four five six years before

420
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,879
any of that even really began even

421
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,679
remotely to spread out

422
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,519
um so you know i mean literally like

423
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,319
purple weed back then was like hearing

424
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,039
stories of purple haze or something that

425
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,079
you'd never seen or there was something

426
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,719
there was some indicas you know um in

427
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,039
mendo that if it got cold in the late

428
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,759
season they would turn purple

429
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,240
but that was cold induced not natural

430
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,759
you know and this thing turned you know

431
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,000
uh royal purple in a climate

432
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,519
mid 70s grow room so it was pretty much

433
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,278
a shocker

434
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,198
to be perfectly honest yeah it would

435
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,039
have been it was it was really a shocker

436
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,319
and i was in my early 20s at the time

437
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,759
too so

438
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,879
um

439
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,560
so i bring this weed to uh to this to

440
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,240
this gentleman and

441
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,159
you know he

442
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
he totally thought he gave me different

443
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,519
weed

444
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,240
uh he was like oh my god i haven't seen

445
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,078
that he's like i only grew that one year

446
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,360
and i grew it in 1977 in kovalev up in

447
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,198
the hills

448
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,199
uh now people that aren't from mendo

449
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,879
might not know but kovalev is basically

450
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,719
a little indian reservation in the

451
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,639
middle of nowhere really tucked away

452
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,360
it's a beautiful valley

453
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,439
but it's super remote in the late 70s it

454
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,558
was probably even more remote

455
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,959
um

456
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,279
and so at the time that was 1998 so then

457
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,000
i realized that the seeds that i had

458
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,959
popped were 21 year old seeds and i was

459
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,279
22 at the time

460
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,880
so it was it was it was kind of a trip

461
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,359
and in that regard um and

462
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
you know like a lot of old-timers i mean

463
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,000
he

464
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,840
you know that's what he remembered about

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,759
it he only remembered the year because

466
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,038
he only grew that strain one year so

467
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,879
basically

468
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,319
he must have found a couple seeds and

469
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
some buds

470
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,960
threw him in a in a you know a pill

471
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,759
bottle and stuffed it in his closet and

472
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
forgot about it for a few decades

473
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,519
you know

474
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,600
so it was literally like a time capsule

475
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,558
uh to the late to the late 70s you know

476
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,519
um

477
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,279
and

478
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,079
actually to the early influx of the

479
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,918
first afghanis hitting the u.s

480
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,079
yeah right in that right in that same

481
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,559
era you know um

482
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,199
and so you know he he passed away uh

483
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,720
from his illness which is a shame um and

484
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,360
so i never really

485
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,919
i was never really able to get much more

486
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,839
information other than the year and the

487
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,240
location that he grew it and um

488
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,000
all that you know so

489
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,679
obviously like after i

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,839
after i uh

491
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,720
realized what it was i was super bummed

492
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,319
that i didn't have the mail um because

493
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
at that time i would have crossed it to

494
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,918
itself and everything and had a whole

495
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
line

496
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,320
you know um

497
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,120
and all that type of stuff but um be

498
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,119
that as it may i uh

499
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,199
you know i um

500
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,279
i passed out the female to various good

501
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,919
friends and things like that

502
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,079
and uh you know she survived and so

503
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
what's interesting about her

504
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,319
is that

505
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
i think she's unique uh in terms of her

506
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,038
terpene profile

507
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
um

508
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,079
there's nothing else i've ever smelled

509
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,000
that smells like her

510
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,599
and so it's just interesting in the

511
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,599
sense of you know you go through

512
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,119
different eras just like now

513
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,599
you know everyone's searching for skunk

514
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,000
which used to be a super common terpene

515
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,918
in the 80s and 90s and now is like a

516
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,919
unicorn

517
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
whatever the mendo perp smells like

518
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,640
however you'd like to describe it it's

519
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,639
not something that survived in other

520
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,120
modern cannabis strains

521
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,600
um so maybe it wasn't unique at the time

522
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:37,599
but it's certainly unique now

523
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:40,480
and uh and it does have uh according to

524
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,240
humboldt csi it's he said that you know

525
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
like was it ten percent

526
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,279
show skunky terps

527
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,919
yeah there is i mean i i got i you know

528
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,678
he he's done more positive work with it

529
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,200
than anyone probably and i've gotten to

530
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,559
go up and look at

531
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,919
um rooms full of uh s ones that he's

532
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,639
done and

533
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
it certainly is a genetic that has a

534
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,038
wide variety of

535
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,359
of stuff in there and we joke that like

536
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,319
you could give a few hundred s1 seeds

537
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,158
out

538
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,319
and uh various people could make their

539
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,880
own unique lines completely based off

540
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,079
what selections they picked um

541
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
you know there's

542
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,079
there's black ones where the buds are

543
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,200
all black and the leaves are black

544
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,759
there's burgundy ones there's ones where

545
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
the it's very dark purple there's a wide

546
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,158
variety there's everything there's every

547
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,798
shade of purple from lavender to

548
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,520
dark dark black to almost a burgundy or

549
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,679
a maroon there's ones that have pine

550
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,839
sole aromas there's ones that have a bit

551
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,559
of cush or a bit of skunk

552
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,279
um tall ones short ones

553
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,119
um decent amount of hermaphroditism in

554
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,678
there at various points

555
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,599
so you know sometimes when you s1 stuff

556
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,400
it kind of is what it is it's it's a

557
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,199
fairly narrow gene pool but she's got

558
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,919
a pretty wide gene pool and so that

559
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,360
combined with the fact that she's fairly

560
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,280
low thc

561
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,879
leads me to believe that she's probably

562
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,240
like an unworked

563
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,000
um initial land race from somewhere um

564
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,120
because most cannabis back then was

565
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,720
between

566
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,879
7 and 15 thc at best you know

567
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
sure and uh with the hermaphroditism

568
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,480
that that's and a lot of people don't

569
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
know this or understand this but in land

570
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,279
races and even specifically afghanis

571
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,599
when you run land race afghanis you're

572
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,440
gonna run into a lot of intersex trades

573
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,000
and and that's the way land races work

574
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,919
they're unworked um not all

575
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,558
but a good deal and and those early

576
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,759
afghanis tended to have that tendency

577
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,599
you know yeah i mean that's an

578
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,759
interesting thing too in the sense that

579
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,399
like i mean hermaphrodism is obviously

580
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,720
like a survival trait um

581
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,480
that you know allows seeds to be perf

582
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,839
you know to be created in a different

583
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,759
fashion sure um and so for us

584
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,158
you know since we had this big push

585
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
towards seedless it became one of those

586
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,480
things where like it's always

587
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,439
universally bad in people's opinions

588
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,599
yeah

589
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,200
but there's a lot of phenomenal strains

590
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,199
out there that end up being people's

591
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,840
favorites that have hermaphrodism sort

592
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,840
of locked into them for better or worse

593
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,839
train

594
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,240
wreck classic example

595
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,199
sour diesel

596
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,400
exactly old super skunk for sure

597
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,400
yeah and so and i actually think that

598
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,159
sometimes you know that's a that could

599
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,000
be a discussion for a different point we

600
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
touched on it in the live that we did

601
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,798
but that you know i actually think that

602
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,120
some terps and certain aspects of things

603
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,359
might even be linked traits to

604
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,839
hermaphrodism and that by breeding away

605
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,558
from some of that everybody assumes that

606
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,558
it's guaranteed it's an individual trait

607
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,839
that can be bred out with no harm to

608
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,839
anything else

609
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,759
and sometimes that could be true but

610
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,439
also i think that could be untrue and

611
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,759
sometimes there's linked traits that you

612
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,919
might really like that are tied into

613
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,759
that hermaphroditism at times

614
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
yeah i didn't learn about linked traits

615
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,119
until i was doing a lot of reading

616
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,719
hands-on it wasn't something that i

617
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,399
learned about early on you don't read

618
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
about it a lot in cannabis breeding

619
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
talks especially on forums and whatnot

620
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
but link traits are super important for

621
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,519
people to learn about it's a it's it

622
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,279
basically it's it's uh considered a

623
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,279
siamese twin type trait like you don't

624
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,918
get one without the other and it passes

625
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,240
on as such

626
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,880
yeah i mean and so you know in a lot of

627
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,839
regards it's like hermaphrodism became a

628
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,240
bad word because obviously like with the

629
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,720
way that the finances work in cannabis

630
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,599
like getting a lightly seated room or a

631
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,120
heavily seated room could be problematic

632
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,599
you know but i mean there's also this

633
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,199
thing where several of the most famous

634
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,079
cannabis families

635
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,159
of the last 20 years are essentially

636
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,480
based on multiple instances of

637
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,320
hermaphrodism creating a series of

638
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,519
things that led to some very famous

639
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,759
stuff

640
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,639
absolutely um in that list we have og

641
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,919
kush sour diesel chem dog what else do

642
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,038
we got

643
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,759
cookie

644
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,919
cookies exactly

645
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,440
i mean a lot of these things were you

646
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,520
know they were just

647
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,360
you know i mean people would get people

648
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,960
would end up with some seeds that came

649
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,678
out of their little personal or their

650
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,440
little small scale indoor room you know

651
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,080
that they would hustle to themselves and

652
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,558
friends and they would save some bag

653
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,399
seed and then that bag seed later on

654
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,119
could end up being some of the more

655
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,120
famous strains in cannabis you know uh

656
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:30,399
sour diesel was born off accidental

657
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,399
herming multiple multiple aspects

658
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,200
multiple rooms at different times of

659
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,720
accidental harms that's right cookie was

660
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
the same way

661
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
there's other ones we could talk about i

662
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,519
mean

663
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:45,359
gg4 was multiple accidental herms so

664
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,079
it's really humbling as far as trying to

665
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,678
breed where you know people put all this

666
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,399
you know you can put all this intention

667
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,400
and everything else into it and fail and

668
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,159
then some accidental stuff and a six

669
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,278
lighter ends up changing the face of

670
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,640
cannabis

671
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,159
absolutely

672
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,000
it should be humbling and i think it's

673
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,240
something people need to constantly be

674
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,319
reminded of and it's often overlooked

675
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,798
people try to add their own stories to

676
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,639
history to make it seem more intentional

677
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,400
but in the long run yeah it's a lot of

678
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,240
happy accidents

679
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,000
and i mean you know we we again we

680
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,278
mentioned this in the live but like one

681
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,599
of the reasons

682
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,159
that the actual you know what people

683
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,959
call the mss or i call the super skunk

684
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,039
or maybe some people call the skunk six

685
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,079
one of the reasons i think why

686
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,079
it became um you know so hard to find or

687
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,960
possibly lost was that

688
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,519
you know she was she hermed live pollen

689
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,400
at times early and late and she could

690
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,000
see the whole room for you um you know

691
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,320
at the drop of a hat at the drop of

692
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,839
stress or whatever and so people get

693
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,399
scared of that and they try to breed

694
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,079
away from it or they eliminate a cut you

695
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,038
know all it would take is

696
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:55,038
one time one room seating heavily and

697
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,480
you can't sell it for as much and you

698
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,400
ditch the cut you know and you don't

699
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,720
realize 15 years later that you'd be

700
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
like searching heavily for that exact

701
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,319
thing

702
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,159
um a lot of times people would eliminate

703
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,720
really good strains because they had a

704
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,720
tendency to rot or they had a tendency

705
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
to herm or they had a tendency to do

706
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
this

707
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,599
and there was other strains that they

708
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,519
could get as much money for or sell just

709
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,240
as easily that didn't have those risky

710
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,240
bits and so they would get just get rid

711
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,440
of it and not realize later on how

712
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,759
important it might be and now you know

713
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,200
20 30 years later we're sifting through

714
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,200
a thousand fake mss cuts

715
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:35,659
[Music]

716
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,000
as fads happen you know i basically feel

717
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,240
like the named clone thing and fads

718
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,558
is was really detrimental to cannabis in

719
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,720
the long term in the sense that like in

720
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,759
the 90s that was probably the golden era

721
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,440
as far as diversity because anything

722
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,000
anything that was good quality cannabis

723
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,600
would sell easily which meant that all

724
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
these all these different things that

725
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,439
people had

726
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,600
all these various like family oriented

727
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
strains that were up in humboldt mendo

728
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,319
that were grown every year they were all

729
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,399
viable

730
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,000
and every time a train wreck

731
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,320
or a purple craze or a sour or a kush or

732
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,759
a cookie or skittles or anything like

733
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,879
that happened

734
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,919
literally

735
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
dozens to hundreds of high quality

736
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,080
cannabis strains would get shifted to

737
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,679
the side

738
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,000
because they weren't as easy to sell as

739
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,840
what was currently easy and most people

740
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,759
only want to hold on to

741
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,798
whatever is currently easy to move at

742
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,200
the time

743
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,079
so like i mean to give a perfect example

744
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,798
in maybe 0.40506

745
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,439
when the purple craze was raging

746
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,879
everyone and i mean just about everyone

747
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,399
up here had

748
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,559
purple urkel grape ape granddaddy purple

749
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,079
um all you know mendo perps all these

750
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,119
various things because there was an

751
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,720
endless

752
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,959
you know demand

753
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,399
for with brokers for as much purple as

754
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,919
you could produce they would take and

755
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,839
they would go quick and so that led to

756
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,000
a whole bunch of stuff being shifted to

757
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,639
the side that was really good but you

758
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,278
fast forward 15 years and how many

759
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,679
people held onto those cultivars people

760
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,038
absolutely are hunting for original

761
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,278
urkel original gdp original this

762
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,960
because as soon as it went to sauer and

763
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:26,398
kush and other things

764
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,558
98 of the people that had it ditched it

765
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,759
yeah and weirdos like me and caleb kept

766
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,519
working purples because they're pretty

767
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,839
or you laugh at times when people are

768
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,038
like where's that 2010 era sour diesel

769
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,959
oh yeah

770
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,879
which is pretty late to the sour diesel

771
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,360
game but for some people it's like that

772
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,840
was when they actually had access to a

773
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,278
real cut and then they lose the cut and

774
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,038
they think they can get it back from

775
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,038
someone else and then they can't find

776
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,119
that cut again

777
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,200
and and and realistically a lot of the

778
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,479
times specifically with sour diesel 2

779
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
they'd be searching for a cut with the

780
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,960
name sour diesel and they would have

781
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,480
already been they would have absolutely

782
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,079
been growing a different cut not related

783
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,360
to sour diesel so they just won't find

784
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,359
it again

785
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,879
yeah i mean sour diesel you know we've

786
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,439
talked about it a bunch it happens to be

787
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,640
one of the more confusing and extremely

788
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,240
difficult uh families to sort out what

789
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,640
cut came when

790
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,079
from who where i mean even though we

791
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,840
know multiple people that were

792
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,519
originally involved and we've gotten the

793
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,119
chance to interview them and pick their

794
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,879
brains about stuff

795
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,319
there's still a decent amount of holes

796
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
and unknowns

797
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,558
and you know the cuts don't there's

798
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,759
certain things where like you know the

799
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,759
the the chain of of of you know of who

800
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,079
had it when is really well established

801
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,000
and with sour it's a lot more difficult

802
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,519
sure is i mean yeah that is pretty crazy

803
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,839
that we've been able to talk to the

804
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,519
people who first had their hands on the

805
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,439
original seed that was popped and we

806
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,480
still can't quite untangle the whole

807
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
story

808
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,399
and it's not because they're lying it's

809
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,678
it's not necessarily all of them you

810
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,839
know some of them are really good dudes

811
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,640
but it's just a matter of of different

812
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,038
perspectives and memories

813
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,399
and with that specific one i don't think

814
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,798
that there there was a you know

815
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,639
obviously there was a seated room and it

816
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,960
seems like even in the very beginning

817
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
there was at least two possibly three

818
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,159
sour cuttings

819
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,840
like you know popped by different

820
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,840
members of that crew

821
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,839

00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,398
um the mendo perps um

837
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,919
i um you know when we were talking on

838
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,479
our live and i was talking about the

839
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,038
history of super skunk and in regards to

840
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,480
that specific cut and stuff

841
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,240
um

842
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,880
you know the

843
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,880
the my buddy you know which i call you

844
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
know from staten island or whatever he

845
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,919
lived in sonoma county

846
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,120
and um i gave him a joint a purple of

847
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,679
mendo perps one day um not long after

848
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,038
i'd found it and he fell in love with it

849
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,440
and he

850
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,398
um he ended up giving me

851
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
um

852
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,038
what people now call the chem 91 and the

853
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,120
super skunk

854
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,879
for that cut sort of just an informal

855
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,359
trade or whatever and so that's kind of

856
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,679
like the mendo perps led me

857
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,678
to the chems is basically is the easiest

858
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,519
way to describe it

859
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,159
and now that we're touching on that

860
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,759
let's uh let's go ahead and do do the

861
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,519
the entrance to the chems how it all

862
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,960
went down um i know we talked about on

863
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,880
the live feed but there's gonna be a lot

864
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,079
of people who only listen to the podcast

865
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,039
and aren't familiar with the live feed

866
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:59,359
interviews so go ahead and cover it all

867
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,440
i'll give the i'll give the

868
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:05,599
a relatively short version of the story

869
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,480
because um our buddy uh skunk va has had

870
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,639
a uh you know has has told the story at

871
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,480
great lengths and stuff but

872
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,440
the cliff notes version

873
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,038
is that

874
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,600
um

875
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:20,000
skunk va being from virginia

876
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,879
had some you know hippies and friends of

877
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,038
his and mentors that were from that area

878
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,640
and uh him and our our east coast buddy

879
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,879
used to go and see

880
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,799
all the jerry shows the jerry garcia

881
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,559
band shows at the war field basically

882
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,759
every time he played

883
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,000
and so

884
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:42,640
um he uh our our staten island buddy had

885
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,720
this strain called the francine and the

886
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,640
francine was a

887
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,519
old indica really flavorful prone to rot

888
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,120
and

889
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,000
some of these friends

890
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,798
of skunk vas from virginia

891
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,480
flew out and were absolutely in love

892
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,440
with this francine

893
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,000
and so they told uh our buddy that if

894
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,798
you bring us the francine we'll give you

895
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,319
some skunk cuts that we really adore

896
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:12,960
uh and he at that same time had already

897
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,839
made arrangements with chemdog

898
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,240
um

899
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,639
you know chem dog had the chem dog and

900
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,159
he didn't want to pass it out to anyone

901
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,880
because he didn't want to get cut off

902
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,399
from his sources or his you know

903
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,640
he didn't want anybody to have it on the

904
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,839
east coast basically sure

905
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,519
but because dude had moved to sonoma and

906
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,480
lived on the other side of the country

907
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,240
in california he agreed to give it to

908
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,440
him as long as he didn't share it with

909
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,720
anybody back east so

910
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,679
um

911
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,240
homie drove the francine

912
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,080
from california all the way out to

913
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,640
virginia

914
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,240
and traded the francine for the super

915
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,440
skunk

916
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,679
uh

917
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,200
in 1993

918
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,960
and then he

919
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,798
drove up to massachusetts and met kemdog

920
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,960
and he got that's where he got the what

921
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,599
we call the dog other people call it the

922
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,039
chem 91 or the kem dog

923
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,000
he got that

924
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,759
um there was also the chem sis back then

925
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,440
but he didn't like that one very much so

926
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,639
he didn't end up taking it

927
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,039
um and he had some extras of the super

928
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,200
skunk and so he gifted one to chem dog

929
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,239
before he drove back home

930
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,239
and then he drove back home and brought

931
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,519
the super skunk and the chem dog out

932
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,479
west

933
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,480
um

934
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
and that's and how it ended up in

935
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,760
california

936
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,359
that's how skunk va and myself

937
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,359
and ic collective all got a hold of it

938
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,519
was through our buddy and so that's the

939
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,279
short version of how

940
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,878
so yeah it was basically

941
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,679
jerry shows

942
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:54,319
uh hippies liking weed

943
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,320
uh some informal trading and it just

944
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,838
kind of ended up where it ended up on

945
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,920
the west coast

946
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,440
and what year you said it was 1993 when

947
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,599
it ended up on the west coast

948
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,200
it was 1993 when it ended up on the west

949
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,519
coast yep and uh our buddy held on to it

950
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:13,358
for a few years

951
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:16,880
when jerry died in 1995 i believe

952
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:20,000
um skunk va like a lot of people stopped

953
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,838
traveling and got a home

954
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,280
uh wasn't on dead tour anymore and

955
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,838
that's when he started growing the super

956
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,359
skunk and he has obviously

957
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,519
posted some old polaroids on his page

958
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,319
which are amazing because it's you know

959
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,679
visual evidence of that exact cut

960
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,039
um

961
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,719
you know and um and then and then he got

962
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,400
yeah he got the super skunk and the chem

963
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:47,759
dog in the mid 90s from our buddy um and

964
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,680
then a few years after that i met um i

965
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,480
met those guys and i traded the mendo

966
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:58,480
perps um for those two cuts and that was

967
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,039
the start of me having them

968
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,440
okay and let's talk about how you got

969
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,759
your name

970
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,800
so that's a little bit more complicated

971
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,440
um

972
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,240
so basically um

973
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,240
our staten island friend he was an early

974
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,319
adopter of the

975
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,639
don't pass things out

976
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,119
which is unusual because he he freely

977
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,039
traded with me but for the most part he

978
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,640
really didn't want things getting out

979
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,559
and he really didn't want the chem dog

980
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,879
getting out and so if you got it from

981
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,279
them you pretty much had to swear that

982
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,559
you weren't going to pass it to anyone

983
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,480
um

984
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,480
and so for a while

985
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,960
quite a while actually this is like long

986
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,880
before the internet or forums made it

987
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,679
famous on any level

988
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,280
um there was really only

989
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,078
to my knowledge i think there was only

990
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,880
about four people that really had it in

991
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,680
california then there was him

992
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,800
uh

993
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:58,078
skunk skunk va um

994
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,760
a guy whose handle is icy collective on

995
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,599
instagram and

996
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,440
then myself

997
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,920
and so there was really only like four

998
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,200
grow rooms that really had it in it

999
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,159
and uh

1000
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:14,078
it was some of our favorite herb and

1001
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:15,039
um staten island and skunk va lived in

1002
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,119
uh

1003
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,079
in sonoma county i lived one county

1004
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,280
north in mendo and ic lived in tahoe at

1005
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,599
the time

1006
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,160
and so depending on who had the freshest

1007
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,920
herb we would trade amongst each other

1008
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,960
all the time to make sure that we always

1009
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,320
had fresh you know fresh chem dog

1010
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,720
and so

1011
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,720
um

1012
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,079
staten island drove up to tahoe

1013
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,800
the tahoe dog uh not to confuse people

1014
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,720
with tahoe og but like when the chem dog

1015
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,560
was grown in tahoe

1016
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,480
there really is something about mountain

1017
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,639
grown herb

1018
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,000
and the cold cold temperatures that you

1019
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,879
can get up there

1020
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,639
um

1021
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,160
i noticed this in chicago growing in

1022
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,799
winter if you can bring in 5 or 10 or 15

1023
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,358
degree air into your grow room it really

1024
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,000
makes the plant frost up

1025
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,319
um like maybe it's a defensive mechanism

1026
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
i don't know but if you can bring in

1027
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,079
bone-dry bitter cold air into your room

1028
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
um it definitely causes a reaction in

1029
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,359
the plant and so

1030
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,640
i see grew some of the most visually uh

1031
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,199
appealing

1032
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:26,078
uh 91 that you could find and so we

1033
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,239
would always get fresh batches from him

1034
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,320
whenever it came down and we would trade

1035
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,039
amongst each other so staten island went

1036
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,240
up

1037
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,159
and he got a couple pounds off of him

1038
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,479
and drove it back home

1039
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,399
and uh

1040
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,960
he met me and we were outside of this

1041
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,920
little town called willits in uh in

1042
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,240
mendo

1043
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,680
and it was in the dark and he want i was

1044
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,838
gonna get some of it

1045
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,598
and so he's like man he's like i can't

1046
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,599
believe it this stuff just it looks so

1047
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,280
different i've never seen it look like

1048
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,640
this it smells a little different i

1049
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,720
don't know what happened

1050
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,400
and so he hands me this turkey bag and i

1051
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,759
open it up in the dark and i stick my

1052
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,800
nose in there

1053
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,160
and i'm like it's not so dog

1054
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,839
he's like what do you mean and i'm like

1055
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,598
it's not so dog and he's like what is

1056
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,719
that i'm like i don't think it's the dog

1057
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,880
i don't think

1058
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,959
i i don't i don't i'm not getting the

1059
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,720
nose that i would expect he's like it's

1060
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,559
gotta be it's the only thing he has and

1061
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,838
i'm like i stuck my head in it again and

1062
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,599
i'm like

1063
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,279
no i don't think so and we got a

1064
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,359
flashlight out and we start started

1065
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,760
looking at it and

1066
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,440
it ended up it wasn't and

1067
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,560
it ended up it was a

1068
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,358
um he had uh mislead there had been some

1069
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,279
mislabeled cuttings and he'd kept a mom

1070
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,880
and he'd filled a room full of cuttings

1071
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,119
of what he thought was the chem dog and

1072
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,358
it ended up being this other cut

1073
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,880
um and so

1074
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,920
yeah and then

1075
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,599
when i was uh when i was trying to uh

1076
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,760
join when friends of mine were

1077
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,000
convincing me that i needed to join

1078
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,119
instagram and some other stuff and climb

1079
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,599
out from under my rock um

1080
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,960
i kept entering names into the thing and

1081
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,079
every single thing i could think of was

1082
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,800
taken

1083
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,680
uh which was got hella annoying

1084
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,039
so

1085
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,759
i just

1086
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,400
popped that name in as a joke and lo and

1087
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
behold

1088
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,639
it wasn't taken

1089
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:17,679
you know and so uh it didn't it was kind

1090
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,519
of like a like an inside joke between us

1091
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,239
um because

1092
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,079
of yeah it was i'm not even sure what

1093
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,679
that strain was to be perfectly honest

1094
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,560
because he only grew at one time before

1095
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,399
he got the dog back and got a properly

1096
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,440
labeled mom again but yeah that's kind

1097
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,639
of how the not so dog came to be

1098
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,639
i absolutely love that story

1099
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,559
uh what can you tell us about superdog

1100
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,960
um so that's a little

1101
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,279
that's that's kind of involved but uh

1102
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,960
basically what it boils down to

1103
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,359
is that um like i said staten island had

1104
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,800
the super skunk and the chem dog and

1105
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,000
those were kind of our two favorite

1106
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,160
strains uh or some of them at least

1107
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,639
and um

1108
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,118
you know uh him and i were doing a bunch

1109
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,118
of breeding together um

1110
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,200
hobbyist stuff i mean back then like

1111
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,559
there was no intention of ever

1112
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,719
uh you know selling anything like that

1113
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,239
whatever that was way long before some

1114
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,719
of these like most of these american

1115
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,479
seed companies got started we were just

1116
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,439
trying to

1117
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,760
um

1118
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,358
breed i'm kind of like the traditional

1119
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,280
way to breed right like we were trying

1120
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,279
to take traits from two different things

1121
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,560
and combine them into one

1122
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,920
and so

1123
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,960
um the super skunk had amazing terps and

1124
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,680
it was lime green and it was frosty

1125
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,639
and it reeked and it grew tall

1126
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,039
and the chem dog was kind of dark it was

1127
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,639
kind of ugly but it had incredible

1128
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,880
potency

1129
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,279
and so we were trying to see if there

1130
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,358
was a way that uh

1131
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,800
we could combine those traits in the

1132
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:58,400
same plant

1133
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,960
and so he had actually started the

1134
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,519
project before i met him

1135
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,119
um it was like one of those things where

1136
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,280
you'd laugh at it now where everybody

1137
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,440
comes out with 20 strains a year but

1138
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,599
this was literally like a

1139
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,920
four to six year project

1140
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,720
um that we would do here and there

1141
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,760
um and so he had actually done uh the

1142
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,879
initial stages of it um on his own

1143
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,280
and he had taken a hawaiian

1144
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,960
and crossed it to the super skunk

1145
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,280
and then that was

1146
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,199
i think it was it was brought to f3

1147
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,839
maybe selecting two

1148
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:36,000
the skunkiest traits we could find

1149
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,078
and then that was and then a male of

1150
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,838
that was hit to the dog

1151
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,839
uh chem 91 and um that got labeled

1152
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,920
superdog

1153
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:49,119
and then we hunted through

1154
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,920
a bunch of those seeds

1155
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,318
and

1156
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
found some keepers

1157
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,000
there's actu there's a picture in the

1158
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,000
second can of bible

1159
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,440
of some buds of it as well as a bunch of

1160
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,679
plants

1161
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,679
passed it out to a bunch of friends

1162
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,440
um and then

1163
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,559
you know we started doing this thing we

1164
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,240
did some

1165
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,119
line breeding with it we did some open

1166
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,759
pollination and we eventually

1167
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,318
did this huge open pollination um where

1168
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,440
we took like the seven best

1169
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,199
uh super super dog males that we found

1170
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,200
and we hybridized them to everything we

1171
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,480
had which would have been

1172
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:29,439
a whole host of stuff my maui cut fact

1173
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,559
the chem 91 the super skunk the warlock

1174
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,559
the black domina the mendo perps i mean

1175
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,119
basically every nice cut we had access

1176
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,920
to we blew off a huge room of it

1177
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,160
um and uh and yeah it really was

1178
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,440
kind of the best of both worlds um in

1179
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,239
the sense that

1180
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,800
the

1181
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,799
super skunk for all of its legendary

1182
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,400
status or whatever it really only had

1183
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
moderate potency

1184
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,760
and the terps were volatile in the sense

1185
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,680
that it smelled like a dead skunk the

1186
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,920
last two or three weeks of bloom and

1187
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,358
maybe the first three or four weeks of

1188
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,880
post-harvest

1189
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,119
and then if you held onto it long enough

1190
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,920
it honestly went a bit generic

1191
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,440
yeah you know whatever those terpenes

1192
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,960
kind of went to a little bit more

1193
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,039
generic green bud once those terps faded

1194
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,119
and the chem dog they were actually

1195
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,279
perfect to grow together because

1196
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,358
the chem dog took a while to cure and

1197
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,560
didn't really reach its quality until

1198
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:29,440
about a month after you cut it down

1199
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:33,039
where the super skunk was at its best

1200
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,440
the first month you cut it down yeah

1201
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,079
yeah so if you grew the two together you

1202
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,159
could smoke a [ __ ] ton of uh of super

1203
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,400
skunk super fresh and it would be

1204
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,838
amazing and then by the time the super

1205
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,079
skunk was starting to lose a little bit

1206
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,480
of its luster the

1207
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,720
the dog would be just exactly perfect

1208
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,039
and once the dog hit that perfect point

1209
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,118
it would stay good for months and it's

1210
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,559
um and so they were really nice to grow

1211
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,640
together

1212
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,920
uh and so we were trying to get

1213
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,559
the terpene

1214
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,079
uh and aromas and all that and some of

1215
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,440
the stretch i mean if you see those

1216
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,240
pictures that

1217
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,599
uh

1218
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,199
skunk va's posted it was stretchy

1219
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,880
where

1220
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,960
where the chem dog was a little bit more

1221
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,119
afghan a little bit slower growing not

1222
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,519
not extreme afghan it had some stretch

1223
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,358
too but not as much

1224
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,519
and so we were trying to we were trying

1225
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:26,000
to figure out a way can we get the

1226
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,400
potency of the chem dog

1227
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,960
you know mixed in with the vigor and the

1228
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,599
nose and the taste of the skunk

1229
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,440
and uh it was a hobbyist project

1230
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,119
and in a sense we did it for us and our

1231
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,519
friends and so

1232
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,440
um yeah we just basically [ __ ] around

1233
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,440
with breeding here and there in

1234
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,039
different rooms and different places

1235
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,358
over time

1236
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,079
working on it refining it passing out

1237
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,838
various cultivars we found to friends

1238
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,400
and stuff like that and that's kind of

1239
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,960
how it all got started

1240
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,119
so my first interaction with superdog

1241
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,720
was seeing it inside the can of bible

1242
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,720
number two

1243
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,559
and at that point you know

1244
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:10,000
at that point kim four was circulating

1245
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,318
kmd was barely circulating um cam 91 was

1246
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,199
almost not circulating at that time but

1247
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:18,318
a few people had it but jesus was in

1248
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,559
circulation and uh i remember when bodhi

1249
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,639
gave that to me i thought wow this is

1250
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,440
supposed to be mass super skunk and chem

1251
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,279
d i and i loved that cut but i always

1252
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,400
thought what would it be like with chem

1253
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,720
91 so when i saw the super dog inside

1254
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,880
that can of bible that became one of my

1255
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,719
white whales my white whales and it

1256
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,800
still is it still is one of my white

1257
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:39,919
whales because i still haven't found it

1258
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,359
um

1259
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,519
yeah but that's that was my first

1260
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,480
experience with the super dog

1261
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,559
seeing it

1262
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,039
looking for it i eventually

1263
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,599
uh i think it was a diesel crossed to

1264
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,759
the chem dog dnl

1265
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,838
and i named that superdog 2010. now this

1266
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,480
is long before we were friends but it

1267
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,239
was just so funny um when we did meet

1268
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,199
each other and became friends to find

1269
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,559
out

1270
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,039
i was friends with the guy who created

1271
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,119
one of my white whales

1272
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,199
yeah i mean you know the farther you go

1273
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,400
back in cannabis it really is kind of a

1274
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,679
small community

1275
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,358
you know in that regard and um

1276
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,000
you know i used to joke that you're only

1277
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,239
like three hippies removed from anyone

1278
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,239
uh

1279
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,719
you know and it really yeah i mean back

1280
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,800
you know like it really

1281
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,719
it really was like um you know uh

1282
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,318
it kind of now it's spread out there's

1283
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,118
all kinds of people doing it all over

1284
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:37,279
the place but um back then it was

1285
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,039
riskier it was smaller there was only so

1286
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,440
many people involved

1287
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,960
um and you know and on top of that like

1288
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,240
even breeding

1289
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,358
i mean all the breeding that we did

1290
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,598
essentially

1291
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,039
was a labor of love like there was no

1292
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,880
profit margin in it there was no

1293
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,960
american seed companies there was no

1294
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,000
real way to market your seeds

1295
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,679
um anything like that i mean if you were

1296
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,280
if you were trying to

1297
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,639
you know start a seed company you went

1298
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,800
to amsterdam

1299
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,879
absolutely and tried to do it over there

1300
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,039
so really it was like

1301
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,720
um all that breeding was done with

1302
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,318
intent to grow

1303
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,279
better weed

1304
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,199
for our friends and you know and to have

1305
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,680
it there wasn't any

1306
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,759
fame involved there wasn't any money

1307
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,159
involved and in fact it was a money

1308
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,640
loser because obviously back then

1309
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:27,118
prices for herb were extremely high

1310
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:30,799
compared you know uh and so

1311
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,160
blowing off even small rooms of seed um

1312
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,680
that you weren't even gonna make any

1313
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,000
money off of you were just going to hunt

1314
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,598
through yourself

1315
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,119
it was basically a labor of love you

1316
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,720
know there wasn't

1317
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,720
any

1318
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:46,399
there wasn't any intent behind it except

1319
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:48,399
for to try to you know grow better weed

1320
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,240
and be like this strain and this strain

1321
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,639
maybe we can combine them and we can get

1322
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,879
these traits to pop out in one strain

1323
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,318
combined you know

1324
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,000
i think a lot of that is missing and

1325
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,079
this is just my opinion but i think a

1326
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,480
lot of that is missing in today's market

1327
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,760
um obviously times have changed you

1328
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,639
don't have to

1329
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,040
i mean

1330
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:09,920
you never had to but the idea yeah was

1331
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,358
americans went over to amsterdam

1332
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,599
and they started their seed companies

1333
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,519
over there um

1334
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,160
a lot of that has changed to seed prices

1335
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,719
have gone up it's become a market in

1336
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,118
itself to sell seeds to where people are

1337
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,879
getting rich you look at dna you look at

1338
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,519
uh you know a greenhouse any of those

1339
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,280
companies that are mostly seeds

1340
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,239
and to this day you still don't sell

1341
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,200
seeds um so it's very admirable to me

1342
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,199
admirable to me

1343
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,000
but i still think you need to sell seeds

1344
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,440
i mean i don't i don't know like in a

1345
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,880
sense like

1346
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,720
it wasn't so much that um that you know

1347
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,280
i just it just wasn't even it just

1348
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,000
wasn't even feasible back then really it

1349
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,319
didn't seem like it was possible or yeah

1350
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,400
american seed prices were what 20 bucks

1351
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:57,920
a pack if you knew someone something

1352
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,800
like that it was it was a way different

1353
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,519
world

1354
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,720
to be perfectly honest uh while i never

1355
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,519
thought that way

1356
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,799
my buddy that we did the that i did the

1357
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:07,679
project with

1358
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,160
he

1359
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,960
he saw what could be coming and he had

1360
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,838
this idea that um

1361
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,679
you know if we made rooms full of seed

1362
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,759
that you could actually produce way more

1363
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,159
seed in that room than you could ever

1364
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,119
produce bud and that you could actually

1365
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:28,719
do really well with seed and his

1366
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:31,519
intention uh at some point was to

1367
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,919
flip it around and start selling some

1368
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,559
seed but it was really like it was

1369
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,318
really too early people weren't into it

1370
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,079
people didn't want it we tried to move

1371
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,279
it to friends and things like that at

1372
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,920
the time

1373
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,720
and uh you know at that era people just

1374
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,039
wanted dependable clones

1375
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,719
that would sell for high dollar and they

1376
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,519
didn't most people didn't want to do

1377
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:55,199
hunting um they didn't wanna

1378
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,199
you know they didn't want to put in the

1379
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,799
time they just wanted to get a plant

1380
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,519
that was going to

1381
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,880
work for them and move it on and so we

1382
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,318
did a bunch of this stuff and it was

1383
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,760
kind of like

1384
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,519
i don't want to say it was ahead of its

1385
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,839
time but you could just say that the

1386
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,920
market perhaps wasn't quite as receptive

1387
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,799
or ready and that there wasn't a

1388
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,400
distribution channel um

1389
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,640
like the internet and stuff like that

1390
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,480
that made it easy to do that

1391
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,318
i was just doing it because i wanted to

1392
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,079
create

1393
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,279
better weed to smoke for myself and

1394
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,039
friends

1395
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,960
but my buddy from staten island he

1396
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,519
actually kind of

1397
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,400
he did see what was coming although we

1398
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,519
were years away from actually making it

1399
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,079
work where

1400
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,318
he realized that like one day

1401
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,880
um you know seeds could be extremely

1402
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,719
popular in america

1403
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,039
and that there'd be a demand for them

1404
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,959
and that you know off a six or an eight

1405
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,279
or a ten ten lighter you could actually

1406
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,599
make way way more seeds than you could

1407
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,599
ever make as far as um

1408
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,720
producing flower for sale or anything

1409
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,838
like that

1410
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:02,239
um and uh but honestly

1411
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:05,358
um the world really wasn't ready at that

1412
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,199
particular moment you know they uh

1413
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,838
it was really the height of like certain

1414
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,598
clones fetch top dollar and so the vast

1415
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,599
majority of your friends just wanted to

1416
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,599
run those clones because it was

1417
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,359
consistent it was easy

1418
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,400
most people didn't want to hunt back

1419
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:19,759
then

1420
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,000
um

1421
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,800
you know and that type of thing and so

1422
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,318
he

1423
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,559
he was a little ahead of his time in

1424
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,119
that regard in terms of like what he saw

1425
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,160
coming i never saw that as much

1426
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,480
um but you know um you know i just

1427
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,639
wanted to create different things that

1428
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,838
friends and i enjoyed to smoke

1429
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:43,039
uh and so what that led to was that

1430
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:45,279
um you know i i've never sold beans or

1431
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,960
anything like that but i've given a

1432
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,599
whole bunch of beans

1433
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,838
and strains i found from those beans

1434
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,359
away to close friends

1435
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,960
and various people and anybody that i

1436
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,558
thought had a good heart

1437
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,639
uh as far as uh you know where they were

1438
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,599
at with herb and that

1439
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,679
um in retrospect because i did that i

1440
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,079
went through some struggles uh and that

1441
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,358
you go through in cannabis at times um

1442
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,119
and

1443
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,558
the only reason why some of this stuff

1444
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,119
exists today

1445
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,720
is because i passed it out

1446
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,200
because i personally ended up losing

1447
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,799
most of it uh through a series of

1448
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,719
unfortunate events

1449
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,000
actually oh god

1450
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:28,639
yeah acts of god police fires various

1451
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,119
different things can occur where you end

1452
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,639
up uh you end up not having what you you

1453
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,599
know i mean it's happened it happened to

1454
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,759
all the guys in amsterdam um it hap it

1455
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,039
happens it happens all the time you know

1456
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,800
uh yeah

1457
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,759
you know people get in trouble people

1458
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,599
get visited things happen fires happen

1459
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,319
ex-girlfriends get angry at you and

1460
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,680
trash your stuff uh all kinds of there's

1461
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,159
all there's all kinds of different

1462
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,480
stories about their out there about how

1463
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:56,639
famous things end up getting lost you

1464
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,480
know and part of the problem is is that

1465
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,159
if you hoard things too tightly then it

1466
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,199
really narrows

1467
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,118
like who has it and um

1468
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,279
you know and then uh

1469
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,519
you know it can be lost permanently yeah

1470
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,599
that's that's always the big catch 22 in

1471
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,960
pickle um

1472
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,640
how much do you really trust someone to

1473
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,679
give them someone something that's

1474
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,440
special how well do you know them yeah

1475
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,118
you know but i mean the thing is is that

1476
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,039
you know back then

1477
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,640
you know we're talking late 90s early

1478
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:29,519
2000s it really was a different era

1479
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,679
in terms of all that like nobody was

1480
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,280
it was all still pretty underground

1481
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,440
nobody was trying to make a name for

1482
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,880
themselves nobody was trying to become

1483
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,400
famous off it

1484
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,559
like i said if you were going to do that

1485
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,400
you would end up moving to amsterdam or

1486
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,160
something along those lines and trying

1487
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,318
to do it on the on the legal or

1488
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,318
semi-legal kick

1489
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,558
nobody was really advertising it was all

1490
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,519
word of mouth and extended friend groups

1491
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,280
you know

1492
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:58,239
yeah um so you know there's uh

1493
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,920
i had a we i had another friend uh

1494
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:04,000
out here at the time and in

1495
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,000
the early 2000s

1496
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,119
he had started to show some interest in

1497
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,159
breeding

1498
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:12,318
um and working some stuff and he was he

1499
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,318
was from up in northern humboldt

1500
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,000
and um

1501
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,318
i hadn't really done that much before

1502
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,039
and i was i had done a bunch of it

1503
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,558
and so um you know we had other inch we

1504
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,838
had other shared interests that we had

1505
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,680
together and

1506
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:28,000
so we were hanging out and he wanted to

1507
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,719
get started and so i ended up giving him

1508
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,039
uh

1509
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,639
a few thousand seeds

1510
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,480
of various things that we had made

1511
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,798
mostly super dog crosses

1512
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,000
and some clones to add to what he

1513
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,000
already had

1514
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,838
um so he could get started and start

1515
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,079
playing around with stuff

1516
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:47,119
and that guy ended up becoming

1517
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,280
relatively famous um especially

1518
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,480
um after he sadly passed and his name's

1519
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,400
mandelbrot

1520
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,519
um but if you

1521
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,720
anything

1522
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,039
um

1523
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,519
anything that he you know i'm not i'll

1524
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,599
just like pre you know preface this by

1525
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,159
saying that like by no means what i'm

1526
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,720
about to say am i claiming a bunch of

1527
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,318
uh mandelbrots like mantle or anything

1528
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:09,838
like that but

1529
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,639
if you look at

1530
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,480
um anything that he did if it has chem

1531
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:15,598
dog super skunk

1532
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,798
maui

1533
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,599
sour

1534
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:21,599
uh a few other things um that all came

1535
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,480
out of seeds that i gifted him

1536
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,798
yes

1537
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,960
you know is basically i gave him a few

1538
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,759
thousand seeds to get started so he

1539
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,358
could hunt and play for things and then

1540
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,480
out of the uh

1541
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:34,719
out of the

1542
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,920
the maui super dog

1543
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,959
um he found that cut called the truth

1544
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,119
um

1545
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,519
you know uh he

1546
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,599
you know so i mean he changed some names

1547
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,159
and stuff so if you see something that

1548
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,599
says amherst super skunk that's the same

1549
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:52,798
super skunk cut

1550
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:55,359
um he spelled chem dog instead of dog he

1551
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,280
spelled the d-a-w-g

1552
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,838
um you know he took a little artistic

1553
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,720
license here and there on on some of it

1554
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,798
um but anything that you see

1555
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,959
that in his stuff that has that as a

1556
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,039
basis um

1557
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,519
that was all stuff that i gifted him you

1558
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,358
know um and then he took those things

1559
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:14,880
and bred with them and crossed them to

1560
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,598
things that he had

1561
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,798
um and made his whole uh emerald

1562
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,880
triangle

1563
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:22,400
um emerald mountain i think was the

1564
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,160
first one that he had

1565
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,440
uh he was doing a bunch of stuff up in

1566
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:26,639
arcata

1567
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,039
um

1568
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:32,000
and uh after he died

1569
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:34,239
um his brother who's a super nice guy

1570
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
um has tried to continue it with emerald

1571
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,279
mountain legacy

1572
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,239
that's right

1573
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,480
yeah and you know sadly when he died um

1574
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,479
it seems like um i don't know who they

1575
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,639
are but a bunch of people seem to have

1576
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,159
raided his mom room and seeds and stuff

1577
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:50,000
like that and so

1578
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,759
there was kind of a free-for-all on who

1579
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,599
got his stuff

1580
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,359
[ __ ] typical

1581
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,880
yeah it kind of got it kind of got you

1582
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,759
know it kind of got a little dicey there

1583
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,760
or whatever but you know he left um

1584
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,960
you know he left four kids behind who

1585
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,720
were pretty young

1586
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:10,240
uh and um one of our mutual friends

1587
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:13,358
obviously uh mean gene uh did a very

1588
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,558
successful auction uh to help out the

1589
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:17,440
kids

1590
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,280
and his brother came out to try to

1591
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,039
continue on what he'd been doing and

1592
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,798
help support the family and stuff like

1593
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,838
that and so

1594
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:24,719
you know

1595
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:27,679
um

1596
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:30,798
you know uh but yeah so as far as

1597
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,480
as far as some of the superdogs stuff um

1598
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,559
it ended up being

1599
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,880
you know it ended up being the basis for

1600
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,040
a significant percentage

1601
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,400
of what mandelbrot ended up breeding

1602
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,639
with and using

1603
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,798
um because i supplied

1604
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:46,558
not everything he had some of his own

1605
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,480
cuts and stuff like that certainly but i

1606
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,200
supplied a number of cuts

1607
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,679
and

1608
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,519
a bunch of seed to get him started on

1609
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:54,639
his breeding projects and so a lot of

1610
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:58,159
what he did

1611
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:01,440
got based off that work that uh

1612
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,519
myself and my buddy from you know

1613
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,400
from staten island did together

1614
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:05,920
you know

1615
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,680
and that's kind of like how things were

1616
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,960
a lot back then i mean anytime i'm

1617
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,440
talking about any kind of breeding

1618
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,159
project whether i mentioned them or not

1619
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,920
i almost almost never back then were you

1620
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,199
doing something alone in your basement

1621
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,960
by yourself

1622
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,519
you always had a buddy who was helping

1623
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,358
you or a partner or you brought the

1624
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,000
strains and you ended up doing it at a

1625
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:28,159
friend's spare bedroom or

1626
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,239
you know i mean there wasn't

1627
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,318
back then nobody cared about rep

1628
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,159
nobody was trying to have ownership we

1629
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,358
were all just trying to like breed on a

1630
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,519
certain level

1631
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:39,279
um and so

1632
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,519
you know um

1633
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,640
you know most most cannabis stuff occurs

1634
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,960
in groups

1635
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,558
you know and that was that was certainly

1636
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,240
true with most of our stuff sometimes it

1637
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,839
might as well just be a helper sometimes

1638
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,598
it was a full partner

1639
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:52,719
sometimes it was someone that like let

1640
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,119
us use

1641
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:57,439
a room or a spot on their hill for a

1642
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,640
project we wanted type of thing

1643
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,079
um

1644
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,279
and so that's how most of that stuff

1645
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,680
went down

1646
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,798
um unfortunately

1647
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,399
you know um you know i uh

1648
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,159
you know mandelbrot got a little bit of

1649
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,318
a an ego

1650
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,679
um about various things and didn't

1651
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,119
really want to like

1652
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,279
once he got a bunch of credit and a

1653
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,039
bunch of fame he didn't really want to

1654
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,720
um

1655
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:22,400
you know he didn't really want to return

1656
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:25,598
certain things that i'd given him after

1657
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,440
i'd lost them in various ways and that

1658
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,280
went on for a few years and we

1659
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,798
eventually patched it up

1660
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,319
and he was gonna make right on

1661
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,079
everything and give me back certain

1662
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,119
things that i had lost that he still

1663
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,559
held

1664
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,318
but sadly he you know uh he had a sudden

1665
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,599
and unexpected death

1666
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,039
and so that never really came to

1667
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,559
fruition

1668
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,599
um so

1669
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,240
uh

1670
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,079
through a series of unfortunate events

1671
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,879
myself and

1672
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:55,519
my buddy and some others we all lost the

1673
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,559
superdog plants and lines

1674
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,798
um

1675
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,680
but they're not totally lost because

1676
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,358
tons of people have ran his work

1677
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:06,159
and so they exist

1678
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,000
in that form all over the place

1679
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,920
yeah i still have this mystery cut here

1680
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,239
called the truth that may or may not be

1681
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,280
from him

1682
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:17,759
yeah i mean that you know um so i mean

1683
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,559
that's that's really like i mean to me

1684
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,319
it's

1685
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,079
it's like that's i mean we've talked

1686
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:23,838
about it before but i have like a few

1687
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,400
things in terms of what i think makes

1688
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:28,239
you a good breeder or not you know let's

1689
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,960
go

1690
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:34,239
well i mean i think for for one thing i

1691
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,199
think the most important part is that

1692
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,439
you know

1693
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:39,439
can your can your breeding can your

1694
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,519
breeding produce elites

1695
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,679
and what i mean by elite i mean right

1696
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,519
now you know with mark modern marketing

1697
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:48,078
and stuff like that coming into cannabis

1698
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:51,280
uh everybody has elites everybody has

1699
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,240
rare amazing fantastic killer genetics

1700
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,960
right but in the in the old days what

1701
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,798
became an elite was like enough growers

1702
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,199
enough heads

1703
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,358
smoked it and thought it was worthy

1704
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,879
enough to be

1705
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:06,558
something that was

1706
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,920
highly desirable

1707
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,559
and that's how

1708
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,480
all the old elites became elites

1709
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,798
was that not everybody had to agree that

1710
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,318
it was the bomb but enough people agreed

1711
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,480
that it was the bomb and it was

1712
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:21,358
desirable and that it had

1713
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,159
whether it was its terpenes or its its

1714
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:26,400
potency or its effect or its growth or

1715
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:27,920
you know some combination thereof

1716
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,920
um

1717
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,680
you know that's how that's how

1718
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,358
all the name strains that we like to

1719
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:36,798
collect got named and got popular right

1720
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,199
so

1721
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:42,000
you know and so there's some people

1722
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,838
out there you know and so like

1723
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,559
you know i don't even care if your lines

1724
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:49,279
produce a bunch of garbage to be honest

1725
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,079
as long as it's possible to produce

1726
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,359
elites out of your line you know because

1727
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,200
i mean let's face it like we're

1728
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,880
essentially trying to do

1729
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:57,838
we're essentially looking for lebron

1730
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,280
james

1731
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:01,838
yes right

1732
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,519
or a supermodel or you know something

1733
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,480
along those lines you're looking for a

1734
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:09,038
rare combination of traits right richard

1735
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,798
simmons exactly yeah you know and and

1736
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,559
it's like so obviously like in the in

1737
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,400
the line itself

1738
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,798
you're only going to find those

1739
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,318
superstars every once in a while

1740
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:20,159
otherwise they wouldn't be elite you

1741
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:22,480
know when people like say a keeper in

1742
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:24,399
every pack you know i mean that to me

1743
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,240
just means that like

1744
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,200
you could have a high floor but a low

1745
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,038
ceiling

1746
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,519
correct where you find something that's

1747
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,280
reasonably decent in most packs

1748
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,519
but you don't find very much that's

1749
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,839
that's so i would prefer to have a low

1750
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,679
floor and a high ceiling

1751
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,159
where i think that's what tom hill went

1752
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:44,399
for too like with the haze and whatnot

1753
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:45,679
well yeah i mean the hazes especially so

1754
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,519
the haze

1755
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:48,960
you know i mean obviously you know um

1756
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:50,318
we've talked about this a bunch in

1757
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,760
private but like

1758
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,920
there's a reason why there's so many

1759
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,319
hazes that are 30 plus years old that

1760
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,599
are still carefully held onto

1761
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:59,519
sure um

1762
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,200
but even those guys that had access to

1763
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,159
tons of seed they had to go through a

1764
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,399
ton

1765
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:06,399
to find what they wanted

1766
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,160
yeah the metric ass ton

1767
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,880
yeah i mean and so

1768
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:12,399
you know it's there's a bunch of i don't

1769
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,160
want to say the word garbage but there's

1770
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,599
a bunch of stuff that you wouldn't pick

1771
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,639
for yourself

1772
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,400
because it's too much jungle weed uh in

1773
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,679
some of that stuff and so

1774
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,119
you know i mean there's certain seed

1775
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,279
companies out there

1776
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,440
that have sold literally millions of

1777
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,960
dollars in seed

1778
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,720
and i and they don't have nobody is

1779
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,559
trading cuts

1780
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:36,078
of theirs at all

1781
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,960
yeah over

1782
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,839
you know

1783
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,358
decades of over decades and it's not

1784
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:43,119
like every once in a while people don't

1785
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:44,639
find nice things in there that they hold

1786
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,720
on to but like

1787
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:48,639
you know so it's like if if someone has

1788
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:50,959
gone through tons of your work and

1789
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,838
nothing has popped up

1790
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
right

1791
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:57,519
that ends up being that way in my in my

1792
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,880
opinion that's kind of a failure yeah

1793
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,798
which is okay because it's like

1794
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,798
breathing is mostly failure yeah it

1795
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,519
should be if for someone with a

1796
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:08,000
discerning eye and uh with enough

1797
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,079
experience it should be mostly failures

1798
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,760
yeah and sometimes you know sometimes

1799
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,839
you just don't get what you want most of

1800
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,520
the time you know um so that's kind of

1801
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:18,000
the first thing is like

1802
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:20,318
you know like i don't so for me it's

1803
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,199
like i don't really mind if

1804
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:25,038
you get junk or bunk i mean i used to go

1805
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,639
and i mean we could talk about this at

1806
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,720
different at different points but i mean

1807
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,239
i would make you know multiple trips a

1808
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:31,439
year to amsterdam and buy a bunch of

1809
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,639
seed

1810
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,440
right yeah

1811
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:35,440
and

1812
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,280
you know there's things i bought from

1813
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,200
neville or scentsy or whatever that i

1814
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,079
never found jack [ __ ] that was worth

1815
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,798
anything

1816
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:45,519
yep but then there's other people

1817
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,358
that in that exact same line found

1818
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,599
highly desirable keepers that have been

1819
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,719
kept alive for a long last time

1820
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,039
very true

1821
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,639
you know and one of the mistakes that i

1822
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,880
made back then was i would go over there

1823
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:58,719
and i would buy like two packs of like

1824
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,039
15 different things

1825
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:03,038
yeah when when older me would have been

1826
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,119
like i'm gonna go buy two or three

1827
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,440
things and i'm gonna buy 50 or 80 seeds

1828
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,280
of each thing yeah

1829
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,880
and really try to deep dive but you go

1830
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,000
over there you get all excited you know

1831
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,838
you're like i'm gonna get this i'm gonna

1832
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,480
get this i'm gonna get this i didn't

1833
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,599
really understand as well as i do now

1834
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,119
like

1835
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,920
you know it's much better to try to go

1836
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,680
through 30 40 50 60 females than it

1837
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,519
would be to get eight

1838
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,838
sure because what are your chances of

1839
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:30,239
finding a supermodel or lebron james and

1840
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,078
eight females you know any any

1841
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,679
geneticist or breeder would laugh at you

1842
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,798
if you had that small of a selection

1843
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:36,960
pool

1844
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:39,119
yeah i think most breeders outside of

1845
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,679
the cannabis community looking in like

1846
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,720
readers that are uh in agriculture tend

1847
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:47,358
to think what we do and how generally

1848
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:48,798
speaking as far as like uh

1849
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,960
seed companies and whatnot they think

1850
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:54,159
it's silly that we would even consider

1851
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,760
f1s f1s nowadays

1852
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:58,318
yeah but i mean at the same point when

1853
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,680
you're growing corn like you know 50 000

1854
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:02,079
corn starch aren't going to get you

1855
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:03,199
lifetime in federal prison that's very

1856
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,960
very true

1857
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:07,038
so yeah i mean obviously there's like

1858
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,679
the luther burbank thing of pic pick the

1859
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,400
best and ditch the rest yeah but when

1860
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:14,318
you have severe legal penalties in many

1861
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,440
states that are based specifically on

1862
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:16,318
numbers

1863
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,960
you know

1864
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,318
um you know genetics is a numbers game

1865
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,119
it sure is right

1866
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:25,038
and so you know and and all that and so

1867
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:29,039
um i actually think we've been able to

1868
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:31,440
do an amazing amount of positive work um

1869
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,039
in the 90s and early 2000s based on

1870
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:37,039
garages and things of that nature

1871
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,119
so you know the second thing i would

1872
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,960
think is beyond the ability to throw

1873
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,200
elites is

1874
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,960
um do other breeders want to take your

1875
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:48,000
work and work with it

1876
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,159
that's super super important to me as a

1877
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,760
legacy type thing that that should be

1878
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,519
what we all strive for

1879
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,520
because really eventually everybody's

1880
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,599
going to be forgotten sure um you know

1881
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,440
one of the the first podcast you did i

1882
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,200
wonder if you did a poll

1883
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,639
how many people even knew who seattle

1884
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,399
greg was

1885
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,558
you know

1886
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,280
not very many really but he is one of

1887
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,599
the most important founding people in

1888
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,000
cannabis in in that regard you know

1889
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,480
absolutely um you know so everybody gets

1890
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,279
forgotten dude you know so it's really

1891
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,479
like

1892
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,159
you know the thing that won't get

1893
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,838
forgotten even if they have no idea who

1894
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,759
you are is that if you improve the

1895
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,399
cannabis gene pool

1896
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,119
if you create plants and you create you

1897
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,960
know elites and stuff like that that

1898
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:31,920
other people end up using and breeding

1899
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,838
with

1900
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,119
then you know you made a lasting

1901
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,359
contribution

1902
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,039
that's a legacy because people might

1903
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,440
have no idea who he is but they're

1904
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:44,238
growing nl poly hybrids they might not

1905
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,000
even realize that there's nl in there

1906
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,838
but they are

1907
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,920
you know and so

1908
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,238
he made a lasting contribution to the

1909
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,199
gene pool

1910
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,198
that exists for decades after he quit

1911
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,278
you know

1912
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,198
and so i you know that

1913
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,040
you know being able to find elites in

1914
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,719
your stuff is one

1915
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,560
two is other people

1916
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,399
thinking highly enough of your work to

1917
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,679
want to use it in their own work and

1918
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,439
continue on with that stuff you know yep

1919
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:16,000
and three is kind of a silly one because

1920
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,759
it's all ego but three is if people want

1921
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,359
to steal your work and rename it and

1922
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,399
claim it as their own

1923
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:23,920
uh then they really like it yeah

1924
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,838
exactly because now they want it to be a

1925
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,679
part of their legacy they they would

1926
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:31,600
they would like to steal your legacy and

1927
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,279
you know and then make it their own and

1928
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,798
get the credit and get the fame and get

1929
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,880
the whatever from your stuff so

1930
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:38,560
obviously if they're trying to do that

1931
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,480
then whether or not they give you the

1932
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,920
credit or not they secretly think quite

1933
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,519
highly of your work

1934
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,838
absolutely and

1935
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,600
you know and so i mean i obviously like

1936
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:48,798
you know you were in you were in music

1937
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,560
for you know

1938
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,158
for a while and stuff and it's kind of

1939
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,679
like breeding is kind of like the music

1940
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,158
industry like there's lots of talent

1941
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,600
that never gets recognized sure there's

1942
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,879
lots of talent that never makes any

1943
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,760
money

1944
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,199
you know

1945
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,840
um so if your goal is like is social

1946
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:09,519
recognition and money um most of the

1947
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,520
time you're going to be disappointed

1948
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,440
in that regard and there's lots of

1949
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,678
people that did a ton of good work you

1950
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,519
know and lasting impacts

1951
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,960
that you know we're at the you know i

1952
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,360
mean look at you know look at look at

1953
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,000
all the the 80s hip-hop none of those

1954
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,000
guys made any money but fast forward 15

1955
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,359
years and the next generation of hip-hop

1956
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,279
some of those guys are worth hundreds of

1957
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,679
millions of dollars now

1958
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:33,039
you know so it really is like what era

1959
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,920
you came up in

1960
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:35,679
you know

1961
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,000
uh you know neville

1962
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,199
probably died pretty broke

1963
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,238
yeah um

1964
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:45,519
and uh right definitely did

1965
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,718
you know he never really he never really

1966
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,400
uh

1967
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,560
um

1968
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:53,359
he never really benefited

1969
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,199
uh in that regard in my opinion um you

1970
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:57,279
know most of his money went to legal

1971
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:58,879
fees yeah you know he never he didn't

1972
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,559
end up like arjun from the greenhouse

1973
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,640
where he was worth millions of dollars

1974
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,719
and had stable this and investments or

1975
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,119
anything like that like he was enough of

1976
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,560
a pioneer that he actually spent chunks

1977
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,559
of time in jail

1978
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,239
and had the dea trying to put him into

1979
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,560
prison for the rest of his life and he

1980
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,639
got [ __ ] over by business partners and

1981
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,640
i mean some of that obviously like i

1982
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,840
mean he had his own personal demons and

1983
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,119
struggles and stuff but sure um but he

1984
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,199
also was one of the most important

1985
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:27,679
people in cannabis but he didn't you

1986
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:30,879
know he got he got notoriety and fame

1987
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:34,158
based on it you know yeah um but because

1988
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:37,039
america has this this rename game

1989
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,639
where we give nicknames to weed based on

1990
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:41,039
cultural stuff

1991
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,640
it kind of like a lot of a lot of stuff

1992
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,640
that's neville's

1993
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,119
uh people don't even know

1994
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,840
because because it gets a name like

1995
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:51,119
electric boogaloo or it gets a name like

1996
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,600
you know

1997
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,599
dumpster or it gets a name like if or it

1998
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,560
gets a name like you know

1999
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,320
absolutely

2000
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,239
you know and some of those things you

2001
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:02,000
know it gets lost to time what they

2002
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:04,319
originally were

2003
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
you know and sometimes those strain

2004
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,960
names change again

2005
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,880
based on what crew they go to you know

2006
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,359
and so that happens a few times and so

2007
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,359
you really have to have a good you know

2008
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:18,238
get some luck and some history and some

2009
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,559
digging to find out like what what

2010
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:22,238
things are you know

2011
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,320
and so all that kind of stuff gets lost

2012
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:26,158
to time so for me

2013
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,799
it really is like

2014
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:30,960
breeding is like what you ca what you

2015
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,880
what you add to the gene pool

2016
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,399
because then eventually other people are

2017
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,440
going to be smoking good weed that you

2018
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:39,920
had some small hand in creating or

2019
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:41,599
making better or adding that it gets out

2020
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,719
there you know

2021
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,360
i mean yeah

2022
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:48,560
because i uh you know in that same

2023
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:52,158
instance that um you know i lost some of

2024
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:54,800
the the i lost my my super dog lines i

2025
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:56,879
lost the mother cutting of the mendo p

2026
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,000
the mendo perps for a number of years

2027
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,520
yep um but because i shared it i got it

2028
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,479
back

2029
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,280
you know

2030
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:07,919
and um you know i did some breeding with

2031
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:10,800
it and some of those things are in some

2032
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,440
pretty famous things right now and um

2033
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,360
but i mean our mutual friend csi i don't

2034
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,359
think anybody has done more

2035
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:19,119
like he's the one that made sure that

2036
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,439
the mendo p and its genetics are

2037
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:23,119
permanently in the gene pool

2038
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,119
yes

2039
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:26,880
he's bred with it so much

2040
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:28,559
and he's added it to so many different

2041
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,159
things and so many people have bought

2042
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,280
his seedlines

2043
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:32,879
that

2044
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:34,719
he's really the person that made it a

2045
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,199
permanent addition

2046
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,319
you know and he makes a perfect example

2047
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:42,000
of of the difference between uh you know

2048
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:45,119
someone that's been doing it for a long

2049
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,039
time does it write every time not not to

2050
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,079
say he doesn't have failures but he he

2051
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:50,319
does

2052
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:51,439
what a real breeder should yet he's not

2053
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,319
one of these

2054
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:56,559
mega famous you know multi-billionaire

2055
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,039
millionaire [ __ ] aryans

2056
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,280
no i mean all right you know that's the

2057
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,920
thing about ariane is that like he ended

2058
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,880
up

2059
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,158
in a perfect space and time you know he

2060
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,840
really did

2061
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,559
there really there really is something

2062
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,679
to that where it's like he got shanti

2063
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,239
and neville

2064
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:16,319
to form greenhouse with him you know

2065
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:18,959
yeah um and then they brought their

2066
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,519
genetics and their famous cuts and all

2067
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,880
that and then you know he won they won a

2068
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,760
bunch of cups

2069
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:28,000
back when like the high times coming out

2070
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:31,199
of what what was winning cups was like a

2071
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,800
really big deal sure you know and so the

2072
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:35,039
amount of americans and the amount of

2073
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,360
people that would go to amsterdam and go

2074
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:40,319
to greenhouse and buy weed and smoke

2075
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:42,960
weed from greenhouse and then buy seeds

2076
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:46,158
made him extremely wealthy

2077
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,158
you know um but he was i mean he he was

2078
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:49,519
the business side of it and that and

2079
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,920
that's you know that's like a whole

2080
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,000
other interesting topic of like

2081
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,640
the and it's happening now in america

2082
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,198
where it's like um in the 90s it's

2083
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,440
really like uh you can really learn a

2084
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:02,238
lot from watching what happened

2085
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,000
in

2086
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:07,599
um in amsterdam then where the breeders

2087
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,319
and the people with the passion for the

2088
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,920
plant and all that ended up melding with

2089
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,960
the money

2090
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,920
you know

2091
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,840
and

2092
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,399
you know uh it wasn't always the

2093
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,119
happiest marriage you know uh

2094
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:22,238
i mean obviously like you know going um

2095
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,559
you know

2096
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,198
uh neville had his seed bank

2097
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,600
right yeah if he doesn't get if he

2098
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:30,960
doesn't get caught up in operation green

2099
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,039
merchant

2100
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,760
and spend a year in jail

2101
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:38,719
he probably never partners with

2102
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,239
ben and alan drunkers from scentsy seeds

2103
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,640
without a doubt and he would have never

2104
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,639
sold his stock to shanti he never would

2105
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,119
have he never well he never would have

2106
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,520
given his stock to the to scentsy yeah

2107
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:51,519
exactly he went he went from owning the

2108
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,719
biggest most successful seed bank in

2109
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,800
holland

2110
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,520
to being the head breeder

2111
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,159
of somebody else's seed bank yep

2112
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,400
and then sensei ended up trademarking a

2113
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:03,679
bunch of the names or even changing a

2114
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:05,198
bunch of the names so they could

2115
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,199
trademark them

2116
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:10,079
and so he ended up having to sell out to

2117
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,839
business people right yep and then

2118
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,279
lost control of a bunch of his own

2119
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,199
genetics

2120
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:18,079
and then when shanti and him went to

2121
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:21,759
work with arjun because he learned from

2122
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:24,559
that right they never let arjun have any

2123
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,880
of the moms or the dads or the seeds or

2124
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,719
the herb or the cuts

2125
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,560
they would they would grow

2126
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,158
and they would provide the flour and

2127
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,280
they would provide the seeds to

2128
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:35,519
greenhouse

2129
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,800
but they were very well aware that if

2130
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,679
they allowed

2131
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,679
you know

2132
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,600
the if they allowed him to get a hold of

2133
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,800
it that he could just cut them out

2134
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,480
yeah and they probably knew his

2135
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,000
personality too

2136
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,399
well because that's that's essentially

2137
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,399
what it what happened to you know

2138
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,319
scentsy seeds ended up owning most of

2139
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,079
neville's work yep

2140
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:56,559
from the seed bank

2141
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,399
you know and you know and so he didn't

2142
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,640
want that to happen again

2143
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,119
and so you know there's always been this

2144
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,760
push between the people doing the real

2145
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,760
work and then those people don't tend to

2146
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,440
come from money and then the people you

2147
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,079
have to bond with that actually come

2148
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:12,879
from money and that like that tension

2149
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:14,238
there

2150
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,119
sure

2151
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:17,439
and

2152
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:20,079
you know there's people in cannabis that

2153
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,599
are in it for the plant and you know

2154
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:22,880
they want to make a living obviously and

2155
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,640
be comfortable

2156
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,960
um and you know and they have this

2157
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,719
desire and then there's people that are

2158
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,880
into monetizing it

2159
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,679
and their primary interest

2160
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,000
is monetization of what they have

2161
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,158
and we deal with that all the time

2162
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,198
in america right now i mean there's a

2163
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,839
huge

2164
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:44,238
there's a huge push to that right sure

2165
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,679
yeah and the one thing that holds true

2166
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:47,198
that i'm learning

2167
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,279
is that most of the guys that are in it

2168
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,879
for the monetization one of their first

2169
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,319
moves is to get someone else to make

2170
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,480
their seats for them

2171
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,960
yeah or or just you know they have a

2172
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:59,759
story of how they came across

2173
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,679
the elite stuff that made them famous

2174
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,520
but it's not as good of a marketing

2175
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,800
story as they would prefer

2176
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,800
yeah exactly

2177
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,039
so they come up with these lies and this

2178
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,119
marketing story where they just kind of

2179
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:13,519
make it up along the fly

2180
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:16,319
and then you have various forum posts or

2181
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,320
various videos of them different eras

2182
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,920
where it's hard to keep track of what

2183
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,000
they said when

2184
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,560
and there's a small percentage of us

2185
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,399
that are you know nerd out on that kind

2186
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,520
of stuff and abel are able to piece

2187
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,519
together

2188
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,040
like what was really going on but i mean

2189
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,440
you know there was a lot of years there

2190
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:35,039
where a bunch of people buying cookie

2191
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:36,319
thought that burner was hand watering

2192
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:38,319
their cookie

2193
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:40,960
yeah they sure did i mean they really

2194
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,559
did like yeah you know and that's a

2195
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,119
testament to

2196
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,600
burner's marketing capability

2197
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:50,399
and his ability to like you know

2198
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,679
push fame and push things and you know i

2199
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:55,279
mean they really

2200
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:58,079
like cookie was cookie was primed

2201
01:18:55,279 --> 01:19:00,399
to be because it's so visually pretty

2202
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:01,359
you know yeah it really was perfectly

2203
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:02,399
suited

2204
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:06,719
for

2205
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:08,238
the instagram and the in the in that era

2206
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,399
it really was and then and they were

2207
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:11,919
timing for it and they did a really good

2208
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:14,879
job of

2209
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:17,760
marketing it and hyping it and

2210
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,640
pushing it and you know they they stole

2211
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,520
names from girl scout cookies and

2212
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,640
you know thin mint and they use

2213
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,480
but you know i mean that's the thing

2214
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,640
that's why that's why the girl scout

2215
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,879
cookies push back is because

2216
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:34,400
marketing and brand name recognition

2217
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,199
people spend enormous sums

2218
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,439
right

2219
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:39,439
like developing that kind of stuff

2220
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,279
especially the girl scouts

2221
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,198
yeah you know and so

2222
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,039
i mean they you know they that's why

2223
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,960
they went from girl scout cookies just

2224
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,319
to cookies

2225
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,679
right because they would have been sued

2226
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,000
into oblivion

2227
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:54,000
about it right you know yeah and you

2228
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,960
know but he they took

2229
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,880
you know

2230
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,880
cannabis really wasn't ready for modern

2231
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,560
marketing techniques

2232
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,880
you know and so we were super

2233
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,800
susceptible to these kind of modern

2234
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,159
marketing techniques where

2235
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,520
i mean you know

2236
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:09,039
obviously you and i you know you get

2237
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,239
into a bunch of trouble

2238
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:14,479
um because you poke holes in people's

2239
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:15,359
[ __ ] all the time publicly right

2240
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:16,879
yeah

2241
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,198
and you know you have your method of

2242
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,600
doing it i i you know i i would choose a

2243
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,759
slightly different method but

2244
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,039
but you have your method of doing it but

2245
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,119
for them

2246
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,800
you're attacking their money

2247
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,599
that's exactly what it like they don't

2248
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,880
give a flying [ __ ] about the truth

2249
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,480
right they care about their image and

2250
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,239
how much money they're making and so

2251
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,718
they view it as a direct assault on

2252
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,359
their pocketbook and their rep

2253
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,119
which is super important to them yeah so

2254
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,439
you're coming at it from a

2255
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,479
from a history point of view

2256
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:50,799
right

2257
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,839
and you know they're coming at it from

2258
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,000
uh like why are you messing with my game

2259
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,360
it's just marketing bro

2260
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,560
right you know and they're just trying

2261
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:00,559
to make it in the world and they're just

2262
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,280
trying to sell their stuff and

2263
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:06,480
you know and it's like you know and

2264
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:08,880
and they felt like the happy accident or

2265
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:11,039
you know how many people like claim

2266
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,199
you know uh how many people over the

2267
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:15,279
years have claimed the origin of a

2268
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:17,359
strain just because they were the first

2269
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:21,039
one to like get out there and lay claim

2270
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:22,399
to it oh sure all the time all the time

2271
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:24,399
right and then you find out that they

2272
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:25,839
were just gifted it early on and the

2273
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:27,679
other people that gifted it to him

2274
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,000
wanted to remain anonymous

2275
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:32,000
and they realized they didn't have to

2276
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,079
and so then a ton of people end up

2277
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,399
associating that with them

2278
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,960
and they end up demanding percentages if

2279
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:41,119
other seed breeders use their work

2280
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,480
or they sell the cut for high dollar or

2281
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:43,359
they do all these various different

2282
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:45,039
things

2283
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:46,479
and really

2284
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:48,800
like they just got they were just in the

2285
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:51,119
first handful of people that got it

2286
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,920
and yeah decided to market it in that

2287
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,359
sense

2288
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,800
that's how uh

2289
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:56,479
katsu's name got

2290
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,000
attached to bubba permanently someone

2291
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,000
gave him that cut

2292
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,840
but he distributed it his name's a part

2293
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,079
of it now he started a company

2294
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,000
yeah you know and i mean i you know i'm

2295
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,079
not i'm not trying to like

2296
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,560
you know necessarily like call out

2297
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:12,719
individual people but obviously that's

2298
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,560
super common yeah you know and there's

2299
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,480
nothing negative on him it's just that's

2300
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,520
how people's names quickly get attached

2301
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:20,559
to something

2302
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:23,280
yeah i mean you know uh my buddy our

2303
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,400
buddy he never he never attempted to do

2304
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:28,079
this but literally because skunkier was

2305
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,839
the first person to get on the forums

2306
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:31,519
and start talking about the chem dog

2307
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,560
extensively

2308
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,400
there's a bunch of people that call it

2309
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,960
the skunk va cut

2310
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:40,319
actually in canada they just released a

2311
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,319
line um the canadian health whatever

2312
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,519

2314
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,159
he never he never played that game of

2315
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:52,399
trying to like lay claim and honest you

2316
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:54,238
know i mean we've obviously with his

2317
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,839
with his interviews and stuff like that

2318
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:59,119
um he's been extremely upfront and

2319
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:01,199
honest about how it all went down but

2320
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:02,479
just because that was his handle on the

2321
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:04,719
forums

2322
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:07,519
and he was the one dropping information

2323
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,639
about it it got a label associated with

2324
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,480
him

2325
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:12,639
yeah i mean that's

2326
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:13,759
when we all amongst our crew we all call

2327
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,840
it the dog

2328
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,600
yes right that leads to internet

2329
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,520
confusion like nobody's business so it's

2330
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,079
got to be the skunk va cut or it's got

2331
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:24,159
to be the chem 91 or it's got to be the

2332
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,840
chem dog 91 you know it has to have a

2333
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:26,879
label that makes sense

2334
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,199
for people

2335
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,279
and it better not have a and w in the

2336
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:34,319
middle of dog

2337
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,840
yeah you know and then you know and so

2338
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:38,000
but you know i mean that's a thing where

2339
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,319
it's like he wasn't even he wasn't even

2340
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,238
remotely trying to

2341
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:43,039
but it still got associated with his

2342
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:44,000
name

2343
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:45,760
sure you know

2344
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,520
like just because people needed a way to

2345
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,159
talk about it

2346
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,639
right which cut oh the one that skunked

2347
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:55,119
the skunk va has yeah you know

2348
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,719
and then other people took that you know

2349
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,279
took different cuts that they had and

2350
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:01,039
tried to actually like lay claim

2351
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,279
you know and then they never thought

2352
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:04,960
that information would come out later

2353
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:06,319
that would like put them in a bad light

2354
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,158
but then eventually it does and then

2355
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:09,679
they're like oops

2356
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:11,039
you know

2357
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,800
but they're not going to like refund

2358
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,960
anybody's money or any other thing that

2359
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,320
they did when like they insisted that

2360
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,439
you had to give them x amount of

2361
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:18,238
percentage

2362
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:20,559
for

2363
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:25,638
the the right to breed with their cut or

2364
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,639
to sell their cut or they just monetized

2365
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:42,760
coming to you from the dark scary slimy

2366
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,760
place

2367
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,439

confusing of another name sure is you

2404
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,880

headbands and what got named headband is

2406
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:18,400
right up there with sauer

2407
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:20,639
uh as being uh not poorly understood you

2408
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:22,799
know not well understood not not very

2409
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,440
well sourced in terms of like

2410
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,840
i mean to take a step back for a minute

2411
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:30,719
uh just to use it as an example we're

2412
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:33,279
really blessed in the sense that

2413
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:35,840
you know chem dog pops a seed

2414
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:38,158
it becomes what we call the dog he gives

2415
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,319
it to my buddy from staten island dude

2416
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:44,319
drives it out he gives it to

2417
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:46,238
gunk va and i see and myself right and

2418
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:48,559
so there's a chain there's a chain of

2419
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:51,279
hands where you know when it was popped

2420
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,039
by who who gave it to who it never got

2421
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:54,319
lost that's it

2422
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,920
right

2423
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:58,799
and

2424
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,440
lots of stuff like this isn't very clear

2425
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,600
like we have no idea who first named

2426
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,439
headband headband yeah no too many

2427
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,760
people take claim for that we don't know

2428
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:10,000
who the first headband cut was

2429
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,840
sure don't we don't exactly know what

2430
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,920
the first headband cut that was named

2431
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,600
headband was even made up of

2432
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:19,199
we don't even know if it had anything to

2433
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:22,000
do with diesel or kim the first headband

2434
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:23,919
you know and so now i mean i will say

2435
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,439
that you know so we can segue into the

2436
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,639
la cush so

2437
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:29,039
um

2438
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:32,400
this is kind of a funny story is that

2439
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,439
um when i gave all those clones and all

2440
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:34,719
those

2441
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:36,799
um

2442
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:39,198
all you know i gave a series of clones

2443
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,920
and a few thousand seeds to mandelbrot

2444
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:44,079
and he was just getting into growing and

2445
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:47,119
he had a few things he had the train

2446
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:49,439
wreck and he had a few different things

2447
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,198
and he had this sour diesel

2448
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,238
that was different than the sour diesel

2449
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:54,479
that i had

2450
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,399
right yeah and so we traded we were

2451
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:57,519
supposed to trade sour diesels

2452
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:59,519
okay

2453
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,120
and so he's like well these he only had

2454
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,719
like literally i think he had three or

2455
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:03,760
four cuts that he was holding on to at

2456
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:05,840
that point

2457
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,800
and um

2458
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,239
he

2459
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,480
um so he's like i'm gonna give you a

2460
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,399
couple of these headbands and a couple

2461
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:15,839
of these sour diesel cuts

2462
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:16,879
right yeah um and so he brings me four

2463
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,279
cuts

2464
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:21,359
and he's like i forgot to label them

2465
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:23,519
but two of them are sour diesel and two

2466
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:25,279
of them are the headband

2467
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,320
right yeah

2468
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:28,559
and so

2469
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:30,319
i get these cuts and i label them all

2470
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,400
carefully and i mom them up and i take

2471
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:34,079
clones off each one of them and i flower

2472
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:35,839
all of them you know

2473
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,519
and i can't tell them apart for anything

2474
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,119
dude

2475
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,520

2476
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,920
i'm bringing friends by my grow room

2477
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,360
nobody can tell them apart you know

2478
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,600
yeah and

2479
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:48,880
and they all just look the same to me

2480
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,320
i'm like but only two of them are

2481
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,079
supposed to be sour and two of them are

2482
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:54,000

2485
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:01,519
is a very early 2000s right yeah so sour

2486
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:03,039
wasn't even like very well known then

2487
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,480
either yeah you know

2488
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:07,600
it was just starting to make its way on

2489
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:09,279
the west coast i mean sour was popped in

2490
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,480
95

2491
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:12,800

2492
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:13,519
and you know so this is this is only you

2493
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,440
know

2494
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,560
five years after that or something right

2495
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:20,000
so not very long and uh it had just

2496
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,760
started to creep around it wouldn't even

2497
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,679
really become famous for another five or

2498
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,039
six years really yeah

2499
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:28,158
at least on the west coast on the west

2500
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,519
coast sir on the west coast sure so

2501
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:31,119
so i'm growing this thing i'm bringing

2502
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,880
everybody by and everyone like they're

2503
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:35,519
like dude it kind of looks

2504
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:39,039
like similar to your sour it must be it

2505
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,120
must be his different sour you know

2506
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:43,359
because it kind of looks like yours yeah

2507
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:45,198
right it's not exactly yours but that's

2508
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,279
got to be it you know

2509
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,839
and so i grow it a couple times and i'm

2510
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:50,639
i'm calling it sour right

2511
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,920
yeah

2512
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:56,159
and then uh at that point in time

2513
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:59,359
um mandelbrot had

2514
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:01,359
he had an open case against him you know

2515
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,279
um so that was part of the reason for

2516
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:05,920
his code name and he never drove himself

2517
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:08,000
anywhere he always had a driver so that

2518
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,079
um if they got pulled over

2519
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,840
he never had to give his license or you

2520
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:12,719
know his id or anything like that you

2521
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,800
know

2522
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,719
yeah i mean yeah it was it was it was

2523
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,400
true like the first i think the first 10

2524
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,239
years i knew him i never saw him like

2525
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:23,198
behind the wheel of a car he always had

2526
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,799
to have a driver did he wear costumes to

2527
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:26,719
the grocery store

2528
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,800
no he didn't he didn't do anything like

2529
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,399
that but it was like he

2530
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,760
he definitely

2531
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:35,119
you know everything had to be in

2532
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:37,039
somebody else's name sure you know um

2533
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,880
because his name would you know he had

2534
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:41,279
some trouble in montana

2535
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,520
yeah and so you know he didn't want to

2536
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,359
deal with that and so he just kind of

2537
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,960
you know back then being a hippie and

2538
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:48,639
going in certain circles you could kind

2539
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,039
of go offline

2540
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:53,199
and live a lifestyle and never have to

2541
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:55,600
pop up on the on the screen you know

2542
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,198
yeah yeah and certainly in the 90s and

2543
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,880
early 2000s before everything got

2544
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:01,039
computerized and everything else it was

2545
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:04,239
way easier to do that

2546
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:06,000
um so eventually like for

2547
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:07,519
six months or something after i got him

2548
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,319
i had this room full of what i thought

2549
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,440
was sour and he was rolling down from

2550
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,119
humble

2551
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:14,799
and i was like dude

2552
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:16,639
you didn't give me two different strains

2553
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,480
you gave me this one strain you never

2554
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,520
gave me what you're supposed to give me

2555
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:21,599
right

2556
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,360
yeah i'm like because i can't tell these

2557
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,600
things apart for anything

2558
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:27,599
like i kept all four original of your of

2559
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,280
your cuts you gave me they're all moms i

2560
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,320
have them all labeled different i grow

2561
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:35,198
them all it's all the same [ __ ] yeah

2562
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:36,799
so he comes down and he walks in my room

2563
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:38,079
and

2564
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,920
he's like this isn't sorry this is the

2565
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,279
headband

2566
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,639
i'm like what he's like yeah this is the

2567
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,439
headband this is what we call the la

2568
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:47,119
cush there's the headband

2569
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:48,559
and i'm like it's not he's like i didn't

2570
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:49,599
give you my sour

2571
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,800
you know

2572
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,639
and

2573
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,320
he ended up liking the sour that i gave

2574
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:55,440
him better than the sour that he had so

2575
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:57,279
he was like i don't even want to give it

2576
01:31:55,439 --> 01:32:00,079
to you because honestly he's like i'm

2577
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:02,639
using yours not mine you know

2578
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:04,079
because yours is nicer so he's like you

2579
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:05,840
definitely got the better of the two

2580
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:09,279
cuts that i gave you

2581
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:11,119
you know um and uh you know and so yeah

2582
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:13,920
and so then i was like

2583
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:14,880
[ __ ] it's the it's it's headband

2584
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,639
right

2585
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,319
yeah he's like i'm like witch headband

2586
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,880
he's like well it gets called the la

2587
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:21,759
kush but it's really a headband

2588
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,800
right

2589
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,960
and

2590
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,279
already you know with the name changes

2591
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,760
yeah but you know actually like you he's

2592
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,920
written he wrote some articles um and

2593
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,520
stuff like that where if you go and you

2594
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,960
look and he talks about like him

2595
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,560
breeding and he talks about breeding

2596
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,719
with the maui super dog and breeding

2597
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:41,280
with other various cuts that i gave him

2598
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:45,198
and every time he writes about the la

2599
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:47,439
cush in parentheses he'll put headband

2600
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:48,799
or original headband yeah you know

2601
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:51,439
because that's what he got it at but

2602
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,119
then in la they called it the la cush

2603
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:56,079
which obviously within a few years

2604
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:57,760
became you know nonsensical because

2605
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,399
the kush that became famous was

2606
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:03,360
significantly different you know

2607
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:05,198
but then it wasn't right

2608
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,119
so

2609
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:08,638
and that's actually and you know he did

2610
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:10,238
some breeding work with that headband

2611
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,560
cut and that's that's what became the

2612
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:13,519
707 headband

2613
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,320
is

2614
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,560
the mother of uh the mother of the seven

2615
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:19,840
oh said headband is that's is that is

2616
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,159
that cut

2617
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,520
and you know he actually passed it out

2618
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:25,920
freely

2619
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,639
uh to various people at times but it was

2620
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,560
releases but it was really finicky

2621
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:33,039
um and it didn't it wasn't as as

2622
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,560
consistent a producer as the sour diesel

2623
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:36,399
that i gave him was

2624
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,080
and so most people dramatically

2625
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:41,359
preferred the sour

2626
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:44,000
yeah even though i liked the high better

2627
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,880
of the actual headband cut

2628
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,719
right

2629
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,480
yeah and so this is

2630
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,399
this is years

2631
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:52,238
years before

2632
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:54,479
i mean i don't think the lumpa headband

2633
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:55,599
cut popped up on the scene until like oh

2634
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:57,919
eight

2635
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,320
or only yeah much later yeah

2636
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,399
i mean uh csi knows it for sure because

2637
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,719
he's got all the uh like you know like

2638
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:07,599
he does and as inspector style he's got

2639
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,679
all the forum posts archived and stuff

2640
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,079
like that of when it actually came about

2641
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:14,960
but yeah even the other even the other

2642
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,840
cut that got renamed headband that's a

2643
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,600
kush

2644
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:21,760
that one didn't even start to spread out

2645
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:24,320
until 0607 correct you know so this one

2646
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,079
preceded these things by you know five

2647
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:27,679
to nine years

2648
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:29,760
in a way

2649
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,520
so i think it might be the original

2650
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,280
headband cut

2651
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,239
uh i don't know

2652
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,639
you know

2653
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:38,638
yeah because we we never even found out

2654
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,319
the human that named it headband or who

2655
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,880
cracked it or

2656
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:45,039
but i will say that um you know we were

2657
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,400
talking much earlier about

2658
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:49,198
you know for instance

2659
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:50,158
csi you you touched on like why

2660
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:51,919
you know

2661
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:53,279
why he's kind of the gold standard and

2662
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,000
one of the things that he does is he

2663
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:57,599
grows out a ton of his own work right

2664
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
yep so when you grow out a ton of your

2665
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,560
own work you obviously get to see what

2666
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,319
traits the various plants you have pass

2667
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,920
on to their progeny

2668
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,519
which if you don't grow your own work

2669
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:10,000
you don't get to see what's a consistent

2670
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,080
breeder you don't get to see what what

2671
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,920
what it throws how it behaves you know

2672
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,519
you're just taking two famous names

2673
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,800
mashing them together and offering them

2674
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,840
to the public right yep and so

2675
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,079
you know

2676
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,840
um one of the things that the superdog

2677
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:27,198
project did to me

2678
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,880
was it gave me a really really good idea

2679
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:32,399
of what

2680
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,679
uh the super skunk and what the chem dog

2681
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:36,879
do

2682
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:38,560
right yeah especially crossed obviously

2683
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,800
but like what they throw and all the

2684
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:43,440
various ranges of what they throw

2685
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,880
and that like you know and so

2686
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:50,079
um you know i'm pretty convinced

2687
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:53,118
that uh that headband cut has

2688
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:54,639
91 and super skunk in there

2689
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:56,399
it's interesting

2690
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:58,800
um you know how

2691
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:00,559
you know is it you know and and we've

2692
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,560
talked about it you know like i mean one

2693
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,400
of the one of the people involved in the

2694
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,960
in the sour diesel story at the very

2695
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:08,399
beginning was vondo right yeah who we've

2696
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,279
gone to interview

2697
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:11,679
and

2698
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:14,000
you know he popped

2699
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,399
you know he he popped some of those

2700
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,520
seeds after he moved to southern

2701
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:18,559
california

2702
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,639
yep

2703
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,039
i'm not saying that like the headband is

2704
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,560
that but i'm just saying that you know

2705
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:25,600
um

2706
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,280
somewhere

2707
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,800
it you know if you grow it and you grow

2708
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:32,479
the sour it is in the diesel family yeah

2709
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,199
i remember smoking it

2710
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:37,519
i would bet almost any amount of money

2711
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:38,559
that how how exactly it's in the diesel

2712
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,880
family

2713
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,920
like what exactly it contains but it's

2714
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,440
like i've grown enough of that stuff out

2715
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,000
right

2716
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:50,399
and sour and 91 and you know super skunk

2717
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,479
and 91 hybrids and stuff that

2718
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:53,439
it's in there somehow

2719
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:54,959
yeah

2720
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:57,118
but i in the

2721
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:59,600
you know 19 years or 18 years or

2722
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:01,920
whatever that i've had it um information

2723
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,880
has been super hard to come by

2724
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,880
you know

2725
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,319
um i like you know like we said even

2726
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,840
with the sour thing and even getting a

2727
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:08,880
bunch of people that were there in the

2728
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,920
moment

2729
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,079
um

2730
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,600
finding out which cut is exactly which

2731
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:16,399
is problematic

2732
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,000
very automatic yeah and so

2733
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:19,198
you know it ended up being it's like one

2734
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,840
of those things where it ended up being

2735
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:23,919
like one of my favorite cuts for effect

2736
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,840
but it was pretty finicky grower and it

2737
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,840
could really freak out on you

2738
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,679
and so it led to a lot of people getting

2739
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,760
rid of it until

2740
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,279
somehow me and maybe one or two other

2741
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,600
people ended up being the only people

2742
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:37,439
with it

2743
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,159
is really kind of what happened and it's

2744
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:43,599
like and you know strangely enough

2745
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:46,559
um before i even knew mean gene

2746
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,960
uh me and jean got this sour cut

2747
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,960
from a mutual friend right

2748
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,480
yeah and it was it was my it was the

2749
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,079
headband cut

2750
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,479
and it makes sense if it was being

2751
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:58,719
passed to sour by mandelbrot well the

2752
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:00,559
other thing is too is that and and this

2753
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:03,279
is this is an admission

2754
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:05,520
um but there was an era

2755
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:07,118
where like a lot of people would come up

2756
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,719
to humboldt mendo and they would act

2757
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:10,319
like a big dog like they were a big

2758
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,920
broker sure

2759
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:13,599
and they were in control and they had

2760
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,399
the money and they were the man

2761
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,840
right

2762
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:19,759
but in reality the actual man that gave

2763
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:21,760
them the money was like go up to mendo

2764
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,800
and buy these buy one of these three

2765
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,600
strains

2766
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,960
yeah

2767
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,039
so there would be times where it was

2768
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,800
like i would have amazing chem d or

2769
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,079
amazing this or amazing that and they'd

2770
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,159
smoke it and they'd be like this is

2771
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:33,359
absolute fire

2772
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:36,479
and then they'd admit to me that they

2773
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,759
didn't have permission to buy that

2774
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:38,479
right like it would happen all the time

2775
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,159
like

2776
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:41,678
i need to buy these things these are the

2777
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:42,960
things i'm looking for i don't have

2778
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,560
permission

2779
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,960
you know like they wouldn't want to

2780
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,239
admit that but when it came down to it

2781
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,520
because finally i'd be like dude if you

2782
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:50,879
think this is some of the nicest weed

2783
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,320
you've seen in like eight months why

2784
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,239
won't you snap it

2785
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:56,799
yeah and they'd be like well the guy

2786
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:59,039
that i'm getting it for he told me i can

2787
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:00,159
only get these two things

2788
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:02,800
right

2789
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:05,039
so my whole crew

2790
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,639
started selling that headband cut as

2791
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:08,639
sour diesel

2792
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:11,118
yeah and it became

2793
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,880
the sour diesel so there was this thing

2794
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:15,920
where it was like all these people

2795
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:18,239
wouldn't have permission to buy headband

2796
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,440
right yeah and nobody knew what the la

2797
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:21,118
cush was

2798
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,279
right yeah but they could buy sour

2799
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:24,238
diesel all day

2800
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,399
and so

2801
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:28,158
we called it sour diesel

2802
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,920
to people because that's what moved and

2803
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:31,839
they would absolutely love it and then

2804
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,679
the person that they gave it to they

2805
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,079
would be like you i want you to get as

2806
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,279
much of that sour diesel as you possibly

2807
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:40,479
can

2808
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:41,359
like that's the one i want find that one

2809
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:43,599
right

2810
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:46,559
and it was it was this whole thing right

2811
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,320
where it was like all of my crew knew it

2812
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,480
was headband

2813
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:52,319
but the brokers only had permission to

2814
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,559
buy two or three things

2815
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,639
right and it passed this sour

2816
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,960
yeah even though it was more like fuel

2817
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:00,639
and diesel than it was the traditional

2818
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:05,039
actual like what i consider to be the

2819
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:08,400
sour nose yeah um you know me and jean

2820
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:11,198
um he gets it uh as sour

2821
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:13,359
and that formed the basis of what he

2822
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,238
still has today called the root beer

2823
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:15,118
right

2824
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:17,519
yeah

2825
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:20,559
and then he lost a cut

2826
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,880
and he kept getting back different sours

2827
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,400
and none of them were the none of them

2828
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,079
were the cut that he used to make the

2829
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:29,359
root beer

2830
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:31,519
right yeah and then years later

2831
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,198
i'm sitting next to him and you know

2832
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,880
we're we're hanging out together and i

2833
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:36,559
pass him a jar and i was like tell me

2834
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,480
what you think of this

2835
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,480
and he opens it up and he's like holy

2836
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:42,718
[ __ ] that's the sour

2837
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:44,638
that's the sour that's the sour i use to

2838
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,439
make the root beer

2839
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,880
you know yeah um and so for us it was

2840
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:51,519
like we never like

2841
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,520
renamed it intentional like you know

2842
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,920
what i mean like at first yeah

2843
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,080
at first it was renamed because like it

2844
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,158
didn't come with a label

2845
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:02,719
and everybody assumed it would look so

2846
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:03,599
close to diesel that it had to be diesel

2847
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,359
yeah

2848
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,960
it wasn't whatever headband it was

2849
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:08,880
supposed to be it had to be diesel so we

2850
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,399
called it diesel for a bit and then

2851
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,159
mandelbach cleared it up that it was

2852
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:15,279
actual headband

2853
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:16,638
and then brokers still wanted it

2854
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:18,399
as sour

2855
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:20,239
you know

2856
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:20,960
so it ended up getting called you know i

2857
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,000
mean

2858
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,319
the labels never changed you know

2859
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,840
yeah like in our own personal gardens or

2860
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:29,039
anything like that those always stayed

2861
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,480
the same but

2862
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:32,719
you know um

2863
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:35,118
you know we always called it but you

2864
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:37,439
know for a bunch of my friends it's like

2865
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:38,639
they got you know that's it it ended up

2866
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:41,839
being like

2867
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,039
the sour diesel cut that they ran

2868
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,880
for years

2869
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:47,600
you know during that whole

2870
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:49,279
hype phase or whatever you know

2871
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,679
um

2872
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:54,079
and uh you know so

2873
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:56,319
and yeah and it's like it ended up

2874
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:58,880
getting dropped by most people

2875
01:41:56,319 --> 01:42:01,679
um and lost and renamed and different

2876
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:04,800
things and so then it ended up where

2877
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:06,399
only a couple people have it um

2878
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,159
and

2879
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:13,519
it's still like in terms of potency um

2880
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:16,238
it's it's way way way up there

2881
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,400
in terms of effect and it's

2882
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,158
still one of my all-time favorites

2883
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:22,479
um but it's probably like

2884
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,000
the biggest issue i faced

2885
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:25,198
it's like when i would try to describe

2886
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,479
it like i said

2887
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:30,238
is that if i called it headband

2888
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:32,718
everybody had familiarity with some

2889
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,238
other headband yeah

2890
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:36,079
and they believed that whatever headband

2891
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,479
they had the familiarity with was the

2892
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:39,519
real headband the real only and the

2893
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:41,359
original

2894
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,800
yeah and then if i called it la kush

2895
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:44,479
then i get a bunch of people laughing at

2896
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,920
me that i was an ignoramus and that i

2897
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:47,839
didn't know what real kush was and

2898
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,000
they'd show me what real kush was you

2899
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,679
know yeah which of course i knew what it

2900
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,399
was but though so then those were like

2901
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:57,359
the only two names you know

2902
01:42:54,399 --> 01:42:59,359
and yeah and all that you know and so it

2903
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:00,719
became really difficult to like talk

2904
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:02,319
about it and then there's this funny

2905
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:05,198
thing with elites

2906
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:06,559
and it happened to us with the dog too

2907
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:08,238
um where

2908
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,800
you know various brokers and different

2909
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:12,879
people it's like how good can it be if i

2910
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,920
don't have access to it

2911
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,319
yeah

2912
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,399
i know what the best stuff out there is

2913
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:21,118
and if i have what's my most i know what

2914
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:23,039
the best desirable stuff is and so if i

2915
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:24,559
don't have access to it my buddies don't

2916
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:26,880
have access to it and it's not one of

2917
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,600
these hype things how good can it really

2918
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,039
be

2919
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,239
yeah

2920
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:31,760
right

2921
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:34,000
and so you battle that kind of stuff

2922
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,760
like people would people would trip now

2923
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,359
but like i mean there was a point in

2924
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,440
time where like

2925
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:42,719
you know uh

2926
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:44,719
people didn't want to buy the chem dog

2927
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,000
it wasn't frosty enough

2928
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:48,000
yeah that's true

2929
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,679
it didn't look good enough i mean if

2930
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,198
they were willing to sit down and smoke

2931
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:54,079
a joint

2932
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:55,678
100 it would go

2933
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:57,439
but if they're just but you know lots

2934
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,239
and lots of people are just basing it

2935
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,198
off

2936
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:00,079
name

2937
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:02,559
look

2938
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,519
knows price

2939
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,360
yeah

2940
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,679
and you know the longer things have gone

2941
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:10,158
on the less and less people smoke and

2942
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:11,679
the more it becomes just about like i'm

2943
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:12,960
just middle-manning this to the next

2944
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,840
person

2945
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,560
you know

2946
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,840
so i just need a price point and a label

2947
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,199
yeah

2948
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,360
which is why

2949
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:22,879
you know and that's what started like

2950
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:24,158
other people like

2951
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,440
you know breeding with all this

2952
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:28,319
different stuff and that's where you

2953
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:30,879
know blackberry kush or this or that or

2954
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:32,799
you know people changing names to like

2955
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,118
add a name that like

2956
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,320
you know would sell

2957
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:38,399
yeah right

2958
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:40,238
i just need a name that'll sell

2959
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:41,920
i got this cut it doesn't sell i need to

2960
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:43,839
add a name to it

2961
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,079
someone needs to take it from me

2962
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:50,719
you know and uh

2963
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:52,079
yeah and so the you know i don't i mean

2964
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,158
you know and then you know if you want

2965
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:55,679
to talk about headband

2966
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:58,000
um

2967
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:59,279
is my cut the day wrecker i don't know i

2968
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,760
don't think so

2969
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:04,639
you know is my cut the original headband

2970
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,960
i'm i definitely know that it existed

2971
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,000
years before some of these other ones

2972
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,118
you know

2973
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,560
um

2974
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:11,759
i mean you know like the the other

2975
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,080
headband

2976
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,520
um and the lumpa those are basically

2977
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:17,279
like in my opinion those are just

2978
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,360
straight kush

2979
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:20,880
yeah those are ogs yeah those are just

2980
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,198
straight ogs like i don't know if

2981
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,239
they're s ones or bag seed or whatever

2982
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:25,678
else but

2983
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:27,839
i mean they

2984
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:30,079
they're very lg kush dominant whatever

2985
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,319
it is very og kush dominant and they

2986
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:34,319
don't breed for anything else where you

2987
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:35,599
know um

2988
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:38,559
you know and so

2989
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,760
you know is headband sour og

2990
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,320
is it

2991
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:45,280
just super skunk 91

2992
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:47,599
you know a a colombian super skunk

2993
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:49,439
leaning fino you know

2994
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,719
there's theories that i have but not a

2995
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:52,000
bunch of proof

2996
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:54,239
yeah you know

2997
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,399
when it really comes down to it um and

2998
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,479
what's interesting is that you know i've

2999
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:00,719
posted pictures where i showed you where

3000
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,079
um we had some i had some friends of

3001
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,920
ours that went to

3002
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,319
the hills of columbia

3003
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,800
and brought back some seed

3004
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:11,519
and we grew it out and the colombian

3005
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:14,239
looks the closest thing

3006
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,320
to the la headband that i've ever seen

3007
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:18,238
yeah i remember seeing this picture yeah

3008
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:20,079
side by sides where it's just obviously

3009
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,879
it's not the exact same

3010
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:23,679
but like the color the structure the

3011
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,400
look

3012
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:26,319
yeah

3013
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:28,559
and obviously like you know there's

3014
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:31,439
colombian and skunk right yeah

3015
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,800
absolutely so what if it's just a 91

3016
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,599
super skunk

3017
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,920
that leaned colombian yeah it's but very

3018
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:41,760
very possible but kept some of that you

3019
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:44,000
know that that you know that 91 power

3020
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,760
yeah and not that that means anything

3021
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,399
because obviously it's just a trait but

3022
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:50,239
it does variegate you know especially if

3023
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:51,279
it gets hungry you know i mean i can

3024
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:52,479
almost

3025
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:54,079
you know and so

3026
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:56,079
i mean there's a lot of stuff like that

3027
01:46:54,079 --> 01:46:58,000
where it's like sometimes you get a lot

3028
01:46:56,079 --> 01:46:59,118
of information and you can really nail

3029
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,760
down

3030
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:02,880
like provenance and lineage and where it

3031
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,520
comes from

3032
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,199
and you know and other other strains

3033
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,440
just because of the nature of the beast

3034
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:11,759
and how it's all black market or came

3035
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:13,519
from prohibition era you get as much

3036
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,159
info as you can and then you hit a point

3037
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:18,880
where it's just like a wall

3038
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:20,960
i did a uh live feed and it's i think

3039
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,400
it's up on youtube if people want to

3040
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:26,239
look but i actually tried to show

3041
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:28,238
what happens when you research the day

3042
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:30,959
wreck or original diesel cut like the

3043
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:32,399
best way i would just a a framework for

3044
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,639
how i would go about starting to

3045
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,638
research a strain that i have no history

3046
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,319
on and funnily enough like we talked

3047
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:41,118
about dude the diesels are just

3048
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:42,238
convoluted the pot things pop up out of

3049
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:44,319
nowhere

3050
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:47,599
you know as all of a sudden this

3051
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:49,118
clone is injected into the scene with no

3052
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,600
with no history

3053
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:53,679
i mean i have i have some i mean you

3054
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:56,000
know we we've discussed it and i have

3055
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:58,239
some i have some tidbits that aren't

3056
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
very well known that i think are part of

3057
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:02,319
the sour story

3058
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
it's not the complete sour story but

3059
01:48:02,319 --> 01:48:06,079
it's certainly parts that don't get

3060
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,880
talked about too much you know

3061
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:08,399
um

3062
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,679
and uh

3063
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:11,439
you know and then it's and then there's

3064
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,960
also this thing too that happens where

3065
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:16,479
it's like you have people that are young

3066
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,158
and they're in their early 20s and

3067
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:20,238
they're making decisions and they end up

3068
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:21,198
doing stuff that becomes famous years

3069
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:22,879
later

3070
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,559
and then

3071
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,079
you know

3072
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,000
there's rep and

3073
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:29,920
and this and that attached to all that

3074
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
kind of stuff and how do you

3075
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:34,000
you know how do you delicately search

3076
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,880
for the truth without stepping on their

3077
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,118
toes about like you know certain aspects

3078
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,400
of their story or history where you're

3079
01:48:39,118 --> 01:48:41,920
not even like

3080
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:43,759
trying to like out out and call them

3081
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,880
like oh you're a liar you're this you're

3082
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,239
that but

3083
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,679
i mean let's be honest like if you're

3084
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:51,359
doing stuff when you're 19 20 21 24 or

3085
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:52,960
whatever and then 10 years later it

3086
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:54,639
becomes famous

3087
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,039
like you don't know what you were doing

3088
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:59,279
at the time was gonna matter

3089
01:48:57,039 --> 01:49:01,118
without a doubt yeah how do you even you

3090
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:03,840
know maybe maybe your memory isn't even

3091
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:05,839
that good you know maybe you know maybe

3092
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,239
you don't i mean what they've discovered

3093
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:11,520
right is that one of the most unreliable

3094
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:13,759
things in court systems is eyewitnesses

3095
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,280
absolutely yeah

3096
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,360
and they've proven it over and over

3097
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:19,359
again where it's like eyewitnesses you

3098
01:49:17,359 --> 01:49:20,559
would think that but people's memories

3099
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:22,238
are different

3100
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,760
you know and they can convince

3101
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:25,759
themselves that they remember things

3102
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,760
that aren't exactly the case

3103
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:29,920
yeah memories and perspectives

3104
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,440
everything yeah or you know you might

3105
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,039
have an incident where like one of your

3106
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:34,638
best friends and you experience

3107
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:36,560
something and they barely remember it

3108
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,599
but it sticks in your mind like really

3109
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,400
strong

3110
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:40,719
yeah

3111
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:42,319
yeah and you know you can't believe that

3112
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,000
they don't remember certain details

3113
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:45,920
because you remember them really clearly

3114
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,279
and they have a vague memory

3115
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,800
you know

3116
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:50,399
and so

3117
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,079
deals with that with me all the time

3118
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:54,079
where she looks at me like i'm an alien

3119
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:55,920
because i don't remember something

3120
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:58,238
yeah and that kind of stuff really does

3121
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:59,920
play into it you know i mean

3122
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:02,559
you know i mean obviously this is like a

3123
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:05,118
wide-ranging topic about things but i

3124
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,960
mean i i think and i think i have some

3125
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:09,679
reasonably good proof that i think the

3126
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:11,920
basis of sour diesel is

3127
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,359
91 by super skunk

3128
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,079
i would agree

3129
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:17,279
you know and um you know it's that you

3130
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:18,800
know there's certain things that i

3131
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:21,039
believe that are just like evidence

3132
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,719
based on like observation of knowing the

3133
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:23,679
strains and seeing them both bred

3134
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:24,960
together

3135
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:26,960
yeah but then you know we have other

3136
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,480
tidbits too where it's like

3137
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,760
i mean i don't know if this is this this

3138
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:31,279
should be the time that we talk about

3139
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,719
this or not but

3140
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:34,479
um

3141
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:35,520
you know uh

3142
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:37,439
after

3143
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,159
after chem dog got

3144
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:42,479
um the super skunk

3145
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:44,079
in 93 um

3146
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:45,039
he started growing it

3147
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:47,279
right

3148
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:48,639
uh and it turned and it hermed all over

3149
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:50,639
his stuff

3150
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:52,079
yeah right and that's the interesting

3151
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:54,079
thing you know i mentioned this on the

3152
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:56,000
live but i'll bring it up again

3153
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:58,399
just for the people that missed it where

3154
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,158
the super skunk was unusual in that you

3155
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:02,319
know if you have an eight week strain or

3156
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:03,839
a nine week strain and you get tiger

3157
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:04,880
striped seeds out of it when it's

3158
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,960
finished

3159
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,639
it got pollinated in like week two or

3160
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,639
three yes

3161
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,719
right because it takes a good anybody

3162
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,400
that breeds knows it takes a good four

3163
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,000
or five weeks

3164
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:18,238
from pollination

3165
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,079
you know or even longer at times yeah

3166
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,000
yeah

3167
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:24,399
yeah for really for i mean i just mean

3168
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,279
after the initial pollination right

3169
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:29,198
that's what i mean yeah so so you know

3170
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:32,880
it it takes a good long time so when

3171
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:35,678
you're finding viable seeds off of a

3172
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:38,159
strain you cut at 62 days or something

3173
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:41,039
it was probably pollinated in week three

3174
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:44,719
yep real early on and so the super skunk

3175
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:46,158
would throw herms early and late right

3176
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:49,039
it was a real pain in the ass in that

3177
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,399
regard and it was super live pollen

3178
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:52,719
and

3179
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:54,638
it really really was i mean it

3180
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:56,719
if you stressed it at all or anything

3181
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:58,719
like that it would just throw live

3182
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:00,399
bananas yeah

3183
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,840
and um

3184
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:03,039
you know and i mentioned this too is i

3185
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,119
think that

3186
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:07,039
with linked traits i think the most

3187
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,319
ranked super skunks

3188
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:10,479
came

3189
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,639
with terms

3190
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:15,439
i think that some of that terp was

3191
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:17,199
linked to that hermaphrodism trait and

3192
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:19,198
that as people tried to breed away from

3193
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:20,879
it they bred away and more towards the

3194
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:23,598
sweet skunk or the

3195
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,840
onion garlic skunk and not like the rank

3196
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:27,760
rank skunk right yeah

3197
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,880
so anyway so

3198
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:32,560
um chem dog calls up my buddy

3199
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,960
in 1994

3200
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,159
and he's super excited because he's

3201
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,239
grown up

3202
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:39,759
some of these seeds that accidentally

3203
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:42,879
got made

3204
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,719
by by him growing the 91 and the super

3205
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,960
skunk in the same room

3206
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,960
and he is in love with them

3207
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:51,840
so he calls up my buddy from staten

3208
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,679
island and uh who's obviously in sonoma

3209
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,719
at this point and he's super excited in

3210
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:59,520
1994 because

3211
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,800
the super skunk accidentally pollinated

3212
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,960
the chem dog

3213
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,960
um and he's growing out some of these

3214
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,239
things and he thinks the hybrids are

3215
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,920
incredible

3216
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,718
they're bigger

3217
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:12,480
they're more vigorous they reek

3218
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:14,960
all this stuff right

3219
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:16,238
yeah and that was actually one of the

3220
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,480
one of the

3221
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:20,879
like you know inspirations

3222
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:24,000
um not you know was

3223
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,920
um for even beginning the super dog

3224
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,118
was we want obviously we we wanted to

3225
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:31,359
combine the traits into a single thing

3226
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:32,880
but you know we already knew people that

3227
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:34,000
had accidentally done it and this is

3228
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,760
obviously

3229
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,760
way long before

3230
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,079
you know reversals or anything like that

3231
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:42,880
you know sure um so that that wasn't

3232
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:45,359
even in the cards you know um

3233
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:46,560
but uh he was he was

3234
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:49,039
ecstatic

3235
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,080
he was preferring

3236
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:53,519
to

3237
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:55,920
grow these to even the chem dog

3238
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,639
right yeah they were they were bigger

3239
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,800
they were stinkier they were more rank

3240
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,319
they were you know they just

3241
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,719
you know and think about it too right

3242
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:07,759
like so 1994 whatever i mean you're

3243
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:08,480
talking chem dog is in his early 20s

3244
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,239
yeah

3245
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:12,079
right super young still

3246
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:13,279
you know um

3247
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:15,198
and uh

3248
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:16,158
you know and so he

3249
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:18,638
um

3250
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:19,519
so he was telling my buddy

3251
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:21,199
that

3252
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,199
he was basically

3253
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:24,158
running rooms of these things

3254
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:26,719
right

3255
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:28,879
um and that was what he was doing

3256
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:29,920
and because they yielded better

3257
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,079
and

3258
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:34,960
you know and all that right and he was

3259
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:37,198
selling it as chem dog

3260
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,359
because that was that was his name that

3261
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:40,799
was his gig and so like

3262
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,439
yeah it was like you weren't buying a

3263
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:44,400
strain you were buying chem dogs weed

3264
01:54:43,439 --> 01:54:45,678
correct

3265
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:47,439
right that's kind of how they looked at

3266
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:48,239
it you know

3267
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:49,039
well

3268
01:54:48,238 --> 01:54:51,678
so

3269
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:52,719
i've grown the 91 for a couple decades

3270
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:54,480
now and

3271
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:56,880
you know uh

3272
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,519
you know skunk va's grown it for a

3273
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:02,159
quarter century now you know and various

3274
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:05,040
things and it really doesn't hurt

3275
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:07,439
yeah it doesn't make seed

3276
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:08,719
right correct correct so the part that

3277
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:11,279
people don't know

3278
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,520
is that so you take this conversation

3279
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:15,118
where he's expressing to my buddy how

3280
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,719
much he loves growing the hybrids and

3281
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,719
he's growing rooms full of these hybrids

3282
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,560
and he's having great success

3283
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,000
and when we interviewed vondo and those

3284
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,400
guys right

3285
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,118
yeah they said in 1994 when they were

3286
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:31,679
getting all that work from chemdawg

3287
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:31,679
they found what 15 or 18 seeds

3288
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,719
you know

3289
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:36,880
something like that something or

3290
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,319
something along those lines as they were

3291
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,840
as they were getting the work from him

3292
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:40,799
right yeah

3293
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,239
so

3294
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,760
a bunch of people

3295
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:44,959
were um

3296
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,880
you know they've always you know

3297
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,239
everybody thought okay you know like the

3298
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,480
story is

3299
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:53,359
that you know it came out of

3300
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:56,559
chem 91 seed yeah you know that was the

3301
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:58,639
basis of it right sure but without that

3302
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,960
conversation to my buddy

3303
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:04,319
you wouldn't know that he was actually

3304
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,840
growing hybrids then uh correct you know

3305
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:08,158
and so

3306
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,920
and then you know like when you when you

3307
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:12,319
take what i consider to be any of the

3308
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:14,480
children of the super skunk

3309
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:17,198
they all have herm tendencies

3310
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:18,559
yes they do it all passes that herm

3311
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:20,638
trait onto it

3312
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,920
you know and

3313
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:24,319
and so

3314
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:27,279
you know in like i don't even think i've

3315
01:56:24,319 --> 01:56:29,039
found 15 or 18 seeds in chem dog in the

3316
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:30,559
20 years i've grown it

3317
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:32,399
i bet yeah

3318
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,639
you know or like it just doesn't you

3319
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:37,198
know so for them to find that many in

3320
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:38,079
the space of like half a year

3321
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:40,319
right

3322
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:43,439
and then you combine that with

3323
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:46,639
then you combine that with um the fact

3324
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:48,479
that chem dog expressed how happy he was

3325
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:50,239
with the hybrids that he'd accidentally

3326
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:51,759
made right

3327
01:56:50,238 --> 01:56:54,000
he thought they were significantly

3328
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:55,280
better than the original correct

3329
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,719
yeah

3330
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:59,359
all right i mean that's what you said

3331
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:01,198
yeah yeah and i mean i can i can totally

3332
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:02,799
see that in the sense that

3333
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:05,118
you know like

3334
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,679
the best super dogs that we did years

3335
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:10,158
later had the growth and the vigor and

3336
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:12,000
the stretch and the rank of the skunk

3337
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:16,719
but it had the potency

3338
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,238
and the depth of power of the of the 91.

3339
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:20,719
yeah right

3340
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:22,638
so i mean we we had a slightly different

3341
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:25,359
path to that and that ours wasn't an

3342
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,159
accidental herm pollination right

3343
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:28,559
um

3344
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:29,598
but i could totally see that happening

3345
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:32,000
right

3346
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:34,079
and he's selling all that as chem dog

3347
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,960
because he's chem dog because that's his

3348
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:39,760
brand that's his brand right and

3349
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:42,639
and so you know and so then these so

3350
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,960
then vondo and these guys they collect

3351
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:47,039
whatever it was you know x amount some

3352
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:49,760
amount of seeds in the teens

3353
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:52,319
and they grow those up you know and

3354
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:55,679
and and you know they get diesel they

3355
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:58,880
get diesel one and two right yep

3356
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:59,760
out of that diesel one herms

3357
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,359
right

3358
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,360
and we're not sure what else was in the

3359
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:06,158
room or exactly what happened but out of

3360
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:07,359
that herm came the first sour plants

3361
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:09,198
correct and

3362
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:12,559
i believe he said that there were seeds

3363
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:13,519
in a baggie labeled our diesel

3364
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,320
yeah

3365
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:20,159
right and so yeah if you look

3366
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:22,079
at those polaroids that in this last six

3367
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:25,598
or eight months that skunk va has been

3368
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:28,399
posting right yep you can see the sour

3369
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:30,880
in the structure of that super skunk

3370
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:32,879
oh without a doubt

3371
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:36,239
i mean you can it's just like as clear

3372
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,039
as a bell you can see it you know

3373
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:37,759
um

3374
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:40,800
so

3375
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:43,280
do i know the whole sour diesel story

3376
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:44,639
you know um by you know every step of

3377
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:47,198
the way no

3378
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:49,760
but i think that those two bits of

3379
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:52,559
evidence that aren't super well known

3380
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:56,560
like i think the fact that it started

3381
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,920
out as beans out of a 91 super skunk

3382
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:59,199
hybrid

3383
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:01,039
are

3384
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:03,759
pretty solid

3385
01:59:01,039 --> 01:59:05,679
without a doubt now there's two things

3386
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,039
right so the beans that they were

3387
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:08,560
finding

3388
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:10,158
they could have been

3389
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:14,880
they could have been

3390
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:16,238
um s-ones of this 91 super skunk right

3391
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,199
or they could have even been the super

3392
01:59:16,238 --> 01:59:21,678
skunk

3393
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:21,678
pollinating that hybrid itself again

3394
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,039
it sure could have

3395
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,359
because he had you know he was still

3396
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:29,599
growing the super skunk every rip you

3397
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:31,598
know yeah so you know you don't know

3398
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,679
it's hard to say but

3399
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:35,840
you know the original sour cuts i can

3400
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,599
see the dog and i can see the super

3401
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,639
skunk in both

3402
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:40,639
like

3403
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:42,719
i mean you know i grew the super skunk

3404
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:45,599
for 10 years before i lost it we still

3405
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:48,239
have the chem dog icons in the you know

3406
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:50,960
in the in the original sour cuts

3407
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:51,759
i can see it oh without a doubt i would

3408
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:54,000
agree

3409
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:55,599
it's in there you know and then that's

3410
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,158
another thing right where it's like that

3411
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:59,360
super skunk's you know ability to herm

3412
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:01,679
on itself

3413
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:03,679
essentially created like

3414
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:04,719
an enormous line

3415
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:07,760
yeah

3416
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:10,000
a major part of the industry

3417
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:12,800
create the sour diesel for a good 10

3418
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,679
years was like the most famous the most

3419
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:18,320
desirable cut in america yep

3420
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:19,760
the east coast had an endless endless

3421
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:21,920
desire for it

3422
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:24,159
it sure did you know it had the nose it

3423
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,920
had the potency it had the name it had

3424
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:27,039
power it had all those types of things

3425
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,639
you know

3426
02:00:27,039 --> 02:00:32,079
and uh so you know i mean there's all

3427
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:34,159
this these rumors about dnl and rks and

3428
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:36,559
this and this and everything else and we

3429
02:00:34,158 --> 02:00:38,238
got to hear vondo's version and all that

3430
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,320
and just like anything else there was a

3431
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:43,198
few other plants in the room at the time

3432
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:45,679
too you know yeah um

3433
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:48,000
you know so it's not like

3434
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:50,079
it's not 100 figured out and it's

3435
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,238
unlikely just the way that it worked out

3436
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:54,238
with a bunch of young kids growing some

3437
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:55,759
rooms and partying at the same time than

3438
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:56,799
it ever would be

3439
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,719
um

3440
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:01,920
but i think that you know that part of

3441
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:04,000
it isn't is is really not known at all

3442
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,920
you know yeah it isn't and so a lot of

3443
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,238
people just assume

3444
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,719
that oh it had it you know the basis of

3445
02:01:08,238 --> 02:01:12,399
it is this you know yeah and people

3446
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,158
don't realize that like you know chem

3447
02:01:12,399 --> 02:01:15,598
dog called things chem dog because that

3448
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,000
was his brand

3449
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:19,679
yeah you know i mean he called the d

3450
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,920
later on chem dog

3451
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:24,079
yeah i remember that yeah because you're

3452
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:25,599
buying weed from cam dog

3453
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:27,599
and and and

3454
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:28,960
for the time that actually that made

3455
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,000
sense a lot of people would have done

3456
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,359
that

3457
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,520
yeah i don't i don't think it was

3458
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:36,238
anything shady no you know it's like

3459
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:38,560
people didn't have this like intensive

3460
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:40,638
like lineage and this and that and

3461
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,800
everything else he was chem dog

3462
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:44,239
he grew chem dog you bought chem dog

3463
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,039
from chem dog

3464
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:47,039
you know

3465
02:01:45,039 --> 02:01:48,960
i mean you know whether that was the 91

3466
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:50,399
or that whether that was a 91 super

3467
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,439
skunk hybrid or whether that was the

3468
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:53,039
chem d

3469
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:54,799
you know or whatever else you're buying

3470
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:56,479
chem dog correct

3471
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,400
and all those things he was growing were

3472
02:01:56,479 --> 02:02:00,479
probably fire because the parent

3473
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:02,479
genetics were incredible so it's not

3474
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:03,759
like anybody was unhappy

3475
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:05,598
yeah i'm sure

3476
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:07,679
i mean those guys vondo on those guys

3477
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,520
they saved all those beans and cracked

3478
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:11,039
those beans because those things were

3479
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,040
fire

3480
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:14,479
and they knew they were special and they

3481
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:16,319
like they were special because they were

3482
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:18,638
getting fire so like when they realized

3483
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,639
there was seeds in there they kept

3484
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:22,159
hunting for more seed

3485
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:24,960
to save

3486
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:27,039
right just like traditional 90s you know

3487
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,960
you find beans and a good bag of weed

3488
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:30,960
and you put it in your little box

3489
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,118
yep in your sock drawer or whatever you

3490
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,719
know and

3491
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:35,679
you know and so

3492
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,840
um

3493
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:39,118
they but then you know the most likely

3494
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,360
thing to me

3495
02:02:39,118 --> 02:02:43,198
is that the diesel one or whatever

3496
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:45,598
hermed on itself

3497
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:48,319
yeah i would agree

3498
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:49,760
you know and then it's a it's a mix of

3499
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:52,238
you know and then you're gonna get all

3500
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:54,480
whatever is whatever the 91 actually is

3501
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:57,279
combined with super skunk which is a

3502
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:58,879
skunk one by maple leaf indica

3503
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:00,960
you're gonna get a whole range at that

3504
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:02,800
point yeah

3505
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,480
of things

3506
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:07,199
you know going through those jesuless

3507
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:09,919
ones i was able to see so much of super

3508
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:11,198
skunk all of its different expressions

3509
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,520
and i think it may have been one of the

3510
02:03:11,198 --> 02:03:15,759
most valuable tools uh and learning

3511
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:20,639
experiences in my breeding career was to

3512
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:23,119
go specifically through those gsls ones

3513
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:24,560
yeah you know and and it's like it

3514
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:26,960
you know people have tried to piece

3515
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,880
together the story and it becomes

3516
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:30,639
all it takes is a little bit of

3517
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,039
misinformation or a little bit of

3518
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:35,118
misunderstood information and then you

3519
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,279
try to like extrapolate a bunch of facts

3520
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:39,598
based on that you know

3521
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:41,198
yeah um you know but

3522
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:42,960
you look at you know you look at some of

3523
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:47,678
the stories where it's like oh well this

3524
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:49,359
stuff was chem 91 by northern lights one

3525
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:51,199
yeah right but then it doesn't look

3526
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:51,920
anything like that

3527
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:54,158
no

3528
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:56,800
but then you look at the sour diesel and

3529
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:58,559
you look at those old pics that skunk va

3530
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,480
is posted of the super skunk and you're

3531
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,639
like oh man that looks like

3532
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:04,238
they look very close

3533
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,400
yeah and

3534
02:04:04,238 --> 02:04:08,839
and that segues into

3535
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:11,598
the the massachusetts super

3536
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:13,920
skunk specifically what we've what we've

3537
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:16,000
been learning lately in regards to

3538
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:18,399
possibly there'd be there being two

3539
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,399
different cuts

3540
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:22,078
well i mean so

3541
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:23,519
you know one of the things that happened

3542
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:25,439
is that

3543
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:28,400
i mean this is just this is just

3544
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:30,078
conjecture on in on my on my view

3545
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:32,078
obviously because i'm from the east

3546
02:04:30,078 --> 02:04:35,599
coast and i wasn't tied into those crews

3547
02:04:32,078 --> 02:04:38,158
super deeply i mean i will say that like

3548
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:39,440
most of the stuff that i believe i i had

3549
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:41,679
talked to

3550
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:43,598
my buddy from staten island extensively

3551
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:46,078
about the entire history of all of it i

3552
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:47,520
mean we used to used to sit around and

3553
02:04:46,078 --> 02:04:48,799
um

3554
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,599
you know uh

3555
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:53,520
the that original ss cut i mean if you

3556
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:55,760
opened up the 90

3557
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:58,000
uh seed bank catalog from neville you

3558
02:04:55,760 --> 02:05:00,159
could take side branches of that ss and

3559
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,560
you could hold it right up to that and

3560
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:05,359
it would be like an exact match

3561
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:07,440
yeah i mean it was just exact right like

3562
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:09,359
and he would show trimmers all the time

3563
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:10,960
like look that's super skunk

3564
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:12,960
that's super skunk

3565
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:15,679
you know and you know we've recently

3566
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:18,639
learned you know from uh you know skunk

3567
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:20,719
va's mentor or whatever that um it was

3568
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:22,239
basically you know the the most likely

3569
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,639
thing is that it was a

3570
02:05:22,238 --> 02:05:26,238
a super skunk f2

3571
02:05:24,639 --> 02:05:29,039
yep right

3572
02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:30,879
is is is the is the most likely you know

3573
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:34,000
story that we know that seems to be the

3574
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,719
most based in in in fact or whatever and

3575
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,800
yeah

3576
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,480
and he labeled it six and that led to a

3577
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,159
bunch of confusion because some people

3578
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:42,479
called it six and some people called it

3579
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:45,279
super skunk and those two groups didn't

3580
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:46,959
really overlap you know yeah and all

3581
02:05:45,279 --> 02:05:50,000
that kind of thing and so there's still

3582
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:51,760
some some not entirely perfectly known

3583
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,279
but that seems like it's most likely so

3584
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,880
you're starting with

3585
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:56,639
you know something that you know

3586
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,078
obviously he kept it because it was the

3587
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,078
skunkiest of

3588
02:05:58,078 --> 02:06:01,759
of skunks you know

3589
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:04,799
and can you talk can you talk about some

3590
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:07,199
of its growth traits how did it grow

3591
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,599
uh i mean you can see you know it grew a

3592
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:11,279
bit like sour diesel but not as dense um

3593
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:15,440
it had that feathery

3594
02:06:11,279 --> 02:06:17,118
look um long and lanky long lanky spears

3595
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:19,759
you know gotcha um

3596
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:21,920
it looked dense but it was really light

3597
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:23,599
if that makes sense you know like

3598
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:25,599
especially if you got it too dry you

3599
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:26,480
could just crisp it with your fingers

3600
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:29,039
you know

3601
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:31,198
um it would it would look full

3602
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:33,359
but there was a lot of like air to bud

3603
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:34,559
ratio in there you know silver pearls

3604
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:37,679
that way i think

3605
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:39,280
yeah and so you know it um you know it

3606
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:41,840
uh for most people it looked kind of

3607
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:43,679
like a less dense sour diesel yeah you

3608
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:45,360
know you could have a huge butt of it

3609
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:47,039
and it wouldn't you'd put it on the on

3610
02:06:45,359 --> 02:06:48,880
the scale and it wouldn't weigh that

3611
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:50,479
impressive yeah

3612
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:52,319
because it was it was the opposite of

3613
02:06:50,479 --> 02:06:53,678
like rock hard

3614
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:54,960
exactly even though even though it might

3615
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:56,480
look firm

3616
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,279
it wasn't dense

3617
02:06:56,479 --> 02:06:59,839
yeah

3618
02:06:57,279 --> 02:07:01,759
you know it was lime green i mean really

3619
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,480
if people want to like i said

3620
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:06,800
um you can look at that 90s super skunk

3621
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:07,759
in the seed bank catalog that famous

3622
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,400
picture

3623
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:13,199
and he would hold up side nuggets prop

3624
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:15,359
after crop after crop to that picture

3625
02:07:13,198 --> 02:07:17,839
and it would be like a dead ringer if

3626
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:20,000
you would yeah and it just looked

3627
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,800
exact and he would laugh about it you

3628
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,639
know

3629
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,480
because they're super skunk there is

3630
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:26,000
there's your proof boom you know looks

3631
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:27,759
exactly like it does in the catalog

3632
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,719
reeks like a dead zone yeah

3633
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:30,400
you know

3634
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:32,158
and like i said it wasn't you know it

3635
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:34,238
wasn't the

3636
02:07:32,158 --> 02:07:36,399
you know like by today's standards its

3637
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:38,319
potency wasn't on par with the best

3638
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:41,198
stuff we have today

3639
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:43,359
yeah it just it was moderate potency and

3640
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:45,598
i think we've we've both found that like

3641
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:48,479
when you find the terpius things

3642
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:50,400
they tend to be not the most potent yeah

3643
02:07:48,479 --> 02:07:53,039
um you know maybe that's because some of

3644
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:55,920
those terpenes haven't converted into

3645
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:57,599
you know thc or whatever else or

3646
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,719
entourage effect or whatever you want to

3647
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,199
call it but

3648
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:02,880
um sometimes really flavor flavorful

3649
02:08:01,198 --> 02:08:04,559
things are either light or moderate and

3650
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,400
potency

3651
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:09,520
yeah which is what led us to like the

3652
02:08:06,399 --> 02:08:12,238
superdog project was trying to combine

3653
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:15,679
the potency of the dog with the flavor

3654
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:17,519
of the super skunk you know yeah um and

3655
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:18,560
so getting back to what you were talking

3656
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,159
about

3657
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:22,560
people call it the massachusetts super

3658
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:24,078
skunk even though it's from virginia

3659
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:25,920
and the only reason why it's called

3660
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:28,319
massachusetts super skunk is because my

3661
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:30,000
buddy dropped it off with chemdog on his

3662
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:31,599
way back out to the west coast after

3663
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,920
getting the dog

3664
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:36,078
and it's hard to say

3665
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:38,480
you know i mean unfortunately uh you

3666
02:08:36,078 --> 02:08:40,559
know this is pretty famous by now chem

3667
02:08:38,479 --> 02:08:41,839
dog got wrapped up in that whole res the

3668
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:46,880
rat issue

3669
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:49,119
yep and he got busted in 1996 i believe

3670
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:50,400
2006 or 96.

3671
02:08:49,118 --> 02:08:52,078
i thought it was

3672
02:08:50,399 --> 02:08:54,000
i'm not sure

3673
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:56,000
i thought it was earlier

3674
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,880
uh it might it might have been earlier i

3675
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:03,639
just remember the the the high times the

3676
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:03,639
first one he did i want to say was 2006

3677
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:09,439
my point my point to all that is that i

3678
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:11,279
think he he definitely got i think if

3679
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:12,799
you look back on the old forums he

3680
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:15,840
definitely got himself into a bit of

3681
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:18,320
trouble in 96. yeah and i think most of

3682
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,760
the super skunks that got passed out

3683
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:20,960
after that

3684
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:23,039
um

3685
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:25,599
like doesn't look like those pictures

3686
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:27,439
that's that skunk va posts

3687
02:09:25,599 --> 02:09:29,840
no not at all

3688
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:32,399
not at all it looks much shorter it

3689
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:36,159
looks much more afghani it looks much

3690
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:38,719
denser right yeah it's short squat

3691
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:39,839
shortened squat instead of being

3692
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:41,920
long and

3693
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:44,000
and running you know

3694
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:46,399
light spears you know

3695
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,039
um and so you know

3696
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:52,799
it's amazing that he has those pictures

3697
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:56,158
from 1995 because those are absolute

3698
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:58,639
evidence that's guaranteed the cut yeah

3699
02:09:56,158 --> 02:10:00,799
being able to find those solved or being

3700
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:02,560
able to see those pictures

3701
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:03,599
it answered a lot of questions that we

3702
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:05,360
had had

3703
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,360
yeah you know and so it's well then it's

3704
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:08,960
like i mean he grew it for quite some

3705
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:10,319
time and i grew it for quite some time

3706
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:12,239
and so did other friends of ours and

3707
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:15,279
stuff but it's like there's no way you

3708
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:18,238
can convince people based on your memory

3709
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:20,399
you know so having actual evidence

3710
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:22,158
like that from that era

3711
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:24,799
you know i think it's quite possible

3712
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:26,799
that you know there was a mix-up on the

3713
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:31,119
east coast and what got really passed

3714
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:34,320
around at length about as mss wasn't

3715
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:37,039
correct and and what was used in geezel

3716
02:10:34,319 --> 02:10:39,039
was whatever the second cut that was

3717
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:40,880
going around as mss was

3718
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:43,599
you know now it's also entirely possible

3719
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:45,118
that it you know it could be

3720
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:48,239
you know that could be

3721
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:49,920
an s1 found in the actual buds of super

3722
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:52,078
skunk

3723
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,639
you know it definitely could um because

3724
02:10:52,078 --> 02:10:55,679
it hurt you know and so you know maybe

3725
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:57,599
he had

3726
02:10:55,679 --> 02:11:00,480
you know some seed in it like i said in

3727
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:02,560
your 90s box of good seed maybe he had

3728
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:04,879
some seed that he found in the chem dog

3729
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:06,400
from super skunk seeds and that's where

3730
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,480
some of those hybrids and other things

3731
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:10,319
came from and then maybe he had some

3732
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:12,799
beads he found in super skunk and that's

3733
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:14,960
where that came from you know and that's

3734
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:17,119
why your diesel experiments

3735
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:19,198
look so close to so many different kinds

3736
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:21,039
of super skunk expression

3737
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:22,960
yeah there's definitely super skunk in

3738
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:24,800
it but because it wasn't

3739
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:27,520
it wasn't the same one and then you know

3740
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,039
various various mss have popped up in

3741
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:30,639
recent years as

3742
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:32,158
the skunk terp

3743
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:33,599
um have been

3744
02:11:32,158 --> 02:11:35,839
you know has been sort of like the

3745
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:37,440
unicorn or the holy grail and everyone

3746
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:38,560
wants to have it and claim that they've

3747
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:40,799
got it

3748
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:43,199
um you know but

3749
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,320
until somebody like me or

3750
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:46,638
you know

3751
02:11:44,319 --> 02:11:48,639
skunk va or others like

3752
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:50,078
everybody claims seeds of it but nobody

3753
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:51,440
brings jars

3754
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:53,439
to events

3755
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:55,118
where or passes it out where you can be

3756
02:11:53,439 --> 02:11:56,078
like oh this is it

3757
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:57,679
exactly

3758
02:11:56,078 --> 02:12:00,639
um people want to breed with it people

3759
02:11:57,679 --> 02:12:01,599
want to get it be like oh this is legit

3760
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:03,440
but then

3761
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:05,679
it doesn't look like the one of old it

3762
02:12:03,439 --> 02:12:08,319
doesn't smell like the one of old you

3763
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:10,880
know we we both know that skunk va has

3764
02:12:08,319 --> 02:12:12,719
gotten a number of of cuts or samples of

3765
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,319
things that people are pretty sure is it

3766
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:16,639
from the east coast

3767
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:18,479
and he doesn't think they're even close

3768
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:22,078
yeah you know

3769
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:24,158
so you know as far as we know it's dead

3770
02:12:22,078 --> 02:12:27,359
yeah

3771
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:29,439
currently that is the status of mss or

3772
02:12:27,359 --> 02:12:31,679
if it's not dead it's

3773
02:12:29,439 --> 02:12:33,359
with people that you know someone could

3774
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,960
still have it somewhere but it's not

3775
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:37,039
tied into

3776
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:39,118
um you know the community where it

3777
02:12:37,039 --> 02:12:41,359
hasn't actually popped up

3778
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:43,118
exactly you know and you know that can

3779
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:45,118
happen sometimes things can be lost and

3780
02:12:43,118 --> 02:12:47,279
one or two people ends up having it and

3781
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:49,279
they don't even realize that it's

3782
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:52,238
because they're not tied into the forums

3783
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,359
or the instagram or the larger community

3784
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:55,759
and they don't even realize they're

3785
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:56,719
sitting on something rare and amazing

3786
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:58,560
yeah

3787
02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:00,239
so it could be that

3788
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:02,320
you know it's a little more suspicious

3789
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:04,559
now because so many people want to find

3790
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:07,198
it and then want to sell beans of it and

3791
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:10,480
have it and have that terp again you

3792
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:12,319
know yeah but so far it's been a lot of

3793
02:13:10,479 --> 02:13:14,000
a lot of dead ends

3794
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:16,799
yeah it's been a lot of

3795
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,880
mss names but the chirps just don't

3796
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:21,119
match up

3797
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:23,679
no they don't match up and the look

3798
02:13:21,118 --> 02:13:26,719
doesn't match up and it's not

3799
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:29,118
it's just uh you know they just

3800
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:32,719
it just doesn't match up so you know i

3801
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:36,078
mean who knows i mean i know for a fact

3802
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:36,880
that some of her children exist

3803
02:13:36,078 --> 02:13:37,679
yes

3804
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:39,679
and

3805
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:42,560
her children have been bred into all

3806
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:45,520
kinds of things you know yeah and all

3807
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:46,880
that and so you know it it it's like we

3808
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:47,920
were talking about with breeding way

3809
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:50,480
earlier

3810
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:52,960
the progeny exists and are being used in

3811
02:13:50,479 --> 02:13:55,118
all kinds of ways um but whether or not

3812
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:56,078
the mother cut exists is a whole other

3813
02:13:55,118 --> 02:13:59,198
factor

3814
02:13:56,078 --> 02:14:01,439
yeah absolutely and you know until until

3815
02:13:59,198 --> 02:14:02,879
skunk va put up those posts with the

3816
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:05,118
with the polaroids

3817
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:07,279
the only thing i had to go off of as far

3818
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:10,000
as math super skunk and i think most

3819
02:14:07,279 --> 02:14:11,840
people um was that very first chem dog

3820
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:14,639
article in high times where he shows one

3821
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:16,078
picture of something labeled mass skunk

3822
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:18,078
and

3823
02:14:16,078 --> 02:14:21,198
whatever is coming out of jesus is the

3824
02:14:18,078 --> 02:14:22,960
spitting image of that plant and

3825
02:14:21,198 --> 02:14:24,559
and unfortunately

3826
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,359
of course

3827
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:30,000
because i'm so so integral integrally

3828
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:32,639
tied into the diesel cut um

3829
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,399
i wanted it to be the original but

3830
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:36,319
unfortunately that's not how [ __ ] works

3831
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:37,759
sometimes and you just gotta go with the

3832
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:38,799
facts

3833
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,320
yeah i mean

3834
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:42,560
obviously it doesn't mean that it's not

3835
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:43,920
an excellent cut in its own right for

3836
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,840
sure

3837
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:47,118
and all that and it's like you know i

3838
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,599
mean

3839
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:51,598
you know on on the varying expression i

3840
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:53,360
mean obviously like if

3841
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:55,520
if the original super skunk cut that

3842
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:57,279
we've been describing is an f2 of super

3843
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:59,520
skunk in itself

3844
02:14:57,279 --> 02:15:01,920
um then who knows what was exactly in

3845
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:04,320
those genes i mean we know that

3846
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,000
super skunk originally was a

3847
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:08,479
was a an

3848
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,039
80s skunk cross to a maple leaf indica

3849
02:15:08,479 --> 02:15:12,078
that was known as afghan tea you know

3850
02:15:11,039 --> 02:15:13,599
and so

3851
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:15,599
you could get some

3852
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:17,679
more indica variations you could get

3853
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:20,000
some more skunk variations you could get

3854
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:22,000
some colombian or some mexican or some

3855
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,520
you know

3856
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,279
and all that and it seems like the

3857
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:28,560
diesel leans a little bit more towards

3858
02:15:25,279 --> 02:15:30,399
the afghan side of things oh for sure

3859
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:33,280
um and then it seems like those pictures

3860
02:15:30,399 --> 02:15:35,279
that chemdog had in the high times

3861
02:15:33,279 --> 02:15:36,960
leaned more towards the afghan side it

3862
02:15:35,279 --> 02:15:38,078
sure did

3863
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,078
you know

3864
02:15:38,078 --> 02:15:42,078
and you know i mean

3865
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:43,519
chem dog and stuff like that you know

3866
02:15:42,078 --> 02:15:45,198
like

3867
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:46,800
you know i don't want anybody listening

3868
02:15:45,198 --> 02:15:48,559
to any of this to like

3869
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:50,480
you know jump down his throat and

3870
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:52,079
anything like that because

3871
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:54,718
in all honesty like

3872
02:15:52,078 --> 02:15:56,000
between the 91 and the chem d and all

3873
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:58,480
that like

3874
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:00,479
several of my all-time favorite cuts

3875
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:03,678
came out of his little rooms

3876
02:16:00,479 --> 02:16:06,399
yeah absolutely and he was 17 or 18

3877
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:08,319
years old when he popped the 91 and he

3878
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:10,559
was in his early 20s making a bunch of

3879
02:16:08,319 --> 02:16:12,078
these other decisions when these other

3880
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,840
things were happening

3881
02:16:12,078 --> 02:16:15,840
and he just had his little thing going

3882
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:17,599
on and had no idea that everyone was

3883
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:18,400
going to be pouring over

3884
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:20,560
like

3885
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:22,799
every action and every utterance and

3886
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:25,760
every everything later on to try to find

3887
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,960
out like the exact history you know

3888
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,239
and you know what it's like you know

3889
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,480
what it's like to be a

3890
02:16:28,238 --> 02:16:33,039
a young partier in your 20s you know

3891
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:34,638
[ __ ] yeah i do and just then just doing

3892
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:36,080
things and you don't you don't you don't

3893
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:37,199
realize that they're gonna for most

3894
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:38,638
people

3895
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,479
what they're doing right then isn't

3896
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:42,398
gonna have any future importance that

3897
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:45,279
anyone's gonna care about

3898
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:47,199
yeah exactly and for him it's like that

3899
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:48,559
era of his life has gotten put under a

3900
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,359
microscope

3901
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:56,398
you know and various things that he said

3902
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:58,318
in 2006 or 2010 or 2015 all get you know

3903
02:16:56,398 --> 02:17:00,718
whatever the case may be

3904
02:16:58,318 --> 02:17:02,558
it's like people expect him to have some

3905
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:04,239
kind of encyclopedic knowledge of

3906
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:06,799
everything that happened

3907
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:09,039
you know yeah i realized

3908
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:11,358
i can't even remember my early 20s

3909
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:13,359
yeah you know and i mean in all honesty

3910
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:16,639
too it's like when you think about like

3911
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:18,000
you know uh joe b and peabudz sold wheat

3912
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:19,199
on dead tour

3913
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,120
right yes

3914
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:22,960
they sold him some weed

3915
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:25,599
yep they weren't growing weed they were

3916
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:29,039
buying and selling weed as middlemen yes

3917
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:30,639
you know 15 years later they realized

3918
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,639
that something came out of this bag of

3919
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:33,438
weed that they sold

3920
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:36,239
yep

3921
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:38,800
like for real you know and so you know

3922
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:40,000
they played a critical role in making it

3923
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:40,840
all happen

3924
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,920
right

3925
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:45,439
yeah without a doubt and like they might

3926
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,398
even be some of the few people that

3927
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:49,679
actually smoked the herb that the 91

3928
02:17:48,398 --> 02:17:52,000
came out of

3929
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:54,318
the dog right yeah the dog bud or you

3930
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,040
know or whatever it ended up being you

3931
02:17:54,318 --> 02:17:58,799
know but like they got that from someone

3932
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,559
else and you know it's like you let's

3933
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:02,159
say you bought a couple pounds and sold

3934
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:03,518
them in a weekend and then moved on to

3935
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:04,959
some other pounds and you did that

3936
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:06,880
constantly

3937
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:08,000
like how much info would they even

3938
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:09,598
really have

3939
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,359
yeah

3940
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:13,519
you know and it's not like they knew the

3941
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:14,960
17 year old kid that they sold weed to

3942
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:16,079
that took it home and grew some they

3943
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:17,919
weren't like

3944
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:20,000
tight personal friends where they were

3945
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:20,960
part of the story after that until way

3946
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,879
later

3947
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,959
yeah that was much much later when they

3948
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:26,959
came back and realized all that

3949
02:18:24,959 --> 02:18:28,000
it was basically like oh six

3950
02:18:26,959 --> 02:18:29,839
yeah

3951
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
before they realized

3952
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:34,159
so now you're asking to them to remember

3953
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,638
like some weed that they had for a few

3954
02:18:34,159 --> 02:18:38,000
days 15 years before

3955
02:18:36,638 --> 02:18:40,478
everybody and everybody wants to know

3956
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,718
like immense details about it when like

3957
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:45,519
it seems like according to pipa like him

3958
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:48,478
and joe b were on dead tour doing that

3959
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:49,519
from the mid to late 80s on constantly

3960
02:18:48,478 --> 02:18:51,519
yeah

3961
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:53,599
and you're asking them to remember like

3962
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:55,359
one weekend one stop

3963
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:56,880
yeah that would be [ __ ] impossible

3964
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:58,479
for me when that's all they were doing

3965
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:00,398
and they didn't realize that any of that

3966
02:18:58,478 --> 02:19:01,840
was gonna have any special importance

3967
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:02,799
until forever

3968
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,840
yeah

3969
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:05,920
you know

3970
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,760
um but then you know later on like

3971
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,679
everybody expects me you know these kind

3972
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:11,280
of people to be experts

3973
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:12,398
on everything chem

3974
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,599
because they were there in the very

3975
02:19:12,398 --> 02:19:15,599
beginning

3976
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:18,239
yeah and and like you said some of them

3977
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:20,880
didn't have any um interaction with chem

3978
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:24,478
dog that didn't smoke it again for many

3979
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:26,398
many many years after that bag was sold

3980
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:27,920
yeah really until the reunion era when

3981
02:19:26,398 --> 02:19:28,799
they found each other on the forums

3982
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:32,719
again

3983
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:34,239
exactly which was i think 0-6-ish yep

3984
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:36,000
something along those lines i think

3985
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:37,920
that's you know that might be the year

3986
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,200
that that joe b and peabod actually

3987
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:42,398
first saw

3988
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:44,639
91 in person yeah i think it wasn't

3989
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:46,239
and got to smoke some of it you know

3990
02:19:44,638 --> 02:19:48,159
yeah um

3991
02:19:46,239 --> 02:19:50,159
you know i think they they saw it and i

3992
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:53,119
mean they when they all got when they

3993
02:19:50,159 --> 02:19:55,359
all when they all found each other again

3994
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:57,760
you know chem dog gave i think chem dog

3995
02:19:55,359 --> 02:20:00,960
gave joe b four seeds that he said were

3996
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:02,880
part of the original thing he found yeah

3997
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:05,119
and that's where the one and four came

3998
02:20:02,879 --> 02:20:07,438
the one through the four came from

3999
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:09,040
