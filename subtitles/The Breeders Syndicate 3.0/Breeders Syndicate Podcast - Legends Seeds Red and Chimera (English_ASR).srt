1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,119
then uh

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,759
a new lesson in

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,759
goddamn

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,839
see it only lets me search or send

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,599
invites so i've got to wait till

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,920
let me see i can at least get chimera in

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
here

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,038
so

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,279
i'll have [ __ ]

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,118
i'll have kip hit um

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,359
do a request once he gets in here and

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,480
that's how it'll work

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,000
yeah i'm gonna have to have him send a

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,839
request to join i got chimeras but i

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
have to wait till kips does so i can hit

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,320
them both in at the same time because

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,878
when i go to that screen it immediately

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
after it's done it will make it so i

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,878
can't touch anything on the screen to

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
add anyone in or even have comment or

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,839
anything it just freezes the phone so

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
hopefully one more time is all we need i

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
don't know if that's all we need

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,000
whenever kid gets in here let me know

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
sorry to keep doing you dirty guys

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,198

cobbler

55
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,958
ever made in history for a fat kid to

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,759
love

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,360

58
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,000
you got lots of kick

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,000
that's a kick

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,680
legend's ultimate indica question

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
let me see if i can do it this way real

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,000
quick

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
yeah it's only showing the requests

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,199
let's see

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,519
it's not an order so i'm still looking

66
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,518
for kip hopefully to find if he's in

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,519
here

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
it always makes it better when you can

69
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,399
have the whole crew if we can pull it

70
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,199
off

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
i'm not here yet

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
yeah dude

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,319
boomin boomer i'm a straight boomer when

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
it comes to electronics apparently

75
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,158
okay

76
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,158
well should we just run with chimera

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,840
let's do it

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,840
so we can get this jamming

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,639
and hopefully um

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
hopefully if kip does come in we can try

81
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,039
to add him in i might be able to do it

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,318
that way

83
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,479
what's up

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,280
it's right

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,199
here we tried all right so we're already

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,318
getting questions about legends ultimate

87
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,878
indica

88
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,679
did you work on that one at all

89
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,840
no that was kip and steve well it was

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,840
really it was kit but did it

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,560
um was

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,719
robot and yes that i saw him

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,039
chirping away there he's really

94
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,560
smart good grower you guys should follow

95
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,719
him if you're not already he does some

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,318
really interesting [ __ ]

97
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,280
um definitely

98
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,119
the ultimate indica is such a classic

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
[ __ ] story

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,719
you know back in the day yeah

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
when they were getting switzerland off

102
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,719
the ground

103
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,158
the you know the the the

104
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,598
what was it i guess they call it ended

105
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,959
up calling it sweet two 23 but it was

106
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,238
like a third back cross to the

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
grapefruit

108
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,599
you know kind of like i say

109
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,719
you know you know breeders that don't

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
know what they're doing they kind of

111
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
rely heavily on back crossing hope that

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
that just hoping that that solves it

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,759
solves it all out

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
um

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
anyway

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
gip you know kipp was

117
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,000
owned legends and he steve actually

118
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,120
owned a part of legends at that point in

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
time

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,319
and so you know

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
kip was over there working in

122
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,639
switzerland at the warehouse in the

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,439
field

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,478
and he was supposed to get paid

125
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,719
you know a big chunk of uh

126
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,240
the compensation was in those sweet two

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,840
three beans that had been really hyped

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
up for a year because steven had steve

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,478
hadn't been working right he kind of was

130
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,279
like yeah and the game out of stock and

131
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,639
that was the much anticipated release

132
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,758
and so

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,360
you know

134
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
had suspected that he would be getting

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
oh what he was promised was he would be

136
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,000
getting a large portion of the sweet two

137
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,680
three seeds

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,759
that were to be pre-marketed so he could

139
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
just turn around and sell those things

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
and when they were loading up when they

141
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,799
were loading up the room i guess they

142
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,319
had a few extra lights like maybe you

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,038
know like

144
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,240
10 15 of the lights in the room

145
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,519
where they didn't have enough grapefruit

146
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,120
plants to go in

147
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,560
so he took the artic they had all these

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,399
ortega plants that were sticking around

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
that had rose and solid brought over to

150
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,359
switzerland

151
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
or sorry he brought over the genetic and

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,879
they'd mod them up and you know had

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
these extra plants

154
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
and so kids said well why don't we just

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
why don't we toss these in the room

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
we've got the space anyway let's toss

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
these up these uh ortega plants in and

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,079
make an f1 hybrid

159
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:46,959
and

160
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,758
so

161
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,159
when the crop finally came down

162
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
you know steve

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
i'm gonna pay you in these

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
untested f1 hybrid seeds rather than the

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
sweet two three seeds

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,560
which was it was kind of a bummer i

167
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,600
think forget because you know yeah of

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,839
course

169
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,039
pre-work and those ones were pre-sold

170
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,000
really

171
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,199
yeah

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,360
but instead he got those the the ortega

173
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,199
sweet 2 3 f1 hybrid or f1 type hybrid

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,759
and so he came back to canada and he had

175
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
a couple of shows here and they

176
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
threw a bunch of um

177
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
they threw a bunch of the what became

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
the lui in that room to test them out

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,959
and grow them before they saw them and

180
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,719
they turned out to be actually quite

181
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,680
banger plants like they really yeah they

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,919
are

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,639
some real f1 hybrid figure i didn't love

184
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,959
the flavor on them but it was like you

185
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
know it was a grower's plant

186
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,680
and if you were

187
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,199
like it made [ __ ] incredible hash

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,478
so

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
here's some of my heady bread is saying

190
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,000
that lui sampled from sativa's sisters

191
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,598
in 2004 it was covered in large

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
trigramas that would snow all over the

193
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,680
plate when broken up heavy stone that

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,439
was the cut that they called we ended up

195
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
calling red's pick

196
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,240
which is fine oh was that red

197
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,478
yeah that was the one

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,319
and it was it's you know like dude it

199
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,598
was an amazing plant like it really i

200
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
don't know actually it was an amazing

201
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,159
plant it was amazing growing plant

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,918
and you'd you know you'd lock the tops

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,319
off the off the thing at six weeks

204
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,159
because they were so big and beefy that

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
you'd have mold if you didn't

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
so yeah that kind of became the cash

207
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,598
croppers method as you come in and lock

208
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,519
the tops off them at six weeks and then

209
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,719
give the the rest like another 10 days

210
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,159
or whatever

211
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
yeah

212
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
and uh yeah really popular clone i mean

213
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,560
[ __ ] dude that guy ended up they had a

214
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,439
clone house as well and

215
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,519
like

216
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,439
it you know they sold trays and trays

217
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,120
and trays that cloned that thing for

218
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,680
well over a year

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,360
and it made all over the place

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
so yeah

221
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
that's crazy

222
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,240
yeah interesting interesting plant

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,240
did it end up selling well in seed form

224
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,038
pretty well like i think i would think

225
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,478
so

226
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,918
yeah i think it took like six or eight

227
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,359
months before it really caught on you

228
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,198
know you know what it is

229
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,800
it takes a cycle for someone to go

230
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,400
through it and then

231
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,960
you know you gotta you know say you send

232
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,038
out 20 30 packs of seeds

233
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,719
yeah really it takes one person that has

234
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,560
a really good job that does a good job

235
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,080
with it too yeah that's kind of

236
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,879
advertise it and that kind of makes it

237
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,079
wrong

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,439
and by that point in time they really

239
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,199
did roll and they were they started

240
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,639
selling well

241
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,840
and uh

242
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
yeah

243
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,478
so there's a here's one for you moon

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,439
tide says chimera do you think you could

245
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:33,598
be bringing back the blueberry of dj's

246
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,599
heyday the more sativa side

247
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,439
probably not in the same way that he

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,599
could i mean you know what it's like

249
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
it's like yeah

250
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,640
you know you might have them like an

251
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,320
impression of your buddy's girlfriend

252
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,919
but you're never going to know her like

253
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,839
your buddy yeah

254
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,079
right and that's kind of how i feel with

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,120
it with with the blueberry stuff it's

256
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,519
something that dj's got his own

257
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
vision of what it is

258
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
um

259
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,879
and you know i think that to get close

260
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,159
to what he's doing

261
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,759
here you know

262
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,480
he'd be the person to go back and find

263
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,679
something that was close to what it was

264
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,159
we've put out a couple of things i mean

265
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,000
in our blueberry hybrid lines like the

266
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,319
the fighting buddha and then you know

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
the dolce line

268
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
i would probably go down those paths

269
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,320
more than try to go down

270
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,319
like what to work on

271
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,240
yeah that makes sense

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,839
yeah so i hunted down the um

273
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,039
i hunted down the

274
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,640
the

275
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,719
the blue bonnet path this last time

276
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,720
which is the more afghani type and i

277
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
always had it in my head that

278
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
because most of the examples that i'd

279
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,958
seen that were super blueberry muffin

280
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,639
smelling

281
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,559
typically were more narrow leaf type

282
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,319
plants i thought that

283
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,079
i was not going to see it as as

284
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
prevalent in the afghani type but i saw

285
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,278
it more prevalent in the afghani type

286
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,559
from that specific line it's really

287
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,200
interesting

288
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,039
yeah i think that those

289
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
those generalizations that were put on

290
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,039
the the line like we you know we read

291
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,399
about like the moon time old-time

292
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,000
moonshine essentially being like

293
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
you know the frosty indica it's not

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,559
necessarily clear-cut like that like

295
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,559
you'll find no again because they're all

296
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,159
siblings or half-siblings

297
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,039
you kind of find little bits of each

298
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,078
other in every line right

299
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,159
yeah

300
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,078
they're more predominantly like like the

301
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,799
old-time moonshine is more predominantly

302
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,239
like that but yeah

303
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,278
yeah did you get to run through any of

304
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,039
them moonshine rocket

305
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,720
i fuel uh

306
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,919
no i didn't that was one of them didn't

307
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
i guess yeah i couldn't remember what

308
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,519
era he did that

309
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,439
that was one of the first releases that

310
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,120
he did and it was like right off the bat

311
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
right off the bat they were like in

312
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,919
limited supply

313
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,519
i i worked with him but we you know i

314
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,599
was one of the early

315
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,879
clients to be buying pollen from him he

316
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,720
you know he had set up these things and

317
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,639
was going to be selling pollen

318
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
and so i sent him like a bunch of money

319
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,240
early on for that

320
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,000
and um it just never showed up like the

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,278
stuff that showed up it was so poorly

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
packaged

323
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,600
um yeah like you just we couldn't have

324
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
made it a bit like in my opinion there

325
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,879
was no business there

326
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,278
and he ended up replacing with a bunch

327
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,958
of the blue what was the satellite the

328
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,519
satellite number two

329
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,439
so i i got like 150 of those in exchange

330
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,278
for the pollen that didn't work

331
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
and we grew a bunch of them in

332
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,159
california i wasn't actually that

333
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,639
impressed with that line like i was

334
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,639
surprised for being a hybrid

335
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,278
it was still pretty [ __ ] inbred like

336
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,039
it was still weak

337
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,320
and we found a couple of really nice

338
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,838
like

339
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,079
again not nice plants but the plants

340
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,200
that had nice variegation in them yeah

341
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,479
like really

342
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
some really interesting kind of

343
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,120
phenotypical patterns

344
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,639
but nothing that was banging and you

345
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,560
know like i said we tested all that

346
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,639
stuff too and ran it through the lab

347
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,838
and it all came back at like

348
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
years ago

349
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,839
it all came back at like you know eight

350
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
to twelve percent

351
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,600
which is pretty low right

352
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
um

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,029
yeah

354
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
yeah so

355
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,600
[Music]

356
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,800
you know like and i think that that's

357
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,240
actually where the dj gets the

358
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,799
you know you hear people talking about

359
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,879
that kind of cerebral head space

360
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,639
yeah i think that that actually is a

361
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,240
result not of

362
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,480
the terpenes and the chemistry it's

363
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,879
actually a result of the low cannabinoid

364
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,879
content

365
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,159
yeah

366
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,799
my technical abilities at this stage in

367
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,600
a week are really limited guys it was

368
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,639
more my fault than yours

369
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,639

370
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,360
so for those that don't know this is uh

371
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,839

up all night i mean kip is

387
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,720
you know he disappeared from the scene

388
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,480
for a while but

389
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,240
you know he hasn't really i don't think

390
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
you've ever really gotten your dues for

391
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
the amount of stuff that you put in i

392
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,919
know it's not about ego or

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
becoming popular or anything like that

394
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,439
for for you you do it out of love for

395
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,439
the plant but man you've done some

396
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
pretty epic stuff back in the day and

397
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,800
like i was telling matt earlier

398
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,319
you know the work that you're doing with

399
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,000
shelter and helping them get that

400
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
company off the ground

401
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,519
and buying hundreds of kilos and making

402
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,560
pre-rolls and selling across the market

403
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,320
i mean

404
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,319
they're the consumers are lucky in

405
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
canada to have that kind of [ __ ] because

406
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
you know as you know the game is pretty

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,078
weak right so it's nice to see people

408
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,039
that are out there

409
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,559
um

410
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,000
making making a change and actually

411
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,039
putting stuff out that's a reasonable

412
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,639
price and it gets good reviews

413
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,240
yeah

414
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,198
but guys i mean i have a dream job um i

415
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,240
am one of the most fortunate people

416
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,879
that i know i'm i'm humbled every day i

417
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,959
mean i guys i get to buy weed for a

418
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:23,198
living and pay taxes

419
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,078
right right it's a trip man it's a trip

420
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,799
um

421
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,638
and that said i get to see the good the

422
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,559
bad the ugly across

423
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,799
this beautiful country of ours and

424
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,518
what's going on and

425
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,399
man the you know the fake news that some

426
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,159
of these small outfits get and when they

427
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,480
come into the scene and are trying to

428
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,319
spread their flower and just like yeah

429
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,039
it's so tough like all the cars are

430
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,519
stacked so far against us here right now

431
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,838
um that you know what i'm loving is

432
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,360
finding small bands of villages that

433
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
bind together and help each other out

434
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,680
through processors and vendors and

435
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,039
distributors and um and just you know

436
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,399
everybody kind of pat each other on the

437
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,958
back and trying to lift each other up

438
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,919
but uh the ankle biters will succeed in

439
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,479
the end

440
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,519
yeah yeah it does tend to happen so

441
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,769
great garden says most wreck in canada

442
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,039
is boof though

443
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:17,120
[Laughter]

444
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,679
it's not you know here's the problem why

445
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,120
somebody would uh say that

446
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,198
the provinces they really they they like

447
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
they capture everything in that province

448
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,799
you can't get national distribution it's

449
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
next to impossible from you know

450
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,198
newfoundland to victoria to get the same

451
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,919
weed across and to get someone's vision

452
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,278
out there it's so regionalized and it's

453
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,360
ridiculous because

454
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,919
if you think about the taxation the big

455
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,519
that the province uh put on as far as

456
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,838
you know the warehousing and the

457
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,839
distribution that they are obviously

458
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,880
aware of uh or sorry that they are

459
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,399
obviously a part of um you know

460
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,159
it's it's they're like their own little

461
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
fighters like their own little countries

462
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,399
each it's like you know having a 12th

463
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,440
country in a massive continent that you

464
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,519
have to deal with uh it's so hard so you

465
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,720
know you get a micro cultivator that

466
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,159
pumps out maybe 30 40 paging a month

467
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
and you know where does that go well

468
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,319
that gets eaten up by one province in a

469
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,480
matter of like six weeks if it's fire

470
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,800
you know it's gone and man there's some

471
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,720
good weed out there there's some amazing

472
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:23,599
growers out there um there's 200 micros

473
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,440
plus in in candle right now

474
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,320
and so are you telling me that all legal

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
weeds buff well i just by the numbers i

476
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
don't believe i think it's [ __ ] i

477
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,479
mean i know better i've i've puffed it

478
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,320
i've seen the grows i've walked in that

479
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,720
and those guys flip ups uh along the way

480
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,879
when shelter first got their first micro

481
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
that was gord from north 40 and he was

482
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,480
the first micro cannabis that was

483
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,599
branded under his name in canada

484
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,000
and you know now we've got 242 years

485
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,000
later man it's a trip

486
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,759
you know yeah dude

487
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
what now what what qualifies someone as

488
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,480
a micro license in canada what's the

489
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,599
qualifications for that yeah so a micro

490
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,558
license is 21.25 so basically you can

491
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,798
only have 2125 square feet of canopy in

492
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,879
your facility okay gotcha

493
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,199
and that includes your moms your clones

494
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
your cuts your production plants all

495
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
that kind of stuff

496
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,318
um but i mean the good ones know how to

497
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,720
do it right it's all about my fault in

498
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,078
the plant knowing your genetics

499
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,318
knowing your

500
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:29,279
system um yeah

501
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:31,440
and and implementing the [ __ ] you know i

502
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,038
got a micro up here man he's almost

503
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
pumping out like

504
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,839
on average probably 60 kg a month out of

505
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,159
that canopy so it's just about the

506
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,558
special sauce and the formula

507
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,470
shocking it's all kush but you know

508
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,440
yeah right right

509
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,120
[Laughter]

510
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,160
yeah it's it's knowing your strains

511
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,519
knowing how they're going to express in

512
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,840
that particular environment and making

513
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,279
them shine for for what you have

514
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,798
that's it and i also have an

515
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,000
understanding for what the market needs

516
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,639
to yeah that's part of it right yeah um

517
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,880
it's not like we're all back in the day

518
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
growing bad warehouses and throwing into

519
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
some truck into the void

520
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,400
yeah exactly

521
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,319
you know um we actually have to be

522
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,080
responsible for what we put out now hey

523
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,839
that a [ __ ] yeah

524
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,519
right

525
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,759
right yeah you've seen a lot of the

526
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,720
collapse in the market that we've seen

527
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,319
in

528
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
the us

529
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,359
well there's a collapse in the [ __ ] part

530
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,280
of the market for sure yeah for sure but

531
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,839
like here in the us it's like i mean

532
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:33,599
things are hitting really low numbers

533
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:36,240
all across the board like 350 for for uh

534
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,639
last i saw anyways was 350 for depths

535
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,359
which is insane per pound

536
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,520
so

537
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,678
yeah i mean you know i don't feel so bad

538
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,038
canada's got the cheapest legal weed in

539
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,038
the entire globe man

540
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,240
you're not gonna get some strings for

541
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
you guys come on yes

542
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,599
how do you guys make that work up there

543
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,839
it's just

544
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,639
doing it right just you do it and that's

545
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,959
that

546
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
great question manny yeah [ __ ] blue

547
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,679
man

548
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,639
you know

549
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,640
efficiencies and scale smaller drops

550
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
straighter lines

551
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
less government bureaucracy as much as

552
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
we can

553
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,840
uh the fact is is that that's going to

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
be a slow arduous process listen i've

555
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,839
said this before one of the greatest

556
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,839
[ __ ]

557
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,159
injustices that's going on right now is

558
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,199
the excise tax that's a federal excise

559
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,960
tax it's a buck a gram yeah and on top

560
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,120
of that i mean i can go on to the five

561
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,038
layers of tax that come into this bloody

562
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,599
plant that's just the biggest egregious

563
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,879
one because that was based on wholesale

564
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,959
pricing via ten dollars a gram well that

565
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,919
ain't the wholesale pricing these days

566
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
no

567
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,880
no

568
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,439
so we're getting you're getting screwed

569
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,080
i mean the government makes 450 a gram

570
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
where where a producer could make a buck

571
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,038
like

572
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,960
it's [ __ ] criminal

573
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,839
absolutely brilliant

574
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
um

575
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,959
so anyways the fact is is that in order

576
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,759
to

577
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,759
excuse or to change an excise tax on any

578
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,879
level in canada it takes an actual

579
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,879
parliament

580
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,440
yeah

581
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,799
so that ain't happening anytime soon you

582
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,080
know yeah

583
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,839
until we get lobbyists an association

584
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,480
getting everyone together and backed

585
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,359
like every other goddamn ministry has to

586
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,759
push their agenda to push their goodwill

587
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,959
and their message uh to the rest of the

588
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,400
canadians

589
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,798
but you're not going to get that when

590
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,320
you've got large corporations and then

591
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,158
you've got the small guys all the

592
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,158
midfielders are being

593
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,760
they're being wasted and they're or

594
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,919
they're being bought up yeah they

595
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,798
haven't gonna have nots it's you know

596
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,640
small culture big company uh it's

597
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,519
playing out in canada in an exponential

598
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,759
way like a video game yeah

599
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,240
yeah and so i mean it's coming down

600
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,679
south soon you know the only reason

601
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,798
maddie it's not legal there yet because

602
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,559
they haven't figured out how to take all

603
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,400
the money yet but that's exactly it yeah

604
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,240
you really need lobbyists to make any

605
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,559
kind of headway anywhere when it comes

606
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,640
to government and taxes and any of it

607
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,599
and i think being that we're all a bunch

608
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
of

609
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,000
cowboys it's just

610
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,720
not our our specialty to be [ __ ] with

611
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,839
lobbyists it's new

612
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,839
yeah you know what we're

613
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
the next generation will say that they

614
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,119
stood on our shoulders as we for the

615
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,039
guys in the 70s before us and you know

616
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,519
back in the day so

617
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,319
we all have a part in this long story

618
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,720
and we're this chapter so we do what we

619
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,240

620
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,120

yeah right man you know like

622
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,599
okay so next step take it further you

623
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,038
know let's get hemp as is the only thing

624
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,199
that should be being grown across the

625
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,119
nation to save us from you know

626

yeah well i mean it was such a period of

639
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,119
time and i think a lot of people missed

like the johnny blaze and

643
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,759
you had a time warp blueberry line for a

644

657
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,200
preconditioned thoughts might have been

658
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,840
about that cat back in the day he was

659

662
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,399
he was

663
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,400
uh a wealth of knowledge and he was an

664
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,798
ambassador to a land we knew much not

665
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,519
much about back when we were young [ __ ]

666
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,519
running around europe so um yeah he was

667
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,440

691
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,480
to be a part of it some of the stuff

692
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,480
came out beautiful you know when you can

693
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,480
pick like six brackets off and just roll

694
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
them in a paper yeah yeah

695
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,400
i still have some of those seeds and i

696
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,440
actually used it in a project with the

697
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,200
strawberry cream line so still living

698
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,960
maddie how'd that turn out

699
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
um it i was trying to recreate the

700
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,558
strawberry cream um because it was a

701
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,079
clone

702
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,678
at the time i only knew it as a clone

703
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,278
from cedarbury farms

704
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,278
and i was trying to recreate it and i

705
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,359
noticed in the room that it was next to

706
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,359
the the old blue dream santa cruz cut

707
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,119
and i noticed like looking at them you

708
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,879
could barely tell any difference and the

709
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,558
nose was only slightly more strawberry

710
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
in the strawberry frame but it had a lot

711
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,158
of the similar smells so i was like

712
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,440
if i want to create this i need a male

713
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
that's going to be something similar so

714
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,640
i went for the johnny blaze and that

715
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,880
line still sold today it's it's awesome

716
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,840
dude it's one of my favorite lines ever

717
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,799
that makes me want to hear it dude

718
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,798
yeah dude they're killers

719
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,158
that was six the when we made those

720
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,440

721
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,440
um

722
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,120

my favorite one but again my favorite

750
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,759
one that we ran was the high end that

751
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,599
would be the renee blueberry i never got

752
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,839
to try that one i i've always wanted to

753
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,678
try is renae still around

754
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,918
yeah the original cut i don't have my

755
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,640
hands on that thing hurt me back like 30

756
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,640
years ago i can't imagine

757
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,400
yeah it was actually that that plant as

758
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,919
as hyped as it got

759
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
it actually had some really negative

760
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,919
traits like you'd be growing like a week

761
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,319
seven it would shoot a banana and then

762
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,679
just ripen

763
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,599
it was like it would just kind of stop

764
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,600
growing it was a really weird one

765
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,278
yeah um

00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,519
were like a sixth speed company on the

999
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,079
internet the worldwide web

1000
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,039
uh at the time and um so it was pretty

1001
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,119
all new right and so all we could do is

1002
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,358
go across the amsterdam buy a bunch of

1003
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,280
seed come back and you know and sell it

1004
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,559
there you know so resell it and then i

1005
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,760
started getting to know the canadian

1006
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:32,880
growers and one of my old partners knew

1007
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:36,320
um ed uh rosenthal and uh he had gotten

1008
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,079
uh basically his hands on neville's last

1009
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,800
selections in cali before he went back

1010
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,079
to the office before he got busted yeah

1011
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
and so

1012
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,160
uh we got our hand those were dubbed the

1013
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,960
seed bank originals

1014
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,799
and um so we got a chance to uh and

1015
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,639
these were and we had our hands on they

1016
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,320
were like 25 30 year old seeds you know

1017
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,078
and yeah

1018
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
perfectly let's just put it that way i

1019
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,760
mean there was probably 35 40 germ rates

1020
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,400
but what we were looking for was

1021
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,119
building blocks to what all the cannabis

1022
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,320
is we know today let's be frank you know

1023
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,240
um this is this has to do with skunk man

1024
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,519
it has to do with all those cats and we

1025
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,078
all know who we're talking about like

1026
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,519
the big fab four as it were yeah um the

1027
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,359
guys that

1028
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,440
are the only reasons the three of us are

1029
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,480
talking to each other right now um yeah

1030
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,559
really and

1031
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,920
and the people oh it is it's

1032
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,279
the founding father the mount rushmore

1033
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,320
of cannabis

1034
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,320
i agree

1035
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,400
you know um

1036
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,400
right like dudes

1037
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,400
i still i think i know of every

1038
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,079
interaction i've ever had with dave i

1039
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,079
know that ryan would like to forget a

1040
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,079
few

1041
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,358
only because he's the most cantankerous

1042
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,040
old man who's always right

1043
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,920
and god love him for christ's sakes

1044
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,920
because he usually is

1045
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,039
to rob you know

1046
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,039
to neville you know it's howard marks

1047
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,440
even if you want to go to that clue that

1048
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,679
i mean yeah it's been drunkers for

1049
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,358
craig's sakes like anyway

1050
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,919
so long story short as we got those

1051
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,679
seeds uh through a partnership and we

1052
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,400
were allowed to uh we got a chance to

1053
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,679
actually sell them up on legends and uh

1054
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,760
a lot of folks got a lot of building

1055
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,358
blocks like calio was one of my best

1056
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
hidden secrets on that one and the

1057
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,759
ortega three both of those were my

1058
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,200
favorite you had three artigas three

1059
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,079
yeah we had the one two and three it was

1060
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,199
a hash plant cross a cushcross and a

1061
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,359
skunk crush awesome awesome um we had

1062
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,199
the original ortega in switzerland and

1063
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,279
that thing was just buttons of hash i

1064
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,598
mean it was the purest hashtag

1065
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,599
one of the closer land race hash plants

1066
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,280
i'd ever seen to this day to be quite

1067
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,880
frank and what i would know because it

1068
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,640
wasn't bulked up but the resin was the

1069
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,440
the most intense resin i'd ever had it

1070
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,559
was so greasy we had those old damn

1071
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,000
shakers

1072
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,759
you know you put that drive button at

1073
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
the top and it had this silly screen you

1074
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,119
just yeah yeah

1075
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,039
yeah

1076
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,680
you know right like i don't know they

1077
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,920
they were camouflaged they were so funny

1078
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,838
yeah so we have one of those uh at the

1079
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,039
facility in switzerland and that

1080
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,199
everyone would always do it with the

1081
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,679
ortega because it would just puke it up

1082
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,559
like like there's huge fat heads under

1083
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,919
the microscope and dark and greasy as

1084
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,519
all hell like

1085
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,760
super greasy

1086
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,679
and now that i know what mir seen

1087
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,520

1094
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,680
hash backs with your 15 hash bags a day

1095
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,760
that's crazy

1096
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,199
yeah so so that's my experience with

1097

those seats and they're again just

1098
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,759
building blocks that's what i always

1099
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,200
radically manage

1100
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,480

friend of ours brought those over for us

1116
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,560

1117
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,519
suitcase yeah that's awesome and they

1118
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,119
made it

1119
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,199
and they made it and

1120
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,880
sold a lot of clones over in europe and

1121
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,639
uh you know i'm sure we started a lot of

1122
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,200
breeding lines

1123
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,960
oh yeah

1124
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,799
so what what was so special about calio

1125
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,800
for you

1126
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,920
the flavor uh it was the first time i

1127
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,920
experienced any kind of um

1128
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,280
what i know now to be limoney limonene

1129
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
terpenoline um i didn't know it then

1130
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,320
obviously i didn't have the knowledge

1131
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,240
understanding of the vocabulary or the

1132
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,559
coas in front of me yeah um but um that

1133
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,719
i know now and so it was that i'm a

1134
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,400
terpenoline junkie i mean if i could do

1135
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,159
lines of it all day i would i swear i

1136
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,519
could do i do that

1137
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,399
i think it makes everything taste way

1138
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,199
better

1139
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,200
birds of a feather

1140
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,000
some people hate it it's just one of

1141
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,000
those things like if you love it you can

1142
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,440
appreciate how much it adds to flavor

1143
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,440
and the high yeah yeah

1144
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,079
agreed you know it's funny because i

1145
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,440
find the selling to this generation

1146
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,920
they're all gas heads you know like

1147

1148
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,159
the tropicals [ __ ] the exotics give me

1149
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,839
gas give me gas i just share it all day

1150
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,099
and i just start feeling like an old man

1151
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,360
sometimes

1152
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:35,360
[Laughter]

1153
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,159

1154
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,880
kick me in my head if i don't ask both

1155
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,279
of you what is the most

1156
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,200

1159
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,680
uh like a skunk that's been run over a

1160
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,960
mile away that kind of skunk what's the

1161
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,440
most traditionally skunk lines you've

1162
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
come across

1163
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,880
and it was called bc skunk

1164
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,679
back in the day that bc

1165
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,880
like

1166
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,799
yeah like early 90s and you know

1167
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,440
i remember hearing about like as a

1168
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,440
name-branded thing before i knew that

1169
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,318
you knew that there was branded cannabis

1170
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,079
or named cannabis varieties right

1171
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,519
yeah um

1172
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
but you know what happened i mean

1173
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,838
everybody stopped growing it because it

1174
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
was

1175
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,279
you know during the the kicker during

1176
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,239
period of time

1177
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,160
yeah

1178
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,519
you know you'd lose it

1179
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,118
um where people would you know you could

1180
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,199
have the cops showing up in your in your

1181
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,760
house everybody stopped growing it

1182
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,480
but um they've recently identified a

1183
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,400
chemical uh like i i can't remember what

1184
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,719
it is it's like one mbt i'd have to look

1185
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,240
it up because it's got a name like this

1186
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,000
but they've actually identified the

1187
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,439
compound that's actually responsible for

1188
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,480
that smell

1189
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
so

1190
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,400
you know

1191
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,880
style ester

1192
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,639
um i think it's an aldehyde

1193
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,480
i'm i'm actually not an alphabet

1194
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,159
again i'd have to look it up

1195
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,079
listen that would make sense though just

1196
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,598
from the putrid of it with putridness of

1197
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,599
it do you know what i mean yeah well

1198
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,480
yeah the very the fact you just need a

1199
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,039
little bit that has a big effect but

1200
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,159
the point is that you

1201
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,639
once you once you know what blip

1202
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,159
it is on the chromatograph

1203
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,358
it's pretty easy to start picking up

1204
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,519
plants that have higher amounts

1205
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:27,078
in it right so

1206
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,079
yeah um

1207
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,838
um

1208
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,440
but

1209
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:41,880
anyway whatever i'm not a chemistry nerd

1210
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,880
in the type of like yeah

1211
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:50,099
[Laughter]

1212
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,000
and then once you find it then you just

1213
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,679
start breeding it it'll come up like

1214
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,440
that's what we do

1215
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,960
right we've done it with thc that's the

1216
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,559
last dvd

1217
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,760
sorry

1218
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,279
that's the lab reading you were talking

1219
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,440
about in the podcast

1220
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
and and the the expense of it is quite

1221
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,318
quite right to be doing it right

1222
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,519
yeah yeah you have to do you have to

1223
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,679
take it listen when once you've done it

1224
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,358
you won't go back to the other way like

1225
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,358
i guarantee it

1226
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,880
or you'll you'll cry to have to go back

1227
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,480
to the other way and you'll just you'll

1228
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
do everything you can including selling

1229
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,119
your children to like find a way to pay

1230
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,240
for the test right

1231
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,358
yeah

1232
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,358
because it's it's like it's so

1233
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,639
night and day difference between doing

1234
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,318
it the old school way just on your nose

1235
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,039
you know i've had a lot of people kind

1236
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:49,838
of like be quite resistant to the whole

1237
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,599
lab-led breeding thing

1238
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,039
or the science-led breeding thing and

1239
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,720
the truth is dude

1240
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,960
it's it doesn't take anything away from

1241
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,959
the way that we've always been doing it

1242
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,000
it just gives you another set of data to

1243
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,880
look at

1244
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,800
and to refine your knowledge like

1245
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,480
when i finally got access to the lab we

1246
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,079
would grow hundreds of hundreds of

1247
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,838
plants from across

1248
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,800
and i would save a little nug for each

1249
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:14,639
of them

1250
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,400
and then when i had the labs in front of

1251
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,799
me i'd go through them individual by

1252
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,240
individual look at the lab report not

1253
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,680
even looking at the butt just looking at

1254
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,239
the lab report and holding the butt

1255
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,000
underneath my nose and rolling yeah yeah

1256
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,399
right and then and going through them

1257
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,800
sequentially

1258
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,240
to try to train my nose to like what is

1259
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,560
okay so i know that there's a slight

1260
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:38,399
difference in the cell and the smell can

1261
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,400
i see that on the graphs yeah right

1262
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,000
because we make graphs and everything so

1263
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,720
that um

1264
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,960
i find when you have lists of of

1265
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,239
like terpene names and terpene values is

1266
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,079
like a

1267
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,919
you know like 1.3

1268
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,920
7 whatever whatever expresses a

1269
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,519
percentage it's kind of meaningless

1270
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,880
right because you're kind of like always

1271
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,559
scrolling through the list and trying to

1272
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,079
add it up in your head

1273
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,039
when you take those numbers and you make

1274
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,880
a graphical representation of them

1275
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,279
you know we did graphical

1276
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,800
like essentially peak line

1277
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,839
bar graphs so that you could see the

1278
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,920
quantity

1279
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,239
but we also made every terp its own

1280
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,240
color

1281
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,318
and in that way

1282
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,078
like it was a pain in the ass at first

1283
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,400
because you'd have to remember oh yeah

1284
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,560
pinene is green osmine is orange

1285
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,519
beta-carotene is blue

1286
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,719
but

1287
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,880
you know after a hundred lab

1288
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,480
like a samples

1289
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,240
you knew which was which

1290
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,920
and so you didn't even have to like look

1291
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,838
down a column and see how much beta

1292
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
caryophyllene is there you would look at

1293
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,679
the graph immediately and be like boom

1294
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,440
they have carry beta caryophyllene is

1295
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,759
the highest peak

1296
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,159
right yeah and then what that did is it

1297
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,160
was it kind of reduced the scent

1298
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,759
picture

1299
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,000
into a graphical representation that

1300
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,960
your brain could recognize on a more

1301
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,119
productive

1302
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,240
notice you were being taught and you

1303
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,358
didn't know you were being taught

1304
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,679
exactly

1305
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,679
exactly i don't know that's right

1306
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,839
when when ryan got back from california

1307
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,519
he and he showed this

1308
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,838
he explained this all to me

1309
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:21,358
i i felt like literally i was the

1310
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,920
dumbest person in cannabis

1311
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,679
um you know and mariah has such a

1312
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,519
beautiful way of being able to describe

1313
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,039
things to people and bring it down to

1314
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,639
its lowest common denominator so you

1315
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,960
have full understanding

1316
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,559
uh and it's just it's amazing sorry ron

1317
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,760
i had to bust that out because uh the

1318
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,159
way you've explained it is really

1319
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,160
perfect

1320
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,639
yeah well it was you know we listen i

1321
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,400
got lucky working with mark lewis and

1322
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,159
matt geezy i mean they're both top

1323
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,000
top-notch chemists

1324
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,759
and so it was really like kind of

1325
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,358
spoiling to not have to figure that

1326
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,960
whole component out

1327
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,400
right it was like these are the

1328
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,240
chemicals that we want to be looking at

1329
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,000
and they would go and do all the work

1330
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,078
right and then come back with these lab

1331
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,760
reports that were just [ __ ] like

1332
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,920
super informative and like i said you

1333
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,520
could glance at two graphs somebody

1334
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,519
asked if it was a spider graph there was

1335
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,039
a spider craft for flavor

1336
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,039
but we essentially had a series of

1337
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,400
graphs that did

1338
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,279
you know you'd have you'd have a series

1339
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,039
of graphs in a all on different rows but

1340
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,880
one individual would be on a column

1341
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,639
going through all the graphs

1342
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
and so just by looking at these four

1343
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,118
graphs you can get an idea of which

1344
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,240
plant was had the most oh look steve had

1345
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,599
was here

1346
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,279
plant the haba

1347
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,599
he's uh actually someone that's been

1348
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,000
doing work with these same graphs

1349
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,039
that i'm just talking about oh awesome

1350
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,239
uh

1351
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,880
hobbit for those of you that don't

1352
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,199
follow him is he was kind of behind the

1353
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,240
lemon crush that won the

1354
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,759
emerald cup a few years ago i think

1355
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:47,118
2017. oh wow

1356
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,119
um

1357
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,800
very very talented and educated plant

1358
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,760
breeder in his own right

1359
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,760
um

1360
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,760
but yeah like when you have the tools to

1361
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,599
be able to like essentially visualize

1362
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,839
these things that we call smell

1363
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,519
you know like here like for example when

1364
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,838
we when you smell something you're not

1365
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,400
smelling one thing you're smelling an

1366
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,838
orchestra of compounds all together at

1367
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,599
the same time

1368
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,000
right and so it's kind of like listening

1369
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,599
to a symphony or like a like a piece of

1370
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,920
classical music

1371
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,838
you don't necessarily hear

1372
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,318
like the

1373
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:24,239
oboe right yeah unless unless you really

1374
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,759
train your ear and then you learn how to

1375
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,279
like pick out the oboe in that overall

1376
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,359
mix

1377
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,680
right so

1378
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,480
um

1379
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,078
yeah

1380
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,760
it's

1381
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,280
it's something that we haven't done well

1382
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,640
even amongst the cannabis breeding

1383
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,720
community but i think that we need to

1384
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,719
really do that there's a book in

1385
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,439
if only a book that david watson showed

1386
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:52,239
that has called lenee duvang and it's

1387
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,079
it's it means the nose of wine and it's

1388
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,159
a book that you open it up it's got like

1389
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,000
i don't know 20 or 30 little vials that

1390
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,799
have all the different scents that you

1391
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,960
know

1392
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,640
like smoke and leather and tobacco like

1393
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,639
all the notes that they use to describe

1394
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,759
yeah sorry

1395
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,960
wine

1396
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,359
and so i've always wanted to do one of

1397
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,519
those like a really complete one

1398
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:13,920
for cannabis right that would have all

1399
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,599
the terpenes yeah you have a bunch of

1400
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,920
you know a bunch of

1401
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,119
um like all these other volatiles we're

1402
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,119
talking about the aldehydes and the

1403
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,720
esters and files whatever you can get

1404
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,519
your hands on

1405
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,439
and

1406
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,599
you know put a little booklet with it so

1407
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,358
that you can really put this out because

1408
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,880
right now we have like i mean there's

1409
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,400
some people that are kind of starting to

1410
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,480
figure it out

1411
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,079
just because like for example kip like

1412
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,000
kip's in a job

1413
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,440
where he has hundreds of growers

1414
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,679
contacting him all the time looking to

1415
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,318
sell our weed and he needs a way to be

1416
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,759
able to separate segregate like what's

1417
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,079
the good from the bad

1418
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,720
and so the tool that we have now is a

1419
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,000
lab report you know show me the coa and

1420
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:53,519
it brings you the you know the

1421
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,039
certificate analysis and of course it

1422
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,719
tells you how much cannabinoids are in

1423
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,480
it because that's important everybody on

1424
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,759
the rec market wants to know that thc is

1425
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,760
that

1426
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,839
but more importantly

1427
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,960
it becomes

1428
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,199
about

1429
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,199
um

1430
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:11,039
about scent right and like you have to

1431
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,960
have some kind of lab measure and so

1432
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,639
when you're sorting through like

1433
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,599
hundreds of samples of weed that people

1434
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,879
are trying to

1435
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,160
sell you

1436
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,318
you can you're seeing all the lab

1437
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:21,759
reports you get you can actually start

1438
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,480
it's like oh look here's one that's

1439
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,400
pining dominant all the mercy one

1440
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,838
dominant ones go into another pile and

1441
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,200
the three penalty and dominant ones go

1442
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,440
into another pile

1443
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,199
and you can see it's like it's kind of

1444
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,400
just like taking a shuffled pack of

1445
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,919
cards

1446
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,960
like face up

1447
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,800
and then sorting them into their suits

1448
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,480
right like when you when you start

1449
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,119
looking at them only based on the

1450
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,679
chemistry you you realize that it's like

1451
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,838
oh there's just a bunch of categories

1452
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,639
right and then yeah everything falls

1453
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:54,880
into one of those categories

1454
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,118
do you have any idea how much mercy

1455
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,920
better carry offline limiting i see in a

1456
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:02,400
day what the hell do you think that is

1457
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,400
like the guys

1458
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,680
i see

1459
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,159
but i don't even need to see the sample

1460
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:12,558
i'm just like yeah okay i got it

1461
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:16,480
[Laughter]

1462
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,480
you have some form of kosher chicken

1463
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,319
i've been digging into the rosin stash a

1464
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,800
little bit lately and going through and

1465
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:27,440
you know i'm finding plants that when we

1466
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,119
separate out the rosin you can actually

1467
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,039
i can tell they have the same terpene

1468
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,280
profile but they have like different

1469
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,119
profiles about all the hives or esters

1470
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,119
and so it's like you really get this

1471
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,119
idea where you can actually start to

1472
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,440
like we can break cannabis apart

1473
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,920
into you know cannabinoids terpenes

1474
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,760
aldehydes esters if there's maybe a

1475
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,119
thiol class then maybe that comes in

1476
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,599
there as well

1477
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,358
but it's really like in each of those

1478
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,880
scent molecules or not the cannabinoids

1479
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,318
because they're not scented but they're

1480
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,440
important

1481
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:03,039
is that it's really just us layering

1482
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,119
all these different combinations of the

1483
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,279
individual suits in every any chemical

1484
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,440
class be it like thc or cbd in the

1485
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,079
cannabinoid class or like yeah

1486
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,358
terpenaline or mercenary whatever you

1487
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,440
know

1488
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,598
in the terpene class and it's like we're

1489
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,280
just literally

1490
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,480
we can only put it together so many ways

1491
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,400
right but there's some of these

1492
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,920
chemicals that like if you put it on or

1493
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,599
you take it apart

1494
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,920
or you take this one chemical out it

1495
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,079
totally changes the scent

1496
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,800
right that makes sense so that that like

1497
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,440
beta-carotene nursing dominant class

1498
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,720
that is ever present on the market it's

1499
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,079
like oh gee

1500
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,799
yeah cookies and everything in that

1501
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,800
flavor class

1502
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,159
that's like those aren't even the

1503
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,760
chemicals that are responsible for that

1504
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,920
gassy scent

1505
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,839
right it's just right when they fall in

1506
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,240
that background and you get that scent

1507
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,558
modifier that's when you get like that

1508
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,959
really funk to it right

1509
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,880
again orchestra it's about the orchestra

1510
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,679
the and then

1511
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,519
yeah

1512
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,039
i think that that's where it becomes you

1513
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,519
know the crybaby was talking about

1514
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,599
perfumes earlier

1515
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,759
it's like that's what purple like being

1516
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,119
a perfume yeah is really about it's like

1517
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,559
you're learning how to put together

1518
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,119
these different it's like you're being a

1519
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,960
chef really right yeah really yeah and

1520
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,519
it's a it's a it's a super kind of

1521
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,639
deconstructive simplifying approach but

1522
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:24,318
like

1523
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,960
anybody that's really into this [ __ ]

1524
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:30,480
like i really suggest trying to do that

1525
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,358
like try to find a way where you can

1526
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,039
get yourself a bunch of lab profiles and

1527
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,039
the standards like having like i said

1528
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,199
either having all these different buds

1529
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,599
or even better this the like limonene

1530
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,000
and terpenoline and teaching yourself

1531
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,519
that palette um

1532
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,599
is like you

1533
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,519
you can't put into words how powerful it

1534
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,359
is because again when we're like look

1535
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,880
when we're talking about

1536
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:55,279
i'll show you one of our canadian funky

1537
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,079
50s but like when we're talking about

1538
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,760
like color you know we can both look at

1539
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,640
this and immediately understand what it

1540
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,160
is

1541
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,759
right like we have a reference point

1542
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,759
where we can both point to this and say

1543
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,440
look that is the [ __ ] color that

1544
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,040
we're talking about you can't do that

1545
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,599
with sent

1546
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:14,480
yeah because like you

1547
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,640
again because it's an orchestra of of

1548
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,199
scent

1549
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:21,039
you we can't point to any one part and

1550
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,639
without each having a common language

1551
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:24,960
agree that we're talking about the same

1552
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:28,400
thing and that's why you're here using

1553
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,119
these words like scenery or earthy or

1554
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,599
floral or herbal yeah but really like

1555
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:37,519
that's not [ __ ] helpful

1556
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,039
right like no no it isn't you know so

1557
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,039
and it's integrating one of those things

1558
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,279
it's like you have to you have to teach

1559
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,199
yourself that skill right

1560
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,040
and for breeding with the labs the fact

1561
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,558
that you can i mean the traditional

1562
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,798
method i mean we all agree is kind of

1563
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,359
like a shotgun mail method where you

1564
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,759
pick a male based on something just

1565
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,039
something and seeing how it breeds is

1566
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,640
completely different but if you know its

1567
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,480
actual terpene profile and everything

1568
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,318
you can actually see how he's breeding

1569
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,318
which is so much more important than

1570
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,679
than just the shotgun method

1571
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,519
like you said it's a whole other tool to

1572
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,039
add to the toolkit

1573
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,039
yeah and it's like you know i've also

1574
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,880
like i've also learned

1575
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,558
you know like

1576
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,720
once i have that set of tools i don't

1577
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,000
always have to rely on the lab

1578
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,759
right because it's like you might walk

1579
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,760
across and it's like i can recognize the

1580
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,280
profiles just because i recognize what

1581
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,960
the sentence i don't need to send that

1582
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,400
sample to a lab unless i'm trying to

1583
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,400
quantify

1584
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,838
right that's the other thing it's like

1585
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,160
you know the terping profile is kind of

1586
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:33,920
like the quality like what the type you

1587
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,679
know kind of like a really like a

1588
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,440
mendelian type way

1589
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,838
but really what you're also trying to do

1590
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,519
is breed up the level

1591
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,838
right and so that's where it's really

1592
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,920
important to have the lab it's like

1593
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,440
because it's kind of hard to do that

1594
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,119
without like

1595
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,119
you know if i handed you a three percent

1596
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,838
a four percent terpene but

1597
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,440
like almost everybody in this chat room

1598
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:57,519
including the people in the lab i think

1599
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,798
would have a hard time doing that

1600
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,719
yeah

1601
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:03,759
heinrich you can john miss on that

1602
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:05,279
it's just one of those things that's

1603
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,760
kind of hard to measure

1604
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,798
unless you have it yes you have a gc

1605
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,559
you know so

1606
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,159
yeah

1607
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,920
yeah chem one is one of those ones that

1608
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,199
test high like four to five percent

1609
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,639
mercy

1610
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,798
it's crazy it's so much different than

1611
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,159
the other chem dogs the chem one it's

1612
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,920
more nl5 haze based i think

1613
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,279
but it carries really high terpene

1614
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,280
content with the mercy

1615
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,679
yeah i've got all the fingerprints from

1616
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,640
those i collected all that stuff off of

1617
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,039
off of spy rock um

1618
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,558
so i'm not oh yeah

1619
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,519
that's where you can you tell us some

1620
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,519
spy rock stories

1621
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,040
can we have some spyro stories want to

1622
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,159
protect the enemies you don't have to

1623
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,920
you know

1624
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:50,960
you got to see some cool stuff out there

1625
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,880
right

1626
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,559
yeah well yeah i mean i went there first

1627
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,240
time in 2011 and it was like

1628
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,160
you know i it's hard to imagine the

1629
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:01,919
context of what it was like back then

1630
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,000
but it was a totally different world of

1631
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,039
course and i remember being so blown

1632
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,280
away

1633
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,279
um we were up there and at the time

1634
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,960
every property on spy rock there's like

1635
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,559
4 000 properties on there and like at

1636
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,280
the time every property

1637
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,000
and i don't think i'm being like

1638
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,720
too hyperbolic and saying every property

1639
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,960
had like 99 trees on it

1640
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,118
yeah yeah i bet so people were pulling

1641
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,199
down like you know 500 pounds on a

1642
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,400
property there was a lot of weed coming

1643
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:29,519
out of there

1644
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,039
and yeah

1645
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,318
i don't know how much time you spent up

1646
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,000
there but they've got this incredible

1647
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,480
radio station called

1648
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,480
kmud

1649
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,280

1652
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,559
call it redwood radio so it's like

1653

laytonville and

1654
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,559

during harvest listening to kmud

1670
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:24,078

1671
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,480
gorilla it was like grower radio it was

1672
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,960
community radio it was it was community

1673
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,039
radio so it was paid for by the growers

1674
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,079
so they were doing their

1675
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,838

pirate radio signal being broadcast out

1700
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,358

1705
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,759
helicopters are flying in this valley

1706
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,079
today

1707
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,079
you know like it was they were they were

1708
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,519
they were the eyes in the sky that's

1709
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,000
legitimate

1710
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,559
it was [ __ ] cool man it was it was

1711
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,280
like and when i realized that i was like

1712
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,440
duke mendo is [ __ ]

1713
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,280
on a whole nother level of organization

1714
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,159
and culture and that's the thing that

1715
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,880
like

1716
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,078
can't get lost in the in the transition

1717
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,680
is that like

1718
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,519
these people cut out a [ __ ] way of

1719
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,118
life up there

1720
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:01,199
yeah you know like

1721
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:03,358
the growers all banded together and

1722
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,798
built a school on the mountain because

1723
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,358
they didn't want their kids going down

1724
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:08,960
to the valley and like saying oh yeah my

1725
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,838
daddy grows trees for a living or

1726
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,519
whatever exactly i think that's so funky

1727
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:16,880
dude your children well isn't that the

1728
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,119
same

1729
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,798
exactly right

1730
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,680
and they just you know awesome i mean

1731
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:25,838
every year you know they would like all

1732
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,719
the growers would save some of their

1733
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:30,159
trunks or their branches and they'd be

1734
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,239
given to the school and the school would

1735
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,598
learn how to make paper from it

1736
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,759
oh wow

1737
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,519
you know that's wild well it's just like

1738
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,520
just like they do in gilroy with the

1739
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,599
with garlic town right like

1740
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,838
yeah yeah it's like you know the whole

1741
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,920
culture is around garlic but

1742
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,519
it you know it makes it's it's totally

1743
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,240
normal and that was the thing that that

1744
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:52,880
was so impressive to me that it was like

1745
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,318
[ __ ] this is so normalized

1746
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,039
and

1747
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:59,279
even an illegal market

1748
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,719
or an illegal district or whatever the

1749
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,920
federal you know the district of the

1750
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,679
state it's going to be

1751
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,039
face it all that weeds going back to

1752
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,960
back east

1753
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:10,079
right like sure some of it gets sold in

1754
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,720
dispensaries but most of it can't now

1755
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,880
yeah right so money's not there it's all

1756
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,598
interstate or black market [ __ ]

1757
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,400
and still it's a [ __ ] huge culture

1758
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,318
right like it's it's persistent

1759
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,000
right you don't get that kind of that

1760
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:27,199
doesn't develop in a year like those are

1761
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,480
like systems that develop over decades

1762
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,480
right so i don't know to me mendo and

1763
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,519
humboldt the trinity like that whole

1764
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,358
zone

1765
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,358
is pretty special

1766
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,719
yeah you know

1767
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,480
um

1768
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:42,639
so yeah i got a lot of i got a lot of

1769
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,240
love for those folks on on spy rock

1770
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,358
because they're just so [ __ ] balls

1771
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:46,159
out

1772
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,039
yeah

1773
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:51,199
i think gene gene gene is a a spy rock

1774
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:54,239
boy if i remember

1775
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:56,239
yeah yeah it's beautiful up there man

1776
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,399
it's really beautiful

1777
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,159
remember the top there's this like rock

1778
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,760
outcropping where there's like there's

1779
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,159
these weird patterns that are cut into

1780
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,400
the rock and they think it's like

1781
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:07,759
it was like a native map that they had

1782
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,039
put up on the top of this mountain so

1783
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,640
like you could like

1784
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,240
you know you could stand overlooking

1785
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,719
this valley and you could essentially

1786
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,639
see the different watersheds in which

1787
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:17,838
tribes were living in which watershed

1788
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,038
right

1789
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:21,119
that's awesome

1790
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,039
isn't that why it was called spy rock

1791
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,640
like for the kid to the kids lookout

1792
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,359
area spy rock

1793
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:27,358
looking out for the cops

1794
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,038
at the top of the mountain there's a big

1795
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:34,159
like it looks kind of like a mohawk

1796
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,280
stepping up out of the top of the

1797
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,118
mountain

1798
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,400
so i think that that was the spy rock

1799
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,160
you know

1800
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,599
but i don't know where the origin was

1801
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,759
but yeah it's like people have been

1802
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,240
living there for thousands of years

1803
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,240
yeah it's like we think it like in

1804
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:49,838
european terms and pot cars but it's

1805
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,959
like there is people that were living up

1806
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:52,480
there for

1807
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,318
you know eons

1808
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,079
yeah it's cool man

1809
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:57,358
so

1810
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,200
yeah is there anything you could speak

1811
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,880
on in the tom hill range or that you

1812
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,798
want to talk about there or any of the

1813
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,559
work you saw

1814
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,798
yeah

1815
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,000
tom's a funny guy like

1816
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,639
he's

1817
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,400
he's pretty brazen on the forums but

1818
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:17,679
he's i don't really find him like that

1819
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,880
yeah in in real life until he gets like

1820
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,159
you know a few beers in him and then

1821
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,880
he's like right up in your face

1822
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:26,960
yeah he's a strongly opinionated

1823
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,400
opinionated person

1824
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,400
um

1825
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,400
first time i met him he [ __ ] lit me

1826
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,358
up about writing something about single

1827
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,119
seed descent in that jorge book like

1828
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,119
years and years and years ago and i was

1829
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:42,000
like yeah i don't think that that's what

1830
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,000
i wrote but

1831
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,119
he's like

1832
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,039
he really gets into the minutia on the

1833
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,039
breeding stuff but he doesn't have a lot

1834
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,480
of space to be doing that

1835
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,359
you know he's someone that i would love

1836
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,199
to see

1837
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:55,838
get a field

1838
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,118
right oh yeah and put a leash on him so

1839
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:58,558
that he couldn't or one of those shot

1840
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,960
callers so that he couldn't leave the

1841
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,960
property

1842
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,358
and get in trouble yeah

1843
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:07,358
as long as he's got his little puppy

1844
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:10,960
totally dead

1845
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:13,838
focused on the [ __ ] grow you know

1846
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,838
shiny objects

1847
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,240
he could be doing some interesting stuff

1848
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,239
i feel like he's like wasting his

1849
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,679
talents up there but

1850
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,919
yeah i got nothing but love for him he's

1851
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:26,399
a good guy

1852
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,318
now how about some of your um

1853
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,079
uh watson stories as far as breeding

1854
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:31,519
goes

1855
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,640
is there anything you can talk about

1856
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,599
with that

1857
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:37,440
there's so many i mean

1858
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,519
listen the truth you know how it is with

1859
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,358
david he's such a private individual

1860
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:42,159
yeah yeah for sure that

1861
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:44,078
like

1862
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,558
i really want him to tell those stories

1863
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,480
because that's how i learned them right

1864
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,359
to a degree too begging to have him tell

1865
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,358
him

1866
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,119
oh i know i know and he it's like it's

1867
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:54,880
going to be a thing it's going to be a

1868
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,599
challenge to get it done but it's

1869
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,559
important because like i don't you know

1870
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,000
if if it did come that dave were to pass

1871
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,920
then i would start sharing some of these

1872
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,159
stories yeah you know

1873
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,280
because there's knowledge there

1874
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:09,038
so much

1875
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,480
that he that just things that he taught

1876
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,960
me about like

1877
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,358
collecting pollen or like yeah you know

1878
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,358
he did like these epic epic people like

1879
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:19,679
i'll tell you some interesting stories

1880
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:23,440
one day but like

1881
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:25,358
dave found a way

1882
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,280
years and years and years ago

1883
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:29,279
to work within the system

1884
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,519
with the within the existing

1885
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,680
hemp world but get work done like get

1886
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,920
work on drug cannabis

1887
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:43,038
whether it was like producing tons of

1888
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,280
seed or like you know like he really

1889
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,000
figured out

1890
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,119
ways to operate in both sides

1891
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,880
legally yeah is like he was compliant

1892
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,798
right yes he was following the terms of

1893
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,640
his license or whatever it was doing and

1894
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,719
and

1895
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:59,838
and so you know like everybody you know

1896
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,118
everybody kind of knows about dave's

1897
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,960
seed collection well there's there's

1898
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,559
also a pollen collection

1899
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,920
right there's a pollen collection that's

1900
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:10,000
bigger than most people's seed

1901
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,000
collection like it's [ __ ] huge

1902
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,038
and

1903
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,280
you know i just when you start thinking

1904
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,280
about

1905
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,599
like for example dude every time you

1906
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,920
throw a pollen are you collecting pollen

1907
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,838
no why not

1908
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,280
i i've always had a hard time storing it

1909
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:27,038
and then when i go back to use it it's

1910
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,240
just not viable and i waste a whole

1911
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,240
round on it

1912
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,479
yeah so he's like he's figured that all

1913
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,078
out so yeah

1914
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,000
he's got like jars of poem like you can

1915
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,640
walk into a room crack a jar out of the

1916
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,480
freezer and toss it in front of a fan

1917
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,719
and then you know we're talking like 15

1918
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,960
20 year old pollen and that's getting

1919
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,078
full full seat set so

1920
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,920
you know that's one of the things i'm

1921
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,760
going to be doing as i as i move forward

1922
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,838
on the next round of really really

1923
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,640
serious breeding is setting up

1924
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:54,000
like

1925
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,920
pollen collections so that every time

1926
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,239
you're dropping pollen you you have

1927
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,838
satchels of that pollen

1928
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:01,279
right little coke bundles or whatever

1929
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:02,159
that you can go back to because it's

1930
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,480
just

1931
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:05,519
it's such a little amount of work to do

1932
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,559
that

1933
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:08,000
versus

1934
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,240
having to go through the process of

1935
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,920
initiate a plant and get more pollen

1936
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,479
from that genotype again

1937
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,079
right it's like you may as well do it

1938
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,880
so i was saying that on one of our

1939
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,559
little

1940
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,318
future cannabis podcasts the other day

1941
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,559
but it's like you know i'm all about

1942
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:22,558
like

1943
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,720
you know and

1944
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,720
um

1945
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,838
dude from rebel groan

1946
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,558
i'm forgetting his real name right now

1947
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:36,719
yeah okay jay but rebel groan i think

1948
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,240
his name is jay but he's like you know

1949
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,358
he was talking about like for example

1950
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:41,519
when you're

1951
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:43,759
you know you got you got a parent

1952
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,038
or say you're making an s one right so

1953
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,559
you've made a cross and then you do a

1954
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,559
selection and

1955
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,559
you see you you've now you've got your

1956
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,240
your f1 c that you're growing through

1957
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,039
the cross that you made if you find a

1958
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:58,159
plant that you're you want to sell

1959
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:00,480
in that generation like you may as well

1960
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:03,358
self that plant but also pollinate it to

1961
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,639
both of the parental

1962
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,838
generation

1963
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:07,838
at the same time because you got the

1964
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:09,440
pollen flying anyway right all you're

1965
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,199
doing is sticking a clone in there to

1966
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,880
collect even if you get 100 seeds or a

1967
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:14,480
couple hundred seeds i mean that's

1968
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,400
enough for like a breeding project it's

1969
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,238
not a commercial at least but it's like

1970
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,759
you know you've got that in the bank or

1971
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,798
in the vault

1972
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,719
yeah

1973
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,238
um

1974
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,000
yeah so just little things like that you

1975
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,318
know what i mean i'm going to try to try

1976
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,319
to be useful

1977
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,198
well that's like listen all that most of

1978
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,198
this stuff came from dave

1979
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,318
right not necessarily the selfing things

1980
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,759
but like

1981
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,520
just opening my eyes up to like

1982
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:43,198
different ways of doing it not getting

1983
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,040
kind of stuck in the same thought

1984
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:47,439
process that we all get

1985
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:50,238
stuck in through passing in for around

1986
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:52,000
on forums or instagram you know exactly

1987
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,358
yeah we get stuck in a rut so that's why

1988
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,520
it's so cool when you get all these new

1989
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,239
people coming on you know

1990
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,400
into the community from outside

1991
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,479
you know like the sin change sink cinch

1992
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,358
angel guy i don't know you seen him max

1993
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,879
yeah yeah

1994
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,000
he's posting some really great

1995
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,079
information online right yeah and it's

1996
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,560
like that's the real beauty of

1997
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:15,920
legalization is that

1998
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,839
we now are not like dirty untouchables

1999
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,719
yeah we get to associate with all the

2000
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,519
rest of the people in society right yes

2001
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:26,319
and and learn and benefit from them

2002
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,319
right so i don't know i'm ranting

2003
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,159
no no but that's

2004
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,640
that pollen text that's something that's

2005
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:33,639
getting yet

2006
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,798
so many crops

2007
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:45,039
trying to use stored pollen and i mean i

2008
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,399
go through the method of using a pollen

2009
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,640
screen you know to make sure all the

2010
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:51,119
male parts are out let it dry

2011
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,119
put it inside of a airtight container

2012
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:56,559
that's dark you know in the fridge or

2013
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:57,760
freezer and it just [ __ ] never works

2014
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,920
yeah well if

2015
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,920
drying it properly is a big big thing

2016
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:05,599
drying it properly is a big thing and

2017
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:07,359
then making sure that it's frozen and

2018
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,600
stays frozen like he's got a dedicated

2019
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,119
freezer right

2020
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,360
that makes sense listen some of these

2021
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,399
things like they become like possible

2022
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,319
when you have

2023
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:19,198
scale like you can't really do some of

2024
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,880
this [ __ ] on on like bedroom scale you

2025
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,559
can play around yeah for sure but it's

2026
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,679
like it's really hard to really do it

2027
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,440
you know

2028
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,279
but that's like the reason for sharing

2029
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:29,519
that is that i want you to take it like

2030
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,279
i want everybody to take that stuff and

2031
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:34,800
you know those are the those are the

2032
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:36,479
things that dave has taught me

2033
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,880
that i would love for him to share with

2034
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:40,238
the rest of the community it's just

2035
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,960
you know i think part of the reason is

2036
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:42,399
that

2037
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,279
we have all these people that have just

2038
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,639
trashed him online for years and years

2039
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:48,158
because you know partly because they

2040
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,560
were jealous i mean like you know kim

2041
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,759
was talking about aryan before but like

2042
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,120
one of the reasons people don't like

2043
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,320
harley and it's because he's successful

2044
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:55,760
and he's [ __ ] really good at what he

2045
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,279
does and he makes a lot of money yeah

2046
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,960
people are jealous

2047
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,079
right people are jealous like that's the

2048
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,719
truth

2049
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,479
um and the same thing happened with dave

2050
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,520
he got the licenses to work in holland

2051
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,799
when when the dutch dudes that lived

2052
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,400
couldn't figure out how to get the

2053
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:15,279
licenses yeah and he figured out which

2054
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:16,799
you know which path to take to get the

2055
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,039
trophy

2056
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,800
you know and they hated him for it and

2057
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,319
and so that's where all the stories

2058
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,000
started coming from was it but it was

2059
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:26,158
based in chelsea and i tell you dude

2060
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,520
like after noah and david and learning

2061
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,439
for from him

2062
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,239
for so long

2063
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:34,000
he's the real [ __ ] deal you know

2064
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:36,158
and anybody that says

2065
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,079
otherwise they just don't know it's like

2066
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,599
when people i see people start barking

2067
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:41,519
[ __ ] about like

2068
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,600
watson being a [ __ ] d agent or

2069
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,600
whatever it is it's like i'm just like

2070
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,520
oh well this guy just doesn't know right

2071
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,039
he's like he's self identity he's

2072
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,040
identifying himself as someone that

2073
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:52,960
doesn't get it because

2074
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:57,840
like dave's a real deal like and he's

2075
01:11:52,960 --> 01:12:00,158
done yeah that should that's been fast

2076
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,079
that stuff's been passed around for so

2077
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:03,439
long i was involved in it i mean i

2078
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,840
thought he was a dea agent because of

2079
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:08,799
what neville told me directly you know

2080
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,880
and i think it and it takes a long time

2081
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,520
for stuff like that to die out but with

2082
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,039
him not interacting much and not i mean

2083
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,040
he shouldn't have to defend himself if

2084
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,560
it's not true right but with him not

2085
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,039
there's not a lot of input from it so

2086
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,960
people just run with it and it's it's it

2087
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:26,158
becomes lower yeah and you know how

2088
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,158
these things are it's like

2089
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,320
you know you have a negative something

2090
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,760
happens in your life and it's like you

2091
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,519
got to deal with it like some other

2092
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,360
people talking about it all the time and

2093
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,800
you deal with it and it goes away but

2094
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:38,479
it's like some of those things it's like

2095
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,000
they just never go away like people just

2096
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,919
keep bringing it up no matter what yeah

2097
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,719
and like

2098
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,199
when when truthfully like i will say

2099
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,719
this like believing in 100

2100
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,479
there is nobody live on the [ __ ]

2101
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,399
planet that has done more for cannabis

2102
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:53,919
than david watson like that is the

2103
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:55,119
[ __ ] i would agree

2104
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,079
i would agree

2105
01:12:55,119 --> 01:13:00,158
without a doubt um

2106
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,359
including like you know founding and

2107
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:04,799
funding the international hemp

2108
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:06,960
association right like he created a hub

2109
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,039
in that process and brought

2110
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,158
all the individual researchers in the

2111
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,319
world

2112
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:13,679
gave them all a central hub place to

2113
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:16,238
call home

2114
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,079
and that created a sense of community

2115
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,559
for the cannabis

2116
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,238
like the whole industry like the global

2117
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,159
cannabis industry

2118
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:26,559
at a time when

2119
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:28,799
the dea were [ __ ] knocking countries

2120
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,679
off left right and center

2121
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,840
right

2122
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:35,039
so

2123
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,640
you know i i would love to have david

2124
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,640
answer all these questions and just ha

2125
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,640
just sit there and be like i wouldn't

2126
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,640
even want to be i just want to draw the

2127
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,159
information out of them right because i

2128
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,920
know a lot of the stories now so it's

2129
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,639
like i know what questions to ask to get

2130
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,560
him to talk but he's done some like just

2131
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,679
absolutely incredible things with

2132
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,159
cannabis

2133
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,279
and if he doesn't share those stories

2134
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,198
um

2135
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:58,319
while he's around there has to be a

2136
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,479
movie made

2137
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:01,840
to document it for history because it's

2138
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:04,879
like

2139
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,079
the level of epicness is like

2140
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,800
right

2141
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:12,800
like just what i know for a fact is it

2142
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:15,520
would be a crazy [ __ ] movie all of it

2143
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,400
yeah yeah he's managing those shadows

2144
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,800
one dinner's worth of conversation could

2145
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:25,119
easily do a movie right like dinner with

2146
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:27,920
andre but dinner with dave easy peasy

2147
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,880
you can get lost down so many roads of

2148
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,840
his

2149
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,880
incredible intellect and adventure

2150
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:37,440
yeah

2151
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,440
and balls to do what he did like

2152
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,520
just because he didn't like just because

2153
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,279
he didn't give a [ __ ] you know i mean he

2154
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,719
like he firmly believed that it was the

2155
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,880
right like he told me a story about

2156
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,239
being in morocco and getting like

2157
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,600
sickness and you know and rocker then

2158
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:51,439
off toilets it's just like a hole on the

2159
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,159
floor kind of thing right yeah and so

2160
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,238
he's like having some virus or some

2161
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:58,399
bacteria just like go through his system

2162
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,879
and decimate him and he started smoking

2163
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,479
hash on the while he was over the hole

2164
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,640
so to speak

2165
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:06,559
and it immediately realized that

2166
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,880
cannabis had medicinal value it was like

2167
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,600
it can work for him

2168
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,039
right and this is back before

2169
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,840
anybody

2170
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:15,920
had

2171
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,840
really considered like that cannabis was

2172
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,800
medicinal like we're talking about 60s

2173
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,960
here

2174
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,840
yeah um

2175
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,679
and just made it his life's work to like

2176
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,840
take that as far as he could and you

2177
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,440
know you know the horn farm stories and

2178
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,520
the gw and all the stuff that people

2179
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,119
have said if you can just distill that

2180
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,600
down to like the few

2181
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,599
truths that exist in there dave had the

2182
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,560
[ __ ] first medical marijuana company

2183
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,800
in the world

2184
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,800
yeah he did right like there was no one

2185
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,719
else doing it back then and i think

2186
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,520
that's where a lot of the suspicion came

2187
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,198
from

2188
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,440
you know that he was just he pulled it

2189
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:51,759
off how do you do it yeah

2190
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,519
and jealousy right too like

2191
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,880
exactly that he figured out whatever

2192
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,120
nobody else could

2193
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,960
and you know

2194
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,000
he you know yeah i don't know i got

2195
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,359
nothing but good things to say about

2196
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,960
david i mean in many ways he's kind of a

2197
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,039
father figure to me

2198
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,880
um

2199
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,560
you know kipp and and these dudes had

2200
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,560

01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,400
richardson they knew him before and dave

2202
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,159
and i used to just speak online but when

2203
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,319
when i met him

2204
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,599
he was really rude to me like the first

2205
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:20,960
time i met him

2206
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,960
like you said hey i heard that one

2207
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:27,339
that's generally how david meets people

2208
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:28,559
by the way

2209
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,319
[Laughter]

2210
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,920
i'm sure he has a punch for me but

2211
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,479
that's okay

2212
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:38,079
i'd take a punch to meet him

2213
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:40,639

2214

um of dave of david's and it's

2215
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,039
essentially like if you have

2216
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,400
the five star the six star hash or like

2217
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:47,840

2218
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,198
you know little jar of rosin or

2219
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,800
something like that like something

2220
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:51,759

2221
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,360
and

2222
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,199

01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,000
about it

2225
01:16:56,238 --> 01:17:00,000
that it's like if you have if you have

2226
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,600
the goods then he has to give you

2227
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,198
respect because

2228
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,960
you don't just end up with a jar like

2229
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:08,079
this you know what i feel like yeah of a

2230
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,560
truly top top top top top shelf stuff

2231
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:13,119
right like you have to be an artist or

2232
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,960
have at least have an appreciation for

2233
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,279
making and finding the best

2234
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,520
and if you have that then you're dave's

2235
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:23,840
kindred soulmate right because that's

2236
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,840
his only goal in life

2237
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,320
i have a little tag on to that when i

2238
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:33,519
first met dave he was walking through

2239
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:35,599
our facility over in europe and uh a

2240
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,520
very intimidating figure he's a big guy

2241
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,039
big taxes yeah

2242
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,080
and

2243
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:41,920
so

2244
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:43,760
you know as you go through the facility

2245
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,119
he just kept taking his wooden matches

2246
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,280
and laying them and hitting this bubble

2247
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,039
that he had on this tiny little pipe and

2248
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:50,319
then they dropped the match

2249
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,640
you literally

2250
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,559
like a trunk your trail can follow where

2251
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,000
dave had been through all the best

2252
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,159
methods on the channel throughout the

2253
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,238
facility like through doors around

2254
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:02,479
corners come back around

2255
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:05,839
it was like some kind of you know

2256
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:07,839
denny's treasure map for kids

2257
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,239
so is he a big hashtag as opposed to a

2258
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,199
flower smoker is he more into hash or

2259
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:15,359
i've never seen him smoke flowers never

2260
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,759
wild that's pretty cool that's a good

2261
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:20,559
little insight into his brain

2262
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,480
yeah he's a pure resin farmer

2263
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,080
he is this thing that he says i'll tell

2264
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:25,759
you one story

2265
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,600
he tells me that he's i've heard him say

2266
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,000
a few times when he was in afghanistan

2267
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,880
we're talking like late 60s he and his

2268
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,560
wife

2269
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,880
were sitting around with a bunch of the

2270
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,960
old men the baba's in the village and

2271
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,960
they were smoking uh

2272
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,119
bubbly bubbly's of the the finest hash

2273
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,960
they had and david was over there

2274
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:44,399
collecting seeds right like he was

2275
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,000
trying to find stuff to bring back and

2276
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,799
so he asked this old afghan stand dude

2277
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,760
for

2278
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,679
um

2279
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,280
some cannabis so that he could get nuts

2280
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,719
he didn't say so i can get the seeds but

2281
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:57,039
he's like yeah yeah do you have the

2282
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,439
flowers and he said

2283
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,039
like like every everybody stopped

2284
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,119
talking and it was just like dead

2285
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:04,399
silence and one of the man said he said

2286
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,238
the man looked at him like he was a

2287
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:08,879
piece of [ __ ]

2288
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:12,319
and he and he said

2289
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:15,119
hashish is for men

2290
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:18,000
cannabis flower is for women and slaves

2291
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,000
oh [ __ ]

2292
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,599
oh [ __ ]

2293
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,520

2294
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,880
you know yeah yeah old school like

2295
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,840

2297
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,600

seeds and take it back to california and

2300
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:36,719
grow plants to make my own hash and that

2301
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,158
was like that was that was acceptable

2302
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,079
that's funny

2303
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,479
so dave was

2304
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,000
i would love to know if you if you know

2305
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:45,198
when was the first time he was

2306
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,119
encountering

2307
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,439
afghanis was he one of the first people

2308
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:50,960
importing the seeds of afghanis to the

2309
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:52,399
u.s

2310
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,399
in the late 60s

2311
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:55,839
i'm not sure i mean he did

2312
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,319
he's always kind of gone through

2313
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,600
afghanis i mean even when they were in

2314
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,960
um

2315
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,719
at horror farm like he was always

2316
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,158
screening [ __ ] loads of any seats

2317
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,920
because people are always coming back

2318
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:08,000
from there with different lots

2319
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,079
but he said generally it was [ __ ] like

2320
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,760
it was not what you wanted

2321
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,158
you gotta remember they got pretty spot

2322
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,000
or spoiled early on with like you know

2323
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:19,039
neighbors with the haze brothers right

2324
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,719
so he had like

2325
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:23,119
i think it's hard for people of our age

2326
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,399
to understand that there was a time

2327
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,158
that was pre

2328
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,158
like afghanistan

2329
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:31,119
right exactly yeah most people our age

2330
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:31,759
don't know that it came in the you know

2331
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,479
exactly late 70s

2332
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:37,199
it gains popularity and and so when it

2333
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:39,759
did come i mean rob i think it was rob

2334
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,439
wrote um an article on it

2335
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,079
for high times but it was that you know

2336
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:45,039
they high times had like a ban the bud

2337
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,439
issue

2338
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:50,000
it was like we need to ban indica

2339
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,678
because it's like [ __ ] up our [ __ ]

2340
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,439
right there's like a movement in the

2341
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,760
community that was like that's why i

2342
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:57,678
stopped cross indica and everything

2343
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,039
because it's ruining our nice highs from

2344
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,039
the colombians and the mexicans

2345
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,560
yeah like now with cookies i mean people

2346
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,319
want to ban cookies from from genetics

2347
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,679
because everything's cookies everything

2348
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:15,840
yeah

2349
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:18,800
yeah yeah yeah i'll be the first person

2350
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,000
to sign up to that petition

2351
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,760
yeah i'm part of the problem though

2352
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,719
because i use it too so what the [ __ ] do

2353
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,960
i know

2354
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,000
you know it's opium for the masses right

2355
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,639
yeah

2356
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
well this this is super gas too so i'm

2357
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,600
like you know

2358
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,079
i'm also

2359
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,079
guilty but i i really do

2360
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,519
try to push the the different terpene

2361
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:39,039
profiles because there's just some stuff

2362
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,719
i mean yeah we came across this one

2363
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:43,198
thing that was like a piney like it had

2364
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:45,840
almost no other terps but it was like a

2365
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,279
lot of pioneer and a lot of limonene and

2366
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,000
dude this [ __ ] was

2367
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:53,840
zippy zippy zippy it was like

2368
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,520
smear and focused and just high energy

2369
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,440
um you're not talking about you're not

2370
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,239
talking about last summer

2371
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:02,000
no no no when i first came up the pr i

2372
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:03,359
had a bag of it

2373
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,679
um i don't know if you tried anything

2374
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,559
where i was calling it the lyman pine

2375
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:09,039
um

2376
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,639
yes okay yeah okay but again it's in

2377
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:12,800
that it's just in that very like

2378
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,639
equatorial family side of things didn't

2379
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,199
yield were [ __ ] you know what i mean

2380
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:19,600
like it was a terrible plant to grow

2381
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:22,238
but it was it had a lovely effect and

2382
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,039
the rosin from it was like

2383
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:24,879
you know

2384
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:27,039
took some down to marcus and we pressed

2385
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,880
up or a couple ounces of it it was fire

2386
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:31,279
as [ __ ]

2387
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,600
but um you know you'd want to be growing

2388
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:36,399
that stuff in large cheap greenhouses

2389
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,760
outside oh i'm sure because indoors it

2390
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:38,960
just didn't make sense for the real

2391
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,480
estate you know

2392
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,079
yeah

2393
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:44,079
those things are big and burly and not a

2394
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,920
lot of yield on some of them

2395
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:48,319
yeah and somebody was asking about the

2396
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,239
guerrero line on the oh yeah let's talk

2397
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:51,519
about that blueberry that was one of

2398
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:52,959
those plants so i've been playing with

2399
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,480
those seeds for a little bit somebody

2400
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,079
sent us a bunch of

2401
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:59,359
old stuff um legends used to actually

2402
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:00,800
would people would be like oh i have

2403
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:04,000
these seeds i want you to get in your

2404
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,560
hands i just say send them legends

2405
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,560
because they're like

2406
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:12,879
and anyway we found these these this old

2407
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:13,679
mexican screen through a bunch of them

2408
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,319
and

2409
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,199
they were gangly and like just unruly as

2410
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:18,880
hell

2411
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,879
and when we were making the seeds for

2412
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,960
the blueberry stuff i just thought i was

2413
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,119
like let's get one of those in there

2414
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,639
yeah and you know i think one plant must

2415
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,639
have yielded like it was you know it

2416
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,639
grew huge

2417
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,159
and it was probably in the like five to

2418
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,960
ten thousand seeds

2419
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,799
from that one plant um

2420
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,920
but the the way that they came together

2421
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,440
with the blueberry i mean you know the

2422
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,719
blueberry kind of has that phenotype

2423
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,359
there's the two phenotypes there's like

2424
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:45,520
the kind of more compact round

2425
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:48,079
classic mud but it also does like those

2426
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,800
kind of knuckley buds or yeah like kind

2427
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:52,880
of like little fox tails yeah yeah when

2428
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,239
that got into the mexican

2429
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:58,079
that made some crazy expressions

2430
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:01,039
right like the just the flowers that

2431
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:03,840
were like long sets and bracks are like

2432
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:05,600
yellow on fox tape i remember what the

2433
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,159
i remember what the cross looked like in

2434
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,840
pictures yeah real remind me of

2435
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:12,638
the picture of lamb's bread and jason

2436
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,079
king's can of bible

2437
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,639
real long

2438
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,639
super long knuckles

2439
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:21,519
so that's you know that's still a fun

2440
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,199
one i i really want to dig into that

2441
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,719
line but it kind of like

2442
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:26,559
i'm kind of hoping that someone on like

2443
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,760
in the caribbean says hey come and plant

2444
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,440
like you know

2445
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,600
five acres down here for selections

2446
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:34,799
because that's where you'd want to do it

2447
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:37,920
it's just it's too it's too hard to do

2448
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,400
indoors right and in canada unless you

2449
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,760
are tarpon that stuff

2450
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,399
you're not going to get that ever to

2451
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,000
flat like to finish flowering so yeah

2452
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:47,198
um

2453
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,039
yeah these are the fun things that

2454
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:50,559
happen with like legalization happening

2455
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:51,519
all over the world is we can legally

2456
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,600
move

2457
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,920
germplasm to these new districts and set

2458
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,520
up a [ __ ] screening station right

2459
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,119
yeah

2460
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,199
yeah i have a bunch of stuff that i

2461
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,559
would love to run but and that people

2462
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:04,319
have asked me if i'm going to work but

2463
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,400
the realistic part of it is i'm never

2464
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:08,079
going to see the ultimate expression of

2465
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:10,000
it unless it's run in a proper place to

2466
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,399
even see what you can select

2467
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
well i'm really hoping that this latest

2468
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,759
project that i'm working on is going to

2469
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,359
afford you know it's

2470
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,679
we're going to get some space to to do

2471
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,679
some cool stuff some cool work

2472
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,440
and like i was saying to keep earning

2473
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,279
tonight like i don't want to make it

2474
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:26,960
about the ryan show

2475
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:28,479
you know if we've got a chance to like

2476
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,639
really explore

2477
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:32,479
dude all of my friends that have

2478
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,400
interesting seeds you know are going to

2479
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:36,399
be welcome to come and

2480
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:37,759
you know be part of that however that

2481
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:38,839
looks like

2482
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,520
is it going to be

2483
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,840
canada it's international but there's

2484
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,400
gonna be a location in canada yeah

2485
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:49,679
very excellent yeah so the idea is to

2486
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:51,279
kind of have nursery services to to the

2487
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,800
new districts that are opening up all

2488
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,519
over the world

2489
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:58,239
right that's awesome and so the idea is

2490
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,239
to find a like a royalty model that is

2491
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:01,919
that works for breeders

2492
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,759
so that they want to be part of it and

2493
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,840
they can opt into whatever degree of

2494
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:09,199
participation they want to or not

2495
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,960
um and then we'll essentially offer

2496
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:12,719
nursery services so that

2497
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,920
it'll help people get into these markets

2498
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,960
globally

2499
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,440
right because it was one of the things

2500
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,760
that was really [ __ ] up about it

2501
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:22,559
it's been it's been a real problem as

2502
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,920
the industry grows is that there was no

2503
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,719
central place that had a bunch of

2504
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,960
different good varieties that you could

2505
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:31,119
work with you know i mean

2506
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,800
there's hundreds of excellent cultivars

2507
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,800
like across the globe

2508
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,159
right but essentially like people are

2509
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,039
like trying to start these like

2510
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:40,638
multi-billion dollar companies with like

2511
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:41,840
three seeds they bought off the internet

2512
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:44,319
from cap

2513
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:47,360
you know what i mean it's crazy crazy in

2514
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:49,119
a way yeah one of these massive massive

2515
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,359
big like pub clubs where we're talking

2516
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:53,840
like the top three players

2517
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:55,519
when they started their bank their bank

2518
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,279
they did the same thing that all the

2519
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,520
beginners do is they went and got like

2520
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:02,158
100 different types of

2521
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:05,520
named varieties but they got a three

2522
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:07,039
pack of each yeah right and it's like

2523
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,120
dude you'd be better off getting three

2524
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:10,479
packs and a hundred of each

2525
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:11,840
yeah right

2526
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:14,479
right because then you can actually do a

2527
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,360
real selection but yeah again it's like

2528
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,399
that total lack of understanding of

2529
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:20,559
cannabis

2530
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:23,359
to the point of like you think that you

2531
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,560
can grow three things with a name on it

2532
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:27,599
and they're all going to come up looking

2533
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:31,560
the same like that's [ __ ] delusional

2534
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,560
yeah that's highly delusional

2535
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:36,479
but at the same time it's like everyone

2536
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:37,920
runs to one side of the boat then

2537
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:39,198
everyone runs the other side of the boat

2538
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,359
then they go to the back side and they

2539
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:43,839
go to the front side i mean it's it's

2540
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:45,359
cookies it's wedding cake it's gelato

2541
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,119
it's mac one it's i mean it just you

2542
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:48,158
just keep

2543
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:49,920
you know

2544
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:51,439
the problem is keeping it in vogue i

2545
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,800
mean you've got to make an iconic

2546
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:55,439
cultivar

2547
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,360
to get maybe two year run out of it at

2548
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:59,599
this at the world the market is right

2549
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:01,679
now otherwise you're 10 months you're

2550
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,079
out yeah and then that's just the

2551
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:06,239
reality of unfortunately what it is so

2552
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:09,198
how so how does that play with what you

2553
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:11,359
know ryan's talking about and genetics

2554
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:12,799
and and how do because nurse would spend

2555
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:14,719
all this time the breeders spend all

2556
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,840
this time perfecting these beautiful

2557
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:20,800
cultivars for specific morphological uh

2558
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,880
grows in specific paradigms of growing

2559
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,639
and they have all this work on them they

2560
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,800
can literally tell they defeated every

2561
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,960
bloody day like it's a plug-and-play

2562
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,960
like

2563
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,960
yeah

2564
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,000
then all for it to be out of favor in 10

2565
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,079
months

2566
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,920
yeah me and um csi were talking about

2567
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:40,158
this the other day and

2568
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,279
uh we're both believers in testing like

2569
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:42,638
running your own [ __ ] so you know what

2570
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,158
your own [ __ ] is so you can see it in

2571
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,679
front of your face so you know how that

2572
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:47,599
mail breeds etc

2573
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:49,199
but at the rate the market's going it's

2574
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,480
it's almost getting to the point where

2575
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:52,479
testing will

2576
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:54,559
flush yourself out of the market

2577
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:56,718
as hot as that sounds

2578
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,719
like

2579
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,639
what i've found effective

2580
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:07,359
in the industry in the short and short

2581
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:09,440
snapshot we've seen is guys who will you

2582
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:11,439
know sorry companies that roll

2583
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,599
four of ours

2584
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:15,919
roll them just roll them and so like you

2585
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,679
could get like three or four you might

2586
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,960
pull a year off a single bar but you're

2587
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:22,560
rolling four so it buys you extra time

2588
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,119
and it keeps you relevant and it keeps

2589
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,560
you fresh and it keeps people's interest

2590
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,158
in you because

2591
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,639
like flying like they just like they

2592
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:32,479
forget like they're like nuts consumers

2593
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,319
man what's new what's hot what's new

2594
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:36,319
what's hot what's new what's hot brand

2595
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:38,639
loyalty there's no brand loyalty there's

2596
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:41,679
no cultivar loyalty there's no profile

2597
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:43,039
loyalty there's no loyalty yeah yeah

2598
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,279
that's not what it's really

2599
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:47,600
the funniest thing is saying that i mean

2600
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,800
i i agree what you're saying to a degree

2601
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,320
but like

2602
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,159
in the states we've seen this thing

2603
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:54,238
where there actually is brand loyalty or

2604
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,238
not there is cultivar loyalty

2605
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:59,198
because they can market it they can make

2606
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:01,198
it a culture we can't do that up here

2607
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:03,759
interesting that's the problem

2608
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:06,079
yeah well we're just both insane labeled

2609
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,600
[ __ ] dopes all selling the same 12

2610
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:09,519
different versions of cookie and kush

2611
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,800
you know like yay

2612
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,239
well that's that's kind of what i'm

2613
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,320
trying to get to that to like you know

2614
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,238
the comment earlier about but i'll be in

2615
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,759
booth

2616
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:19,198
to a degree it's true because all these

2617
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,239
companies that came out hot and hard at

2618
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:22,238
the beginning with all the money they

2619
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,158
were all public companies and they were

2620
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:26,000
all talk and flash and million square

2621
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,879
foot greenhouses and blah blah blah blah

2622
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,238
blah but we've seen over the last three

2623
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,760
years they're all [ __ ] suffering i

2624
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,238
mean canopy is just

2625
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:36,400
they're bleeding billions of dollars and

2626
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:38,238
their weed sucks

2627
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:39,679
and you know

2628
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:41,439
like i said like what it should have

2629
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,039
been from the start is just

2630
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,000
transitioning all the illegal growers

2631
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:45,359
over

2632
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,039
and letting them keep running their

2633
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:49,439
business rather than trying to displace

2634
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:52,000
them right but no one would have made

2635
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:53,678
any money brian

2636
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,479
they would never be legalized that way

2637
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:59,679
the only money that's in it is because

2638
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:01,198
the money they made is off of stock

2639
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,960
place like they haven't actually made

2640
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:04,479
any money selling weed

2641
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,079
which is crazy when you think about how

2642
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:08,000
many families

2643
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:09,439
and mortgages were suppo were supported

2644
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,719
and paid for

2645
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:12,960
across the united states and north

2646
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:14,560
america and canada as well like i mean

2647
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,560
that money went around not only to the

2648
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,080
growers but to their communities right

2649
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,920
like banks

2650
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:21,439
it's not like people were getting rich

2651
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,719
off of cannabis maybe people were paying

2652
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:23,599
the bills

2653
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,158
um

2654
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,520
yeah but anyway i see that the i you

2655
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:29,279
know i think we're going to be going

2656
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,560
through some growing pains here

2657
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:32,158
that you guys definitely are not going

2658
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,400
to experience down in the states because

2659
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:36,719
you don't have that federal

2660
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:38,960
like not only do they federalize the the

2661
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,960
production laws and everything

2662
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,600
but the distribution is all provincial

2663
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:47,039
like it's all run by state like boards

2664
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,400
that's right yeah right and and like kip

2665
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:49,760
was saying

2666
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:51,599
the way that you have to sell to those

2667
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,039
boards like for example

2668
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,239
you know if you go to a wine store in

2669
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:56,238
california

2670
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,678
it's like you can get pinots from 100

2671
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:59,599
different producers

2672
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,840
try finding like

2673
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,960
like a platinum cookies from or what's

2674
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,960
give me a popular one camp or a mac 10.

2675
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,960
wedding cake

2676
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,039
right it's like the ldbs the liquor

2677
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,319
distribution boards they're like no we

2678
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:14,479
already have a wedding cake we're not

2679
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:15,519
going to buy that

2680
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:17,198
yeah

2681
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,440
right because what happens is people

2682
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,439
have to rename it

2683
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:23,439
right yeah i think that that's part of

2684
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:24,559
what's changing what's creating this

2685
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:26,638
like

2686
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,120
like kip was saying it's this this

2687
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:31,279
unattainable or you were saying as well

2688
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:34,000
with caleb i mean it's this unattainable

2689
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:36,079
drive for the new new

2690
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,279
that it's like we're going so fast it's

2691
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,840
like you don't even have time to

2692
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:41,679
appreciate what you made it's like yeah

2693
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,560
he's making a new nft and selling it

2694
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:45,199
again

2695
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:47,679
yeah exactly and that's not

2696
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:49,119
the way cannabis is topical very topical

2697
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:52,480
right right

2698
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:55,519
so yeah it's it's backwards it's it it's

2699
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:57,759
very regressive for breeding period yeah

2700
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,000
well that's not it's not doable it's

2701
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,440
like it's yeah it's literally like yeah

2702
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,760
you know

2703
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:06,799
unfortunately the platform right now

2704
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:09,039
it's the instagram immediacy of needing

2705
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,880
something new right and that's how the

2706
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,639
lead the most recent generation has kind

2707
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,319
of learned about cannabis

2708
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:16,079
so i i you know we got a lot of work to

2709
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,079
do to redistribute

2710
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,319
um the knowledge and get all these old

2711
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:21,840
varieties back in

2712
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:23,920
um not only to the hands of the

2713
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,719
consumers but also teach these like

2714
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:28,800
liquor distribution boards so it's like

2715
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,719
you know you

2716
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,000
you can't come in this

2717
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,520
listen they you know what it's like

2718
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
you're running a just you're doing

2719
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,400
distribution you want to deal with five

2720
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,359
suppliers and sell to a thousand

2721
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:42,879
customers you don't deal with like 500

2722
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,279
suppliers and sell to a thousand

2723
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,679
customers i mean it's a lot more work

2724
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:49,519
right but we're seeing more and more and

2725
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:52,079
we said it since the beginning

2726
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:54,320
big popco cannabis like public market

2727
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:55,359
company cannabis that ain't the [ __ ]

2728
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:58,158
future

2729
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:00,158
right because it becomes like this like

2730
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:01,679
this dangling carrot where it's like

2731
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,839
they're it's more they're more

2732
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:04,880
interested in the stock price than the

2733
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,679
wheat

2734
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,079
yeah

2735
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,440
um and the customer doesn't give a [ __ ]

2736
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:10,800
about the stock price the customer gives

2737
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:12,479
a [ __ ] about the lead

2738
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,199
so if you're not giving the customer

2739
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,718
what they want what they want

2740
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:18,960
why would anybody buy from you and we're

2741
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,480
seeing like that play out year after

2742
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,239
year now

2743
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:25,279
where we can track their sales in the

2744
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:27,759
legal market and you see it's just like

2745
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:30,639
it's going down like nobody's buying the

2746
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,560
drinks nobody's buying the gummies

2747
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:34,159
but the reason they're doing this and

2748
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,679
it's very clear and very simple is that

2749
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:37,839
they're revenue driven they're not

2750
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:39,520
profit driven right it's because and

2751
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,840
that's what it needs to be like people

2752
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,520
need to understand that's why they sell

2753
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,920
for losses that's why they sell and

2754
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,400
undercut everybody else that's trying to

2755
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,480
make a decent living in a decent wage

2756
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:52,158
you know a family business

2757
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:53,599
because they don't give a [ __ ] they can

2758
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:54,638
run losses for

2759
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,520
exactly

2760
01:34:54,639 --> 01:35:01,719
so ray look at canopy look at aurora

2761
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,719
like they all ran long

2762
01:35:07,279 --> 01:35:11,439
their competitors out of money and then

2763
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:13,440
they operate and take over the market

2764
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,118
drive everything up and jack the price

2765
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,960
is up yeah and you know i would listen

2766
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:19,439
that was that would work that would work

2767
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,760
in a whole bunch of other crops where

2768
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:23,118
the consumer wasn't intimate with

2769
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,920
quality

2770
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:27,359
the the consumer demands quality in

2771
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,118
cannabis i mean you're not going to

2772
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,559
smoke [ __ ] schweins

2773
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:31,839
right you're not

2774
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,280
um and i'm not going to do this on the

2775
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,639
market

2776
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:35,519
because this is what i'm used to yeah

2777
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:38,719
but

2778
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:41,280
but ryan honestly though i mean like 65

2779
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,920
of all cannabis buyers buy dry cannabis

2780
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,639
here in canada okay

2781
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:49,520
and what what portion are they buying it

2782
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:51,600
in they're buying it in the cheapest

2783
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,239
possible way for the highest possible

2784
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,079
thc with no differentiation they don't

2785
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:58,479
want to spend over 25 bucks a day

2786
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:00,079
generally and they just they just want

2787
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:01,439
their cheap dope and they want to get in

2788
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:02,960
get out of the store

2789
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:04,319
i mean this is one

2790
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,840
these are what the magic they're telling

2791
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:07,359
us like monthly when we get all these

2792
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,679
numbers going to come in

2793
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:10,639
and it's just so disheartening but again

2794
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:14,079
it's because

2795
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,359
we can't um market our our products

2796
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:17,439
properly we can't talk to the

2797
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:20,079
fundraisers the biggest chasm in the

2798
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:22,399
world in the industry is producers and

2799
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,800
bug tenders i mean that's just horrific

2800
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,000
you know the lack of education

2801
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,840
you know like they're not telling

2802
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,679
stories especially making 16 bucks an

2803
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,360
hour they're not there to tell stories

2804
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,118
no they just want to like punch their

2805
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:33,920
clock and get the [ __ ] out

2806
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:35,839
so

2807
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,399
it's on us as an industry to have to be

2808
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,039
able to tell these stories and that was

2809
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,479
it you know like guerrilla warfare ways

2810
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:43,920
like back in the day like i don't know

2811
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:44,638
what to say at the point of the game

2812
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,239
it's

2813
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,520
it's it's crazy like

2814
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:49,279
i gotta tell you like you know there's

2815
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,880
tons of companies that are pressing and

2816
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,359
pushing the boundaries of what's

2817
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,880
allowable you know marketing and

2818
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:55,599
labeling and

2819
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,279
and

2820
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,960
a voice here in canada

2821
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:00,399
they're so understaffed to be quite

2822
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,920
frank like they're not they're not

2823
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:03,759
really doing anything i mean you know

2824
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,760
look at the lp that was growing illegal

2825
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,960
to open illegal rooms and they still

2826
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,920
have a license and they got busted cold

2827
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,239
so i mean

2828
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,319
you can bust me for for putting my font

2829
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:16,158
two sizes too big on a label like give

2830
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:19,719
me a break yeah

2831
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:19,719
anyways uh

2832
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,719
know i just think that i think you're

2833
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,920
right i think

2834
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,279
we have to and i've been saying this for

2835
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,118
a while we have to

2836
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:29,840
figure out a way to make people want to

2837
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:31,920
educate themselves yeah and that's so

2838
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,760
[ __ ] hard to do when it comes to weed

2839
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,359
so hard because and we're like people

2840
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,199
just want to smoke that's it and with

2841
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:39,118
pretty as a culture we're preachy we

2842
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:40,960
always want everyone to be as happy as

2843
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:43,198
we are with what we found in life to be

2844
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,198
spread

2845
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,279
and some people just

2846
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,280
don't have that relationship and we

2847
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:53,279
can't push that but yet they're still a

2848
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,479
consumer they're just not ahead

2849
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,960
right

2850
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:59,279
so and we have to there's also that and

2851
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,359
that's a large part of the growing

2852
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,880
consumer base they don't have the

2853
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:04,319
attachment we all did with the

2854
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,400
legalization

2855
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:07,920
the hidden shame the you know the

2856
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,319
meeting in the parking lots all that

2857
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,079
crap yeah you know what it is for great

2858
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:14,000
sakes you know

2859
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:16,800
they don't know what a dealer is yeah

2860
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,800
and so this is not the generation that

2861
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,199
our generation understands and it's a

2862
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,960
new consumer and new consumers want

2863
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:24,479
different flavors and they want they

2864
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,000
want the cannabis delivered to them

2865
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,158
differently they want it in different

2866
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,520
skews and they want to be able to go

2867
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:31,118
online

2868
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,800
and order it up and they don't want any

2869
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:34,639
personal interaction

2870
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,279
yeah so you've got to be able to tell a

2871
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:38,960
story digitally and and and and find a

2872
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:41,679
campaign that touches these kinds of

2873
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:43,679
consumers that aren't us because all we

2874
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:46,560
do is zelda

2875
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:49,520
and you know that yeah that's for sure

2876
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:52,159
you know so again open minds and i mean

2877
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:53,520
i turned 50 this year and man like

2878
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,118
my mind is

2879
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,280
i know less and less each day in this

2880
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:59,118
industry like if there's just so much

2881
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:01,759
populating this industry all day that

2882
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:03,759
it's so tough to keep a handle on a lot

2883
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,440
of it to be quite frank

2884
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,039
but if she it keeps you interested

2885
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,879
there's no doubt about that

2886
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:10,719
yeah that's for sure yeah i'm learning

2887
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,319
the seed industry every

2888
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,840
i always think i have it figured out and

2889
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:15,519
then something comes along to make me

2890
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,039
realize how much i don't have it figured

2891
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,360
out and i watch a lot of these young

2892
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:21,760
bucks figure it out just instantly

2893
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:23,759
around me they they're making it happen

2894
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,039
you know

2895
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:28,000
they have an app for it they have a

2896
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,000
program for it man

2897
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,840
they're more dialed into what's going on

2898
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:36,799
right and and how it operates and i just

2899
