do you know what it's an interesting one

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,600
with me uh like I being a European

34
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,938
grower like there were certain things

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,699
that obviously stood out to us you know

36
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,559
we we kind of had the Dutch seed banks

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,100
so that was kind of a lot of our

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,040
influence and the thing with me as I

39
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:35,099
became just obsessed with cannabis in my

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,680
youth so then I was starting to hunt all

41
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,019
of the different magazines to to look at

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,299
different things and it eventually led

43
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,640
me to

44
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,040
by Rob Connell Clark yeah and that was

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,640
the pivotal moment that upon read in

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,740
that book I got to the end decided one I

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,420
was given up tobacco because as a

48
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,419
European we had been taught that you

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,460
needed tobacco in joints to help you

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,460
etc etc it was just it was foreign

51
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,038
that was all you you occasionally met a

52
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:10,199
Jamaican guy and he'd smoke idols and

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,779
wouldn't smoke tobacco that was the only

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,919
knowledge we really had of that in

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,860
England so all of a sudden discover that

56
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,479
I didn't need tobacco and to learn so

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,700
much about the plant

58
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,859
from the book hashish that was what kind

59
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,039
of sparked me wanting to grow and get

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,260
into get into it myself it's so wild how

61
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,199
many people Rob Clark influenced like in

62
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,840
our sphere bro two of them to have read

63
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,639
that book and been inspired to grow and

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,539
then many years later to have hung out

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,479
with Rob and Dave Watson and smoke with

66
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,818
them and pick their brains and

67
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,159
yeah I don't know how to equate it for

68
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,780
anyone else but it's like yeah to hang

69
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,900
out with the people that inspired You

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,560
and Your Heroes and then for them beyond

71
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,360
your expectations those are some of my

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,120
greatest moments as hanging out that's

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,160
rare people yeah rare for them to

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,659
actually live up to expectations too as

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,098
I've learned especially in the seed

76
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,539
World bro yeah it's hard

77
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:13,859
so when when you take it from there

78
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,419
you're getting you finished the book

79
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,739
like when did you start buying your

80
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,919
first seeds and getting into the seed

81
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,860
game did you know what it was I I after

82
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,818
reading hashish I then got myself Jorge

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,440
Savannah's grow Bible

84
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:30,958
decided that I needed to read that front

85
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,000
to back before I properly got all the

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,340
equipment because I had grown I'd grown

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,979
a plant outdoors grown a few of a friend

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,539
but made silly mistakes some dried

89
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,098
outdoor plants by putting them in

90
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,579
plastic bags and putting them in the air

91
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:47,818
in that in a warm place yeah yeah

92
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:50,280
exactly you didn't know we knew like I

93
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,439
decided I'm gonna read the book once I

94
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,878
read that book at the back of the book

95
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,680
there was websites and we're talking 99

96
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,378
2000 now yeah just from the on the

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,879
Millennium point and in the back was

98
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:07,639
seeds direct and overgrow.com yeah

99
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,878
that's right

100
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:14,219
into overgrow.com Heaven Stairway all

101
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,079
these different websites blew my mind

102
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,379
bro I became it's making the hair stand

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,519
up for my arms like I must have spent

104
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:26,279
like months and months just like through

105
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:31,079
the night just spending hours apart on

106
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:33,899
hours refreshing threads and the strain

107
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,599
guide on overgrowth I dismissed half my

108
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,459
school knowledge in my brain in favor of

109
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,400
the strain base off of overgrown that

110
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,739
just replaced like I'm like chemistry I

111
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,179
can push that out geography I don't need

112
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,639
that for a while history don't worry

113
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,579
stream wide

114
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,160
grow bible these are the things that

115
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:56,219
became a priority to me and yeah I just

116
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,740
became obsessed from neighborhood and

117
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,800
then to begin with

118
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,900
like a lot of Growers I was afraid to

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,759
spend money on seeds you know it's like

120
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,879
when you work a job you're getting paid

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,919
200 pound a week

122
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:13,740
even back then it was still like 80

123
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,680
pounds yeah for a pack of serious seeds

124
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,360
or th seeds or you know the big the big

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,759
four that were kind of like God forbid

126
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,919
you want Scentsy and you got to pay 350

127
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,520
pounds or something ridiculous it was

128
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:25,519
just not available

129
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,559
yeah so I started a few different ones

130
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,619
of those and then it was kind of like

131
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,600
just constantly like obsessing over like

132
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,519
overgrown things like that but at that

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,879
point still I was terrified about

134
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:54,060
actually ordering seeds from a website

135
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:57,120
sure so these times I was buying them

136
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,918
from head shops that were like I could

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,160
actually drive to and pick up the seeds

138
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:05,038
so it gave me a very limited amount of

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,560
what I could actually grow yeah and I

140
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,439
was growing like those kind of Nirvana

141
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,600
things where I went through like the the

142
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,240
White Widow that they did the White

143
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,780
Rhino that they did skunk number 11

144
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,418
which was a Lemon Skunk yeah I did a few

145
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:25,079
uh shimmertz alert like a few different

146
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,698
kind of ak-48 at all you know what I

147
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,339
didn't you know that's the one that I

148
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,139
went for that issue it was so popular

149
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,138
back there now I was like one of the big

150
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,639
rip-off ones yeah it was that that

151
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,019
Crystal Cristal and then um and there

152
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,478
isn't that oh doubleicious yeah yeah

153
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,799
yeah yeah what their their version of

154
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,800
bubble gum was the one that I wanted so

155
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,759
so so after a little while I I

156
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:56,399
discovered like the seeds direct was

157
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,639
actually in Kingston which was kind of

158
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:02,399
just outside London oh no [ __ ] so I

159
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,800
phoned them and said like can I come to

160
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,620
your store do you have a shop yeah sure

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,020
enough they had an actual walk-in shop

162
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,139
there was a little road and when you

163
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,159
went there Gypsy Nirvana and his wife at

164
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,100
the time

165
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,880
who later split from him and had an

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,500
affair with plural and Mongoose

167
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,500
yeah but at this moment they had free

168
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,538
shops they got the seed shop the head

169
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,478
shop and the grow shop

170
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:33,000
so I went down there and I bought some

171
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,579
Boggle gum because I wanted to try

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,699
something American yeah bubblegum things

173
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:42,060
bog was online he was so active he was

174
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,220
helpful he interacted with people he

175
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,199
just came across like a good person and

176
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,259
the fact that he communicated with you

177
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,259
made me want to choose him as oh yeah

178
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,240
the brand that I went with so I got some

179
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,560
of those seeds and there was other

180
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,538
things like the thing that always

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,000
appealed to me about seeds direct back

182
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,918
in the day was all the freebies yeah buy

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,680
one pack of seeds and you'd get like

184
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,240
five other different things yeah and

185
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,060
back then I remember Gypsy was giving

186
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,300
away freebies that were like G13 hybrids

187
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,418
yeah they were in Cross orange something

188
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,639
G13 cross something kills like I'm not

189
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,560
sure who made them where but I remember

190
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,139
I've got some of those and a few

191
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,819
different things so that was kind of my

192
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,680
first foray into like some American

193
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,400
genetics and some different things like

194
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,038
that

195
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,258
wow yeah I remember he carried that G13

196
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,819
stuff all the way up until they got

197
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,379
busted I think like you he kept doing

198
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,940
the project all the way through Dutch

199
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,200
grown like when Dutch ground popped up

200
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,620
and was selling seeds I remember they

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,820
did a G13 BX I want to say yep even that

202
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,259
but I don't know who made those original

203
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,000
ones I'd love to know what they're

204
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,399
supposed I think it was something in

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,278
Switzerland like what Swiss made one of

206
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,139
those kind of places like out that way I

207
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:54,600
would presume because

208
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,100
of them it gives you that it came from

209
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,639
those kind of places where there was

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,920
excessive amounts of seed yeah bulk bulk

211
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,179
buying yeah yeah those are the days when

212
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,039
you had to remember you used to have the

213
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,559
skunk number one but uh from Sam

214
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,199
scopeman oh yeah yeah I think as well

215
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,139
yeah there was also the skunk Thai Haze

216
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,879
freebies yep Durban yeah there's an

217
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,720
urban one as well there was a Durban

218
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,000
cross

219
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,180
yeah that stuff a lot of those went out

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,059
you know what that's skunk Haze I I

221
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:26,399
remember crazy composer grew one out it

222
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,899
grew up almost like a year

223
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
one of the most disappointing things

224
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,879
I've ever smoked in my life I bet dude I

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,980
can't even imagine like I was so

226
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,539
heartbroken you know when you're like oh

227
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,240
you're thinking to yourself man's gone

228
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:43,259
to so much effort yeah all this thing

229
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,659
out forever basically and man it just

230
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,759
didn't [ __ ] bang those ones are just

231
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:50,039
so hit and miss those kind of plants oh

232
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,480
yeah they're still very weird daily

233
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,740
variant

234
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,539
yeah so after after Nirvana

235
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,159
um in your foreign to the forums when

236
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:02,278
did you start getting like kind of more

237
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,199
tied in genetically and start uh more

238
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,299
experimenting on your own

239
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,420
do you know what the key thing was was

240
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,179
to start going to the icy med cup that

241
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,039
was the key thing because up until that

242
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,579
point you didn't know anyone you weren't

243
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,039
meeting no one like I I told nobody one

244
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,459
of the first rules in the book yep well

245
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,500
they said that is one is tell nobody

246
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:27,719
nobody nobody yeah this was the time

247
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,539
like it I don't think people nowadays

248
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,120
can conceive the level of secrecy I

249
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:36,299
would sit I sat and smoked with good

250
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,759
close friends of mine for years without

251
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:41,278
them knowing that what we were smoking I

252
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:45,139
had grown and that's so hard not to to

253
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,139
one you want to tell your best friends

254
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,259
I know dude like you have to pretend you

255
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,259
went and picked it up and do the whole

256
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:55,259
facade oh do you know what's so funny me

257
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,939
and another icy mag member Dr D he's

258
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,679
yeah like he used to live in the

259
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,959
Midlands and when he would come down to

260
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,338
London everyone would be like oh is that

261
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,578
your weed guy and I'd be like yeah yeah

262
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,440
that's who I get my weed from

263
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,578
so I get my weed from so at least we

264
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
kind of claim to bring it downstairs

265
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,919
ourselves from being the guy and had

266
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,500
someone else to kind of just distract

267
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,120
people with because yeah it was such a

268
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,059
worrying time then and when we went to

269
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,480
the IC med cup even then I was still

270
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:27,899
dubious of like talking with English

271
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,360
people so I'm more communicated with the

272
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,399
American people that I'd spoken to and

273
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,820
it's those kind of connections that

274
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,700
started to get me a lot more genetics I

275
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,379
also met Brightside the icmag member

276
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,019
that's a great person that had the

277
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:46,078
cheese cut and that was the first Elite

278
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,399
cut that I got and that was because I

279
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,199
kind of

280
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,440
back in the day you had to earn your

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,860
stripes to get Cuts absolutely with Bud

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,480
show some passion show some good bud and

283
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,399
then if you were a good person and you

284
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,620
were doing good work people would offer

285
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,019
you Cuts you never really asked for cuts

286
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,060
it was kind of taboo never had to yeah

287
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,399
yeah it was improper it was improper to

288
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,439
ask for cuts we all knew that you you

289
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,059
find your place in a group and if people

290
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,800
trust you something sometimes [ __ ]

291
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,599
happens sometimes it doesn't you don't

292
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,159
you know you're not in control of that

293
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,778
but it shouldn't matter anyways you know

294
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,719
like that's that's the attitude of it

295
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:24,539
for sure yeah still there so yeah that

296
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,320
was that was kind of that point there

297
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,879
and yeah but like for me I was I was

298
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,700
just obsessed with American genetics

299
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,320
right yeah once I started to read like

300
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,240
I'd always been obsessed with things

301
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,459
like High Times you know when it told

302
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,839
you the the different but in different

303
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:44,578
states oh yeah yeah

304
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,339
so I was always curious of these

305
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,838
different strains different names and

306
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,880
these are the things that I wanted to

307
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,200
hunt for so that's when I started to

308
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,480
kind of like

309
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,278
use the people I admit to kind of get

310
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,959
different seeds to hunt out the

311
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,360
different genetics they had like cushion

312
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,699
them that some blueberry things some

313
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,980
like things that weren't train wreck you

314
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,440
know like yeah there were certain Cuts

315
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,600
uh deep wreck I remember which was a

316
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,740
deep chunk cross train wreck like yeah I

317
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,778
was just trying to get all the different

318
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,839
things that were either in Canada or

319
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:18,720
that I'd seen people grow in so it was

320
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,720
just then an obsession to just Fino hunt

321
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,060
and try as many seeds as possible and

322
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,040
grow out as many things as possible and

323
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,078
once you've been to an icy mad cup and

324
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,419
met people now

325
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,399
the buying seeds wasn't really an issue

326
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,159
because at this stage I'm a grower I

327
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,620
don't sell no bud I never sold any bud I

328
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,240
just grew for myself smoked it all so

329
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,339
spending big amounts of money on seeds

330
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,019
weren't possible so once I went to an

331
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,139
icy makeup and met a whole bunch of

332
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,778
Growers from America Canada all around

333
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,879
Europe met a couple of nice English

334
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:52,919
people that I could then feel safe with

335
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,500
yeah it just opened up the world of

336
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,259
genetics and all of a sudden yeah we

337
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,500
were able to trade carts and I got a

338
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:03,899
Cinderella 99 car I had the cheese car

339
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,759
there was a few different ones that were

340
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,799
like being passed around and all five

341
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,278
haze there was like a cut from in the

342
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,838
south of England oh wow yeah that that's

343
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,259
why I'm really curious to try a lot of

344
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,740
these American cuts that are potentially

345
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:21,419
nl5 Haze Cuts because we had our like we

346
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,600
had our different areas around the

347
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:27,120
country that had little Famous Cuts Like

348
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,399
North London was famous for like the

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,379
hazes super silver haze there would be

350
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,320
Neville's there would always be solid

351
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:37,338
hazes out of North London in South

352
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,720
London there would always be lemon lemon

353
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,480
haze there was like lemon was always

354
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,278
famous in that part like every little

355
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,740
part of London there'd be Pockets with

356
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,198
famous little strains that would would

357
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,600
make a little Mark did cheese like kind

358
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,139
of permeate all of London that's exact

359
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,839
what happened is Exodus Luton where the

360
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,299
collective was the spread the cheese

361
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,420
that was like 40 minutes outside of

362
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,819
London okay it was a free party thing so

363
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,919
then this cheese cut would spread and

364
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,379
start to hit different places so it was

365
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,559
down in Bristol it went up to Liverpool

366
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:16,379
it was in London so slowly it was spread

367
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,359
around and you'd all of a sudden start

368
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,639
to hear more and more people having it

369
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,259
but early 2000s a lot of people didn't

370
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,299
have it right it weren't something that

371
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,819
was wrong not at all it was a myth

372
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:30,299
they're like like most Cuts back then it

373
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,480
was a myth you had to find someone and

374
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:36,120
them big Buddha bought the cheese seed

375
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,620
line out and that like made the murky

376
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,500
for the original car and it was

377
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,360
absolutely used in but can you can you

378
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,339
talk a little bit here about the the

379
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,360
actual history that you know as you know

380
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,040
it for the cheese yep well basically

381
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,379
there's a story in like one of the weed

382
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,139
World magazines that talks about the guy

383
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:58,220
who actually forced it to the person

384
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:02,220
that we know to have the car

385
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:05,579
which was an online member called of the

386
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,879
Hill yeah and of the hill was on UK 420

387
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,458
he was what he was the grower who passed

388
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:15,419
it to The Exodus Collective which was

389
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:17,819
the three-party like little society that

390
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:22,559
lived there and kind of done all of the

391
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:25,260
the Raves and what happened is it was

392
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,479
started by someone else passed on to of

393
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:30,720
the hill and then he took it to the

394
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,159
Exodus Collective where it was crossed

395
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,379
passed out

396
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,240
etc etc and was he one of the people who

397
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,360
knew it was skunk wine originally and is

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,919
he I believe so yeah he he was friends

399
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
with the person who actually popped the

400
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,539
seeds and bought the seeds back from

401
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,278
Amsterdam yeah and then there was a

402
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:52,500
thread on UK 420 where of the Hill

403
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,899
references crosses being made with his

404
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,720
cut and one of the crosses he mentions

405
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,879
is something called back to cheese and

406
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,000
the back to cheese was a cross that

407
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:06,720
brights I did with a Casey brains mail

408
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,058
oh wow so that was kind of why the

409
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,419
bright side cut had such reverence

410
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:15,178
because it was verified by the guy who

411
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:18,120
passed it to The Exodus people so bright

412
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:21,439
side knew this guy so in essence it's uh

413
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:24,298
what the like to coin the term

414
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,279
pre-exodus because the pre-pre Exodus

415
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,859
yeah

416
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:33,298
that's just had to be said for the sheer

417
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:35,339
Journey it has to but it is

418
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:36,839
I've always wanted I've always wondered

419
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,699
about the story because over here you

420
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,500
know like I would I would I would hear

421
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,419
about cheese we had a cheese cut over

422
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,960
here that I believe came down by a

423
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,640
vision Creator somehow and um you know

424
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,259
we all run that one and it's highly

425
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,538
variant sometimes it'll smell a little

426
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:54,119
Berry sometimes fruity sometimes foot

427
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,160
Funk cheese honestly sometimes yeah yeah

428
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,379
it's all over the place bro and it's

429
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,820
it's hard to explain to people like I

430
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,260
remember when I got the cut a few times

431
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,599
from people I've got oh no this is a

432
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:06,000
fake one toss this is a fake worm toss

433
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,038
you know like after blooming it looks

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,960
apart but it's not it you have to real

435
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,460
one grows kind of almost lateral when it

436
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,100
gets to week five it all just flops over

437
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,919
yeah yeah yeah and it's Woody Woody as

438
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:20,879
[ __ ] the stems are super Woody

439
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,559
12. yeah so after growing this I started

440
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,200
hearing from the UK nah man you need to

441
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,819
grow The psychosis you need to grow all

442
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,200
these other ones and I I've and then I

443
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,460
heard about the bright side and I'm like

444
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,580
well which

445
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,679
yeah so what is the psychosis what's the

446
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,480
there's another one too I think

447
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,059
um

448
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,160
psychosis is I is like another seed that

449
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,079
was from a different Cross or it's a

450
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,580
cross I'm not sure exactly what the

451
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,058
psychosis is but there's also another

452
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:50,639
one called delivers yes this is a cut up

453
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:53,700
in Sheffield which is a Kind of Blue

454
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,679
kind of cheesy more like on the berry

455
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,620
side of it yeah they're all in that kind

456
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,080
of very similar family and over the

457
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:03,019
years I I think with a lot of people

458
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,519
they've been muddled mixed up

459
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,038
interchanged and that's where a lot of

460
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,220
the confusion comes from because they do

461
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,279
all have those similar notes in

462
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,740
different varying degrees so it's always

463
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,139
been difficult to kind of verify which

464
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,038
ones are which unless you can trace them

465
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,559
back

466
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,240
to the original people like that's why

467
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,759
it's so important and people don't get

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,079
it like it you if you can't trace it

469
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,119
back to the original person you're

470
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,740
almost playing in a way and always kind

471
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,500
of just playing it trying to figure it

472
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,419
out like I mean even even the American

473
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
cut you know we can trace back to vision

474
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,538
and then

475
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,160
you know a little bit past that and then

476
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,619
it's just kind of like well

477
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,360
which one is it we will never really

478
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,699
know unless we have like you come over

479
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,558
in here and check it out a few different

480
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,940
grows so you can see how different it is

481
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:52,259
in each different girl and get an idea

482
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,940
of someone that has a good experience

483
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,599
inspectors got the one that Vision

484
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,340
create ahead right yeah yeah yeah

485
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,038
I think that is the bright side part you

486
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:06,359
think so I think it is just because of

487
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:09,119
the time span yeah when he got it it

488
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,459
fits the time when Brightside had passed

489
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,459
it out to a few people and it then got

490
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,279
passed on to a few more within a short

491
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,400
space of time and I think I do remember

492
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,619
during that period the the the crosses

493
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,160
that were made were there and it being

494
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:28,079
verified so yeah for my money I would

495
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,200
put a strong possibility on that being

496
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,119
the legit one but I know recently the

497
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,120
bright side one's been sourced I know

498
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,298
psychosis has been sourced uh the blues

499
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:42,058
AK livers that's been sourced so is it

500
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:44,639
over here in the US you mean Genoa well

501
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:49,500
I I should I should mention specifically

502
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:52,100
Rest in paradise Stoney NYC who died

503
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,079
recently because he was one of the most

504
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:57,000
Elite people as far as connecting

505
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,119
genetics passing them to different

506
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,798
people having a stable of genetics and

507
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,439
he was one of the people that kept

508
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:07,798
things like The psychosis around he got

509
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,580
it sent to America recently I believe it

510
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:14,038
was it arrived the day he died and it

511
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:16,079
was saved by friends so I believe that

512
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,259
that cut has managed to be salvaged and

513
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,779
is over there so yeah it only would

514
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,599
definitely want that heartbreaking this

515
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,359
guy honestly when people realized the

516
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,939
part that he played in so many different

517
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,699
seed companies so many different

518
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,038
genetics to so many different forms so

519
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,720
many different things by preserving and

520
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,640
connecting people and passing genetics

521
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,700

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,859
lot of people but something we both had

592
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,019
in common was like the Canada Bible and

593
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,839
how influential that also was in our in

594
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,819
our clone searchings that was wild to

595

00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:45,740
in general

601
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,259
I was obsessed I just wanted purple bud

602
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:55,639
I was desperate for it I've seen uh the

603
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,640
Blackberry who was it the guy

604
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:04,980
bro I saw that neon purple [ __ ] and I

605
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,720
was flipping out I was obsessed for ever

606
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,819
until I got my hands on it you know I

607
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,579
needed it that that drove a very big

608
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:14,158
like purple magenta it's crazy we ended

609

that with the s1s the black various ones

610
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,820
because remember like I think like Gypsy

611
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,400
Nirvana took him off Oregon kid and

612
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,220
never paid him or some crazy [ __ ] but he

613
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,798
then gave him away his freebies or like

614
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,079
that hand or something but I grew him

615
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:31,798
out and had one that was that color wow

616
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,379

617
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:37,619
had PM in my whole life I never had PM

618
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,260
ever again and there's one plant in a

619
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,359
small little shed yeah would get PM I'd

620
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,339
wash it off it would come back yeah no

621
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,000

622
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,000
over yeah

623
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,298
finding that and then being like what

624
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,120
the [ __ ] what can I do with it

625
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:58,619
nothing and also a lot of that

626
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,259
Blackberry stuff people didn't realize

627
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:04,379
that it it tends to dry brownish looking

628
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:07,500
not as pretty and it it smelled very

629
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,000
dusty it just didn't keep the smell very

630
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,419
well from yeah literally the black

631
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,359
Russian yeah the licorice like a bit of

632
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,460
licorice kind of flavor yeah yeah and

633
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,158
you know the Bible was wild bro that

634
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,679
that whole thing photography to see such

635
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,039
beautiful photographs was revolutionary

636
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,778
like better descriptions whatever it was

637
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,759
full of [ __ ] or not how much truth it

638
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:32,220
was to it it was so beautifully written

639
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,440
it was so detailed it was just wonderful

640
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,360
the time like even even though like

641
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,340
looking back we can say this is accurate

642
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,500
this isn't or we think this is less

643
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,658
accurate or whatever for the time he

644
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,298
still nailed it dude like it's hard to

645
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,799
even at this day and age to be like I'm

646
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:48,900
gonna write a book and try to be as

647
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,639
accurate as I can I would have a hard

648
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,400
time being as accurate as he was looking

649
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,140
back oh bro

650
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,759
yeah no one wanted a talking people yeah

651
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,100
so to actually get people to discuss

652
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,140
things and take responsibility now

653
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:04,819
you'll get 20 people claiming the cup

654
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:08,640
exactly no one was playing with it

655
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:10,678
no one wanted no one to know it was it

656
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
was yeah it was super different to how

657
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,419
it was now yeah and and finding out

658
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,980
later on like I remember reading the

659
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,840
candle Bible and stuff and like chasing

660
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,759
the super dog and whatnot and then later

661
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,379
on becoming friends with not so dog and

662
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,879
realizing he's one of the super dog guys

663
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,100
and that he's the purpose guy to help

664
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,980
Jason King with that it was a trip it's

665
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:31,439
a trip bro for me yeah it's like it was

666
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,000
at the pivotal moment was going to the

667
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:39,240
icy med cup the year that res Smokey the

668
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,019
puff master and Junior it's all in at

669
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:47,819
the sour diesel oh yeah that was the

670
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:50,460
year like 2000 and I believe six yeah

671
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:53,879
would have had to been yeah I believe

672
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,980
six and also at that was their heads

673
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,159
great forehead

674
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,159
and I love those guys they became like

675
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,760
family to me I've never seen him like

676
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,860
res was a dick was always a dick in real

677
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,440
life to everyone like that's how it was

678
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:13,678
I never had no desire to be cool with

679
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,820
res but then what had happened is

680
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,640
they became friends of him yes because I

681
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:23,460
was tight with them and the crazy thing

682
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,340
was was that as much as a [ __ ] [ __ ]

683
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,700
bag as res was he had all these good

684
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:32,220
people around him yeah

685
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,798
and his wife amazing people the most

686
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,500
beautiful people Jimmy knits the most

687
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,259
insanely good grower I'd love to know

688
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,140
what happened to him uh he's got I think

689
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,720
he was so burnt and so traumatized and

690
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,580
so dragged into the whole situation it

691
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,220
probably like put him off for Life bro

692
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:54,418
he had probably had like effects on his

693
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:57,298
real life in ways for like things are

694
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,820
super crazy so it's like that year there

695
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:02,460
when I got to go to Amsterdam and all of

696
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:05,519
a sudden I got to smoke East Coast Sour

697
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,558
Diesel grown by all of them rez's was

698
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,139
similar how similar were they between

699
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,599
the three Jimmy nits was by far the best

700
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,179
grower he was he was a good girl sounds

701
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,519
above everyone else that was a funny

702
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,380
thing like I'll get on to later about

703
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,658
the levels of Growers and the

704
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,940
revelations as I started to find out

705
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,220
what people were doing and capable of

706
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,558
and what grows because a lot of people

707
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,798
talk smack about rez's broke I'll tell

708
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,200
you all about he's growing a bit Yeah so

709
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:37,918
basically what happened is I got real

710
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,620
friendly with their heads and they gave

711
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,480
me the Casey Jones seeds later on when

712
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,239
they went back to America they sent me a

713
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,919
bunch of seeds so that then was my thing

714
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,720
I started growing out a bunch of head

715
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:54,179
seeds I grew out the Casey Jones

716
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,058
2007 I turned up with the Casey Jones

717
00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:00,120
from seed entered it and got second

718
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:03,359
place and I got second place to jlp who

719
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,038
went at Sour Diesel oh wow jlp for

720
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,859
anyone who doesn't know John Lee

721
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,440
pendermore yeah

722
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:13,798
is a legend Beyond levels of Beyond

723
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,159
levels Beyond levels this guy

724
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:19,379
a million seeds yeah he would he was the

725
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,140
only person that was allowed to get

726
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:25,740
addresses from people on like overgrow

727
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,799
icy mag like every Forum that he was on

728
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,679
they would allow him to interact with

729
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,179
Growers directly like I see mag he was

730
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,580
the only person that could get addresses

731
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,320
and send seeds to people otherwise you'd

732
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:40,819
be in trouble for that [ __ ] get banned

733
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:44,038
so fast he would do all kinds of crazy

734
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:46,558
f2s and hybrids and all stuff like that

735
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:48,658
but because he was doing a lot of f2s

736
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,940
and things like that he never sold

737
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,980
anything yeah he just gave the seeds

738
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,778
away and what you would get is a little

739
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,759
envelope with one of those little round

740
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:59,038
discs with the scenes in it and on the

741
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,079
back it would say 21 Jump Street as the

742
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,778
return address because his name was John

743
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,178
Lee pedemore jlp and there's some

744
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,038
Connection in a TV show or something

745
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,778
like that I don't know this as an

746
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,000
English person but years ago yes yes

747
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,679
yeah I found this out years later just

748
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,440
out of curiosity about

749
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,100
yeah because I noticed it somewhere and

750
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,259
this guy gave out just constantly to

751
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:25,139
thousands of Growers he'd send seeds out

752
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:26,759
his own money too yeah it was amazing

753
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,620
bro the amount of genetics that he gave

754
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,359
out I would love to know what happened

755
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,719
to him too there's so many dudes that

756
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,398
have just yeah

757
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,460
so many it's awesome when people do pop

758
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:41,699
back up on on Instagram if you find

759
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:46,380
people yeah it is man I grew out there

760
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:49,380
and once I won the icy med cart the

761
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,059
second place not long after that I went

762
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:56,100
out to Maine

763
00:31:51,058 --> 00:32:00,418
okay the main one composer well as

764
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:02,939
everyone now knows Maine is where Rez

765
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,659
the heads and everyone involved in that

766
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,460
crazy [ __ ] was living yes

767
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:10,380
family to me and this is the thing yeah

768
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,120
their heads this is what breaks my heart

769
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,600
it's like their heads got caught up in a

770
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:17,639
crazy thing yeah it's like and they

771
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:20,879
cooperated with the authorities and it's

772
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,340
like those are like family to me I spent

773
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,320
yeah Mrs head and the kid came to

774
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:27,720
England stayed at my house because Dutch

775
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,879
Broome was such a [ __ ] yes they left her

776
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,380
they left her house and come and stayed

777
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,600
at my house when they visited England

778
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,520
and that's how we became really tired

779
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,980
because that's wrong was such a [ __ ] to

780
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,720
them that they were like upset and I

781
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,038
said just come and stay at my house and

782
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,659
I'll go and stay at my cousin's house

783
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,278
for the folks who don't know Dutch

784
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:48,500
ground was a ex-carp it's called

785
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:51,298
yep

786
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,519
and you know what I had that confirmed

787
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:56,940
by two different people as well yeah the

788
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,879
first person that told told me was uh

789
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,860
someone who worked for Gypsy was told by

790
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,659
pom plural of mongoose yeah yeah yeah

791
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:07,798
and then

792
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:10,740
Miss head was told by Karen's mum oh

793
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:14,639
well that'll solve it real fast so that

794
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,220
one is the [ __ ] 100 confirmation yes

795
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,220
dude there's no denying and the thing is

796
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,860
yeah what breaks my heart yeah is that

797
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,659
I know to how the domino effect went and

798
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,839
by the time it got to the heads they're

799
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,480
the only ones that actually had kids

800
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:32,459
Dutch grown had nothing

801
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,500
there's nothing and by time they got to

802
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,480
the heads and the other two had all

803
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,700
rolled there was nowhere else for them

804
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,019
to go other than to roll two yeah I mean

805
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,538
they were only rolling on themselves

806
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,880
that's it yeah and and the sad thing is

807
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,379
yeah that heads had fallen out of rest

808
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,419
because they realized what a toxic

809
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,700
person he was and that's the saddest

810
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,860
part of all is that they had broken away

811
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,778
from him almost a year prior to that

812
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:57,479
just hit him he had nothing to do with

813
00:33:54,778 --> 00:34:00,480
him so when he got busted I'm sure he

814
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,058
had no qualms in dragging them into it

815
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,038
and and the difference between them is

816
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,619
is that their heads have never come back

817
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:11,639
onto the scene because that was so burnt

818
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:13,858
so hurt so ashamed so sad so like

819
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,720
distressed by the whole thing that they

820
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:17,940
don't feel that they have a place back

821
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,678
in the scene so for these other people

822
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,378
who are rats to think that they can come

823
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,418
back in is crazy mind [ __ ] you know

824
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,918
it's weird though like I don't think the

825
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,319
heads would have an issue coming back in

826
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,638
these days

827
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,139
snitch on people yeah like they're

828
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,878
actually good people but oh people

829
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,460
openly snitch on people that are real

830
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,918
bad people that people still support to

831
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,720
this day yeah so to me it's like like if

832
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,759
they have guilt over that and [ __ ] like

833
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,199
we we know how it went down we know how

834
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,480
everybody folded we know how it all

835
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,338
wrapped up at this point you know like

836
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,378
we know who the real bad people are in

837
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:51,480
that in that whole situation and who

838
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,159
weren't and who weren't who are the

839
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,800
victims of the situation bro it was

840
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,119
crazy you can imagine yeah I I go out to

841
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,300
America

842
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,480
I mean I'm staying with the heads we go

843
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,420
meet res this guy is the biggest breeder

844
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,019
he's moving oh yeah he's moving 80 000

845
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,960
cells on a weekend drop like I have the

846
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,940
DNA of America yeah and like online he's

847
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,199
a prick but obviously I've got some

848
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,300
reverence for him because he's doing

849
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,399
good work and I can see what he's got

850
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,619
his quality I've grown out some of his

851
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,660
stuff there's some fire there like I'm

852
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,700
not a fool to what he's putting out and

853
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,019
like everyone knows at the time there

854
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,059
was certain stuff he had that no one

855
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:33,059
else did so it was like if you wanted to

856
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:35,820
grow this stuff regardless yeah you had

857
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:38,460
to get it from him yeah so I had high

858
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,380
expectations and when I went there bro

859
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,179
I'll be honest with you when people say

860
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,220
that he had a shitty little bro he

861
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:47,039
didn't he had a beautiful growth his

862
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:49,879
growth was underground beautifully

863
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:53,579
hidden all nice light separate bedroom

864
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,680
all the lights ventilation for the time

865
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,560
yeah yeah what it was

866
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,899
any any people that check [ __ ] really

867
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,420
the guy is a [ __ ] I don't like it yeah

868
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,519
yeah for sure

869
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,800
we were terrible bro because you've got

870
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,920
good workers to come in and people don't

871
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,800
start playing yeah yeah but that being

872
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,960
said this guy didn't know what the [ __ ]

873
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,660
he was doing it was all right like most

874
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,179
of them he got to where he did bro he he

875
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,940
went to a local grow shop he had New

876
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,279
York City Diesel from Soma and the grow

877
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,500
shop guy had the East Coast Tower diesel

878
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,500
cup and swapped him for Somers New York

879
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,619
City Diesel and that's it and that's the

880
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,838
birth of res making it just by that one

881
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,539
person giving him that cut and the thing

882
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,759
is just by accident that's it and when I

883
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:43,679
went to his house one time bro his whole

884
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,660
crop was just covered in powdery mildew

885
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,639
and I'm like bro you cropped covered in

886
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:50,879
PM he's like what what's that what like

887
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:53,219
I'm like that yeah no surely this

888
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,000
[ __ ] I'm looking to to tell me

889
00:36:53,219 --> 00:37:00,239
stuff knows what PM is true enough he

890
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,159
didn't have a [ __ ] clue and it was a

891
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,919
lot of his breeding was the blind lead

892
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,379
in The Blind it was oh it is it was luck

893
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,240
he had other people doing projects He

894
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,220
was like the other people he was saying

895
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,379
oh this guy's a buffoon this while I was

896
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:15,899
there once a house burnt down like we

897
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,880
were growing it like crazy [ __ ] happened

898
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,800
bro like yeah yeah house is burning down

899
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,320
we were like everyone's worrying right

900
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,060
everybody it just sounds like a

901
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,920
[ __ ] waiting to happen over there

902
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,019
with everybody if you give someone

903
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,300
enough good genetics no matter how much

904
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:33,059
of a class the [ __ ] they are they'll do

905
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,500
some good work and it's it's real yeah

906
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:36,500
swerve exactly

907
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:42,119
where he really hit gold is when he had

908
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,159
someone like grateful Head around all of

909
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,599
a sudden grateful Head was doing the

910
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,399
real [ __ ] hard work and the

911
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,440
selections and the and the solid work

912
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,440
when it happened to a lot of the chem

913
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,500
work it was like the original cross to

914
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,079
the uh was it there

915
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,019
Hindu Christian done it too I believe so

916
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,180
like Hindu Kush or M39 one of the two

917
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:04,980
he done the first cross a lot of the

918
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:07,078
back crosses and further work for the

919
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,000
chem staff is done by grateful Head I

920
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,680
didn't know that yeah because what was

921
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,539
happening his head was doing some chem

922
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,098
stuff he was doing some sales stuff

923
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,480
someone else was doing some other stuff

924
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,480
and they had different projects

925
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,099
everywhere and like I say a lot of the

926
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,900
things from res it was all hit and miss

927
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,760
like one of the do you remember when

928
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,980
he'd done his first Femme project when

929
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
it was abusive reversed no I don't

930
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,820
remember that what was that about

931
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,760
because they [ __ ] up the room and the

932
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,800
abusive home so they just [ __ ] it let's

933
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,640
release them and it was some of his best

934
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,640
work oh

935
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:46,559
that but that was the thing one once I

936
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,780
was over there bro I got to see so much

937
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,000
genetics yeah can you imagine coming

938
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,519
from England and having tried a couple

939
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,880
cuts here and there tried some crosses

940
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,800
tried some OG Kush s ones tried little

941
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,380
bits and pieces sure tried some

942
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,160
different cuts but now I'm on the East

943
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,980
Coast

944
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,199
I'm smoking the East Coast Sour Diesel

945
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,300
I'm smoking all the chem family that

946
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,939
chemdog had that time and passed on to

947
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,060
Res plus we're smoking everything that

948
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,280
Jimmy nitz was having around that time

949
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:19,440
was also getting all the stuff from OG

950
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,519

957
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:45,779
that's the goat for me like I love that

958
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,760
girl I have such fondness for her has

959
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,980
that made it over to the UK and cut form

960
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,060
uh yeah I believe a couple of people

961
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,639
have got it I I haven't verified it or

962
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,820
seen or known who it's come from and in

963
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,900
recent years hearing how many fake ones

964
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,539
there are

965
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,619
I'm getting my one from my own source

966
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:06,659
rather than getting the one that's

967
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,220
already here I just wish we had an

968
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:09,899
easier way to get stuff across the place

969
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,279
it still sucks like if you're not really

970
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,260
good at tissue culture it's still a pain

971
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,300
in the ass yes that's really where we're

972
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,160
at now luckily yeah people are picking

973
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,780
up on the tissue culture thing yeah I

974
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,219
never got good at it yeah you've got

975
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,040
people in Barcelona that are getting

976
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:24,539
onto the tissue culture now so Sloan of

977
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,699
it surely things are coming together

978
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,800
with that and it just makes it so much

979
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,179
better we can really preserve all these

980
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,560
genetics for our common how many times

981
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,299
have you had to get rid of a genetic

982
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,880
because it's like how many mums can you

983
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,460
actually keep oh yeah it was a very

984
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,119
different like place we were living in

985
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,639
in the world and so many times like I

986
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,920
always used to have a hit list of

987
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,779
genetics and for a new one to come in it

988
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,480
had to like be better than one of the

989
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,540
ones yeah that fitted a certain aspect

990
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,980
of my life because for me cannabis is

991
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:58,320
about a feeling it's about the effect

992
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,820
it's like I love flavors but I smoke

993
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,700
cannabis because of how it makes me feel

994
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,859
what it does for my

995
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:07,500
personality character my well-being my

996
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:09,299
feeling of Wellness my health pain

997
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,239
medication all of these kind of things

998
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,000
so to trial the different things that's

999
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,979
kind of the real key thing and that's

1000
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,659
rare dude for a guy from the UK to be

1001
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,519
able to say like I had the you know I

1002
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:21,960
smoke the Kansas I smoked the diesel I

1003
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,699
smoke the snow dog because like for

1004
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,320
people listening now I think that coming

1005
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:26,819
to cannabis later they've always assumed

1006
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,460
that these things just make it across

1007
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:34,680
the pond super easy back in I remember

1008
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:36,659
in 2007 I was trying to to get clones to

1009
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,578
someone in Spain and it was super hard

1010
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:40,618
we were spending tons of money trying to

1011
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,119
do this before we were really for tissue

1012
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,099
culture was really an option even at

1013
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,320
that point we were trying to super hard

1014
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,420
we spent tons of cash trying to get it

1015
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,039
there and it just didn't work it just

1016
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,380
made me think yeah the amount of time

1017
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,800
got picked up yeah boxes from the post

1018
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,780
office that was just like soaking wet

1019
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,240
and they're like who how the [ __ ] did

1020
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,220
you send this to me International the

1021
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,078
things just coming through like what

1022
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,699
have you fine I know you're shocked that

1023
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,960
it didn't get you popped and then of

1024
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:08,159
course the thing that could have gotten

1025
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,838
you popped you opened it up and it

1026
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,980
smells like wet cooked lettuce and

1027
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,960
you're like oh yeah

1028
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,699
bruh yeah all my first I think like the

1029
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,858
first tour free attempts that we had all

1030
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:22,219
died we weren't until like

1031
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:26,519
towards probably

1032
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:29,039
2009 around 2009 we started getting a

1033
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:32,880
lot more luck yeah with the cuts coming

1034
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,380
over like because basically like to

1035
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,380
finish off where I was going what ended

1036
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,019
up happening is that after a while you

1037
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,480
realize that res doesn't do a lot of the

1038
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:44,639
breeding and then he hits me up and says

1039
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,659
to me do you want to do a seed project

1040
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:51,480
so up until that point I had such high

1041
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:53,940
regard for breeders that I never even

1042
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,559
thought about breeding I knew friends

1043
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,858
that had done a little project there's

1044
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:01,559
that I had no I I thought this was such

1045
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:03,719
a high level thing that for me I was

1046
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,599
still learning about cannabis I was

1047
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:09,419
still trying to try everything I wanted

1048
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,160
to try I didn't feel that I knew enough

1049
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,920
about everything

1050
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,960
to do anything that yeah but that's a

1051
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,300
fair fair way of looking at it too right

1052
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,539
that was it honestly and it's like but

1053
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,400
that being said by this stage when I

1054
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:26,099
done the project or started to do a

1055
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,960
project for res at this stage we're

1056
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:32,818
talking

1057
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:35,280
2009 now I think yeah I had motor breath

1058
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,199
because Jimmy Nix was my friend so he

1059
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,319
had those seeds before they even had a

1060
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,838
name yeah so I had to like I had a motor

1061
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:45,059
breath cut that to this day I think was

1062
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,059
better than candy for Terps and better

1063
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:50,219
than OG push like it was the Perfect Two

1064
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:52,139
I I haven't tried the motor breath 15

1065
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:53,699
but if there's anything like the keeper

1066
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:56,159
that we had at connoisseur genetics at

1067
00:43:53,699 --> 00:44:00,118
the time that I selected that's one of

1068
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,799
the top five cuts I've ever had and all

1069
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,240
of the stuff do you mean it's done he

1070
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,300
was one of the people that changed my

1071
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:09,239
mind for feminized seeds because I had a

1072
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,140
leaf mango green Red Cross sfv and the

1073
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:17,578
chem cross sf3 from him I had abusive

1074
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:20,338
cross uh these or original diesel like I

1075
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,400
had lots of elite stuff I had a stable

1076
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:25,679
of maybe 15 mothers at that stage with a

1077
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,760
little bit of everything and then Rez

1078
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:32,279
wanted me to do the chem IBL oh I think

1079
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,380
I still got seeds of that so what

1080
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,839
obviously because this is the thing res

1081
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,358
had been burnt so much by giving out

1082
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:41,519
cuts to people that even people who were

1083
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,679
meant to be his friend like me that he

1084
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:47,400
had promised cuts to he didn't want to

1085
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,500
give them to like res was a weirdo at

1086
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,420
one point I remember res promising

1087
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,519
someone a car

1088
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,220
that person went to a mutual friend's

1089
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,780
house said oh is that the car because

1090
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:59,879
res said I could get one but he didn't

1091
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,040
have none ready and the guy goes yeah

1092
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,599
yeah that's the cup he can take it and

1093
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:06,420
Rez didn't really want him to have the

1094
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,760
cup so then Rez drove to the house and

1095
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,039
poisoned the car with Coke

1096
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,140
while the guy weren't looking to try and

1097
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,940
kill it so that by time he got home it

1098
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:16,799
died because he didn't really want him

1099
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,380
to have the cup with that yeah that's

1100
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,318
just above and beyond just move this

1101
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,420
[ __ ] bro yeah

1102
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,980
no so you know looking back that's why I

1103
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,380
realized oh that's why you wanted me to

1104
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,119
do the IBL because with the IBL he

1105
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,880
didn't have to send me the chemical is

1106
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,160
all he needed to do was give me chem bx2

1107
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,260
and say to me oh

1108
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:41,940
get the best females hit them with the

1109
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:45,359
best males IBL done done yeah that's it

1110
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,420
and this is the thing where it spot a

1111
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,279
fascination with selecting males for me

1112
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:53,159
because that was something I'd never

1113
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,560
done you know like normally when a good

1114
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,539
male pops up you're pissed off and you

1115
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,719
want to get rid of it but now all of a

1116
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:03,599
sudden I did like 30 40 seeds which was

1117
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,419
a higher population for back then and

1118
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,539
yeah

1119
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:13,800
and selected out three insane males bro

1120
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:17,219
like these males are insane so good had

1121
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:21,119
the seed project going and then as what

1122
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:25,098
often happens in a Prohibition era a

1123
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:28,380
house got robbed oh my God

1124
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:30,119
so I lost everything and Rez was just a

1125
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,338
piece of [ __ ] about the whole thing oh

1126
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,380
I'm sure it was kind of during that

1127
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:35,880
period that I kind of like phased out

1128
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,460
from him and realized like oh you're

1129
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,318
just a [ __ ] like a heads would cut him

1130
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,599
off he was acting like a little [ __ ]

1131
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,759
about certain things he he basically

1132
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,400
blocked me from getting the salaries or

1133
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,579
from crazy composer who was a mutual

1134
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,740
friend I'm like oh that's sad like I

1135
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,960
talked about perfect things last episode

1136
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:57,118
and for people who don't understand like

1137
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,858
people would lock specific people out of

1138
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,720
cuts just to be dicks like that was a

1139
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:03,480
thing that people did and it was really

1140
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,338
annoying bro it's really annoying when

1141
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,219
you've been at the guy's house yeah

1142
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:10,199
wrote bread within and he's you're meant

1143
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:11,699
to be like family to the guy and then

1144
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:13,439
all of a sudden you realize Oh no you're

1145
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,259
just out to serve yourself and you're

1146
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,300
just using everyone and when the when

1147
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,880
push comes to shove you ain't got no

1148
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,700
lawyer and you're just a [ __ ] a

1149
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,300
Vicodin popping douchebag who ended up

1150
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:28,799
being a rat

1151
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:32,460
the only good thing come out of it is

1152
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,400
that by time that project went I had the

1153
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,318
most incredible males and now I was

1154
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,960
excited about seeing what would happen

1155
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:42,779
if I bred them to all of my Stables

1156
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,240
because now I'm like oh I've got a

1157
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:49,500
stable of plants I've got these males

1158
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:52,139
that just have to be bred with yeah

1159
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,300
and that was kind of the spot for me to

1160
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:55,980
want to breed for myself

1161
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,720
and was that the first actual breeding

1162
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,000
project or did the males get robbed and

1163
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:02,399
that that was it well do you know

1164
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,440
actually right this is it yeah

1165
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,980
I then had a breed and project ready to

1166
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,380
go a friend of mine was selling some bud

1167
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,199
to someone he knew they came to get the

1168
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:15,838
bud turned up with two other guys pulled

1169
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:18,118
a gun on him and basically it was almost

1170
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,139
a hostage situation I just got out the

1171
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,900
shower

1172
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:24,059
I heard the room go silent you know like

1173
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,338
the guys came in and they went to the

1174
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,619
back room and I'm getting dryer and all

1175
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:31,739
of a sudden I just felt an energy shift

1176
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:34,318
yeah you got another room yeah I felt an

1177
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:35,479
energy shift through the Wardrobe yeah

1178
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,940
so

1179
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,219
I walk out on the door turn left to look

1180
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,559
into the other door and as I do the

1181
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:45,598
geyser turns and he's got a little 22 is

1182
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,059
that the like small little woman's guns

1183
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,579
yeah yeah that's what it was it was like

1184
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:52,679
a 22. I know he shot someone point blank

1185
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,359
in the head and never killed him so oh

1186
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,879
my [ __ ] guy because that's what I

1187
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,460
heard it was only a 22. so I've just

1188
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,440
seen that and run for the door now in

1189
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,179
these old Victorian houses they often

1190
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,460
have two doors you know with the little

1191
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:07,440
porch yeah yeah yeah and what the [ __ ]

1192
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,619
I've done is put the latch up so that as

1193
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,780
I go into the door it wouldn't turn

1194
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:14,519
luckily I unlatched it went through the

1195
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,280
first one got through the second one run

1196
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,019
out jumped the gate now it's like three

1197
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,019
o'clock in the afternoon I'm stood

1198
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:24,179
wrapping myself back up into town and

1199
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:26,460
this [ __ ] stood there with the 22 in the

1200
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:28,019
doorway and I'm like bro you better

1201
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,199
[ __ ] make a move because I'm gonna

1202
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:33,900
stop lifting a scene

1203
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:35,639
the three of them run out and now

1204
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,559
we've had people running out of the

1205
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,779
house with a gun bags to read and I've

1206
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,578
got to grow upstairs so now I'm in a

1207
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,140
situation where I'm like [ __ ] I've got

1208
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:46,440
to get all of these plants out of here

1209
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:49,139
so at this point I've got a friend at

1210
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,300
the time who was breeding and had a

1211
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:54,420
little seed company called connoisseur

1212
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,579
genetics oh okay yeah so I hit him up

1213
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,220
and say to him bro if you got somewhere

1214
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:01,440
that you can look after some plants yeah

1215
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:03,059
because I've got these big plants I'm

1216
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,318
about to do a project and I don't want

1217
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,299
to lose all the genetics and I can't

1218
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,699
keep them here so he's like yeah we can

1219
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:12,599
figure something out so

1220
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:15,960
my dad who's like normal working guy no

1221
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,519
not smoke hard just I end up having to

1222
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,240
get him to come and help me we move

1223
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:25,199
[ __ ] 36 big [ __ ] five foot tall

1224
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:29,399
plants in TV boxes on this side yeah the

1225
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:31,919
Mad ones like that yeah and then

1226
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,680
colorful genetics just decided [ __ ] it

1227
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,800
I'm going to pollinate your project and

1228
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:38,699
it just [ __ ] made the seeds with my

1229
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,220
whole

1230
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:43,318
selection with all my plants he just

1231
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:46,098
done the seed line he decided [ __ ]

1232
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:46,099
keeping your things

1233
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,059
for you

1234
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:56,760
how did that work out true so without my

1235
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,920
mind being too blown yeah I'm like

1236
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,960
I might as well come in with you on

1237
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,539
connoisseur genetics and bear it in mind

1238
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,199
that only seized blinds he had ever done

1239
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:08,880
were G13 Haze crosses and the G13 Hayes

1240
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,399
was a male that someone else gave him

1241
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,619
that was Soma's mail yeah so this guy

1242
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,838
didn't know really about no selection he

1243
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,400
was breeding Niche little weird Haze

1244
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,539
things that no one really cared about I

1245
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,079
remember it was like there was like a

1246
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:24,779
purple bastard Haze stuff like that yeah

1247
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:27,839
Titans Haze yeah some like Titanic cross

1248
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:30,359
G13 hey yes yes I remember all those

1249
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,480
weird little niche these things with

1250
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:37,139
weird names there was also like weird

1251
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,358
sssdh G13 Haze yep yep exactly all of

1252
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:43,858
those then all of a sudden

1253
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:47,578
my line drops I come in brand it I get

1254
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:51,719
him distribution we get logos we start

1255
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:53,880
naming things proper like we hit a time

1256
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,379
when things were hot bro like yeah dude

1257
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,079
I don't know what genetics back then

1258
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,579
when we dropped that chembx line with

1259
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,980
the OG chem secret recipe cheese dog

1260
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:08,339
Kenny Jones yeah like there was so much

1261
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:11,039
fire and where we really hit it was that

1262
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:12,960
the people that test for our stuff were

1263
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,599
just Legends of the game now like yeah

1264
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,480
looking back at it the people that test

1265
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,460
roof of Columbus or genetics now I look

1266
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,858
up to because of what they're doing in

1267
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,559
America yeah so it's like those people

1268
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:27,480
inspire me now so it's like I don't know

1269
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,579
how that works huh bro it's nuts because

1270
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,500
I'm telling you these people like are

1271
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,240
doing crazy things and I remember when

1272
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,239
they were doing test Pros for convas or

1273
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:38,159
genetics yeah yeah that that chem line

1274
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,139
hit and that one was just wild bro we

1275
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,818
done so well with that and then we kind

1276
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:44,578
of had to phase into the Femme like

1277
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:46,920
stuff yeah because the market demanded

1278
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:49,619
it that's what it demanded into yeah

1279
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,539
full distribution attitude all of those

1280
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:53,880
kind of things it was like

1281
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:57,719
the regs weren't really doing it no more

1282
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:01,079
we kind of that era phased out and it

1283
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:02,699
was more feminized stuff and like this

1284
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,500
is one thing I'll say yeah because it's

1285
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:07,799
always it's always a contentious issue

1286
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,239
where OJ from connoisseur genetics

1287
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,980
always likes to come out and say like ah

1288
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,078
he never made no seeds during that time

1289
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,039
blah blah blah I'll put my hands up now

1290
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,440
and say

1291
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,358
the first batch of seeds I didn't make

1292
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,880
he made them but it was my mail

1293
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:22,259
selection and my females yeah I never

1294
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,740
made the seeds but I did all the

1295
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,140
selection yeah I then remade a batch of

1296
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:31,739
those seeds myself yeah when it came to

1297
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:35,219
feminized seeds I only ever done two

1298
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:38,399
feminized reversals one was a GDP and

1299
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:40,199
one was Girl Scout cookies the GDP one I

1300
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,519
only did a few little things some of

1301
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:43,318
them got released from connoisseur

1302
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,838
genetics some got released through true

1303
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:48,300
kind of genetics as I broke away onto my

1304
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,920
own yeah because that's what eventually

1305
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,559
happened and that's what happens which

1306
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,680
you have to do yeah because yeah

1307
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,619
connoisseur genetics we uh we were

1308
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:01,618
working together for a year or so and

1309
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:04,440
then we went to go to Amsterdam to enter

1310
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:06,780
the higher times with the chem crosses

1311
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,700
all the Chemex stuff that we've done we

1312
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,940
were ready to go and enter that and we

1313
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:14,639
got busted going to the High Times Jesus

1314
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,519
Christ both of you did yeah both of us

1315
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:20,818
got busted and how did that work

1316
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:24,679
we got busted leaving the country okay

1317
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:27,900
so yeah it's all I'll say on that one is

1318
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:29,960
Jesus there's lip sync ships yeah man

1319
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,579
yeah

1320
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,380
that's it that's the life lesson on that

1321
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:36,839
one guys yeah

1322
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,599
yeah by the end of it we ended up doing

1323
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:41,940
six months in prison [ __ ]

1324
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,760
the six months in prison was just Tigers

1325
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:47,039
like it's all it taught me is that OJ

1326
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,220
like my business partner was like I'm

1327
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,719
not my kind of person yeah when like I

1328
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:53,279
was locked up in a cell with him and it

1329
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:54,899
was just a nightmare oh I was gonna ask

1330
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,900
did you have to spend time with him the

1331
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:00,838
whole time bro it was a nightmare when

1332
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,338
he eventually he we smoked so much the

1333
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:04,318
day that we got sentenced because we

1334
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,299
knew they said to us like yeah you're

1335
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,619
getting banged up you've got an hour

1336
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,539
then come back and they're going to

1337
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:12,200
sentence you so we went and smoked about

1338
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:15,659
10 grand in like five joints

1339
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:18,058
come back in stone to the Bone but three

1340
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:20,639
months into the sentence he got piss

1341
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:23,339
tested and failed

1342
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,379
all three months later three months

1343
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:26,699
later all right and you got shipped out

1344
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,039
and I'll be honest with you it's the

1345
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:31,318
best thing that ever happened the minute

1346
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,239
they [ __ ] him off out of our prison my

1347
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,759
life got easier because it's much better

1348
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:38,039
oh it was much better and when we come

1349
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,020
out of prison I tried for a little while

1350
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:43,259
to like you know when you've been

1351
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:45,059
through so much I was overlooking the

1352
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,400
fact that the guy talks to people like

1353
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:48,660
[ __ ] yeah yeah they've been through a

1354
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,760
traumatic experience with each other

1355
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:54,118
he's just disrespectful to people bro so

1356
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,460
it's like I I was I was like man how can

1357
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:58,380
I break away from this after we've tried

1358
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,480
so much we've been through so much we

1359
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,460
went to prison together we have now

1360
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,559
we've maintained the business while we

1361
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,179
were in prison like we had other people

1362
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,000
making siege for us while we were in

1363
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:10,919
prison we were like on the phone telling

1364
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,719
my dad yeah this is the name for this

1365
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,119
one my dad was getting the seeds

1366
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,858
packaging them taking them like he was

1367
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:21,300
still running a seed come to me from

1368
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:22,199
prison in 2010 and it's like when when I

1369
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,300
came out

1370
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,419
we had to grow together we were going

1371
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,680
for the High Times again yeah and

1372
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,740
basically where it got to the point yeah

1373
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,779
where I was living in a grow house while

1374
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:37,078
on probation yeah

1375
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:39,559
and geysers having a shout in argument

1376
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,519
with me in the house

1377
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:43,200
and I'm like

1378
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,858
I can't put up with this no more because

1379
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:48,719
I'm not yeah I'm like either fight me or

1380
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,219
have an adult conversation but I'm not

1381
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,539
going to scream and shout especially not

1382
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:53,779
when I've got to live here and sleep

1383
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:56,219
here and there's a Grove here

1384
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,680
I don't need this in my life and

1385
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:00,779
literally about three weeks before the

1386
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:03,299
crop was done I spoke to a mutual friend

1387
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,980
and said to them look bro I'm done I'm

1388
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,480
walking away from this will you just

1389
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,519
help him with the last little bit and

1390
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,199
finish all this off and I walked away

1391
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:12,059
from it completely never asked for

1392
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,159
nothing nothing wrong you know what I

1393
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:16,260
try to do yeah I try to salvage a

1394
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,719
friendship I tried to say to him like

1395
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:21,000
look I've lined up someone to come in

1396
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,858
and help I'm not going to do none of the

1397
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,019
same seed projects I'm going to go in a

1398
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:28,139
different direction I'll try to be super

1399
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:30,659
cool about it and still the easel was so

1400
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:33,179
bitter that he still backstabbed me and

1401
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:37,879
done a bunch of snaky things got my own

1402
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:37,879
little cousin to steal genetics from me

1403
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,318
genetics with the genetics that he stole

1404
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:49,140
from me I.E the triangle crucial and the

1405
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,639
Girl Scout cookies wow so he just did

1406
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:52,618
scumbag stuff and it's like when I

1407
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,659
called him out on it he said no honestly

1408
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:57,480
I'd never do that I didn't know he'd

1409
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:59,279
done that I won't do it and then three

1410
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,900
months later my little cousin couldn't

1411
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,220
keep his mouth shut and when telling

1412
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,039
everyone that he got paid the money for

1413
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:09,239
the C project yeah that's how it goes

1414
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:12,358
yeah I mean just a dirt bag but it

1415
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:15,118
spurred me to start true Canada genetics

1416
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:18,539
I went out on my own I ended like I see

1417
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,760
mag again with the TK with my cousin

1418
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:22,679
ended with the turtzilla and yeah the

1419
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,540
year after coming out of prison we got

1420
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:27,480
first and second place at the ISU mag

1421
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:33,779
Club that's awesome what year was that

1422
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:37,400
that was like 2013 I believe Maybe 40.

1423
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:39,540
[ __ ] hey man what a long story

1424
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,318
it's crazy because you know who it was

1425
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:42,960
yeah

1426
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,179
you know you're from that era where High

1427
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,280
Times I know everyone talks [ __ ] about

1428
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:49,139
them everyone says oh the awards are

1429
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,740
bought and all of that yeah yeah I'm

1430
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:55,618
from an era we're winning the High Times

1431
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:58,558
meant something it didn't work for our

1432
00:58:55,619 --> 00:59:01,500
for our era we were all fighting for

1433
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:04,200
third place between us we all kind of

1434
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,318
felt that first and second was for The

1435
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:08,939
Big Spenders yep

1436
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:11,639
that they bought the awards but what I'm

1437
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:14,460
saying is the people that spend a lot of

1438
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:16,259
money have got the best bud a lot of the

1439
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,960
time and the best push and the best

1440
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:22,079
promotion and they put themselves in the

1441
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,298
position to win on a regular basis and

1442
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,700
the smaller companies are fighting for a

1443
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:29,759
third place yeah I mean the way the way

1444
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:31,318
it was and I mean at one point Ariane

1445
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,299
got blocked from going to the club

1446
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,279
because he bragged the judges openly it

1447
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:37,380
was yeah it was it was I mean these

1448
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,000
things happened people would and as I

1449
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,000
explained it even today

1450
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,980
you you pay for events you pay for

1451
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,260
parties for High Times you pay for ad

1452
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,179
then you get the Articles then you get

1453
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,500
this yeah but it's not a one-to-one

1454
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:51,118
exchange like people would think I'm

1455
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,838
gonna buy this cup that's not how it

1456
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,838
works yeah

1457
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:00,119
I never pay for sponsorship or bought

1458
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:01,980
any High Times judges cocaine yeah you

1459
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:04,380
never did because I've heard that those

1460
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,880
two things work favorably well yeah they

1461
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,680
do I've heard I've heard the same thing

1462
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,539
I've never had to do it I've been banned

1463
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,219
the whole time but I I assume that if

1464
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,599
one wanted to do it Coke would be a good

1465
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:15,838
choice

1466
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,338
yeah that's it's it people were fighting

1467
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,078
for third place at every point because

1468
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:21,058
it was either Barney's Farm or

1469
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,280
Greenhouse or Greenhouse or Barney's

1470
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:25,040
farm and that was kind of the dream and

1471
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,540
it's like the year we came out of prison

1472
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,338
I broke away from Columbus or genetics

1473
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:31,318
Cornerstone genetics went and at the

1474
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:33,960
high times I never got to fulfill my

1475
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:37,139
dream I tried the next year

1476
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,818
failed again because I got kicked out of

1477
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:41,039
the house where I had to grow had to

1478
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:43,558
take dry plants to another house to dry

1479
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,960
them yeah yeah then had to send the bud

1480
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:48,059
to Amsterdam and the whole experience

1481
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,740
aggravated me so much that I didn't even

1482
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:52,079
want to enter I was like just

1483
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:53,699
disappointed and I decided you know what

1484
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,740
the only way I'm going to win at High

1485
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:59,039
Times is if I grow the [ __ ] plant in

1486
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:01,500
Amsterdam trim it put it into Tupperware

1487
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,599
walk the Tupperware up to the judge yeah

1488
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,059
and hand it in and that's what I decided

1489
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,160
bro and I moved to Amsterdam I just left

1490
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:10,559
everything left my life got my family

1491
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,179
left everything come moved to Amsterdam

1492
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,280
with the dream of winning the high times

1493
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:17,639
and that was my next mission

1494
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:20,040
well let's talk about that oh bro what a

1495
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:23,279
[ __ ] wild one that was let's go there

1496
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:26,039
dude at the time I just started an extra

1497
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,619
company OCD yeah because we're talking

1498
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:31,679
like around

1499
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:33,660
2012-13 we started OCD Labs we got the

1500
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,699
first across International into Europe

1501
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:37,920
we got it to the UK

1502
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:39,659
without a shadow of a doubt no matter

1503
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,460
what anyone else claims on the scene

1504
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:44,399
because I've heard other claims yeah

1505
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,440
yeah we were the first people to have an

1506
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,798
across International in Europe like

1507
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:53,159
there you go no doubt I got I got

1508
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:55,139
Mortimer says the secret Cup winner she

1509
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:57,719
was a girl called Mortimer says she won

1510
01:01:55,139 --> 01:02:00,779
Secret Cup around 2012 or something like

1511
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:04,199
that I paid for her to come to the UK to

1512
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:06,359
show us single solvent d-waxing oh wow

1513
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,879
so that we were open blasting but we

1514
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:12,000
learned single solventy waxing where you

1515
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,640
would freeze on dry ice fill our Buckner

1516
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,739
funnel all of this so we were so ahead

1517
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:20,098
of the curve and what ended up happening

1518
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:23,098
is when I moved to Amsterdam I took the

1519
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:26,160
oven with me and we started the extract

1520
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,140
company out there so that was the thing

1521
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,358
now we had the extract company run in

1522
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:32,578
and we were kind of building an extract

1523
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:35,219
culture because yeah you couldn't sell

1524
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:37,619
extracts in Amsterdam so what we used to

1525
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:39,118
do is sit in coffee shops dab in and

1526
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,680
then when people pay attention would be

1527
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,539
like you want a dad and then all of a

1528
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:46,199
sudden we'd give them dabs and then that

1529
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:48,539
would spread on and 10 years later about

1530
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:50,939
10 of those people have got businesses

1531
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:53,759
in the industry yeah lives have been

1532
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:56,420
affected wonderfully by being in the

1533
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,640
Cannabis I'm sure and they've got

1534
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:03,380
amazing stories of their own to tell and

1535
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:05,940
wow during that time I

1536
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:08,059
category as you can imagine you start

1537
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,858
grow I was working with a coffee shop

1538
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:14,579
had some nice carts I was getting ready

1539
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:19,078
for the high times I had my turdzilla

1540
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:21,240
car which is a NYC from Soma the ruby

1541
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:22,640
red grapefruit cup across the Granddaddy

1542
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:26,338
Purple

1543
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:28,858
icy mad cup with that cup so I was going

1544
01:03:26,338 --> 01:03:31,679
to enter that into the high times so I

1545
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:34,078
had to grow with the Forum Girl Scout

1546
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:36,659
cookies as well at that time big shout

1547
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:39,000
out to the always be flowering and all

1548
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:41,098
of those guys yeah I did way early on

1549
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,019
I'd get looked after like a king by one

1550
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:44,940
of my I see my friends dude yeah I mean

1551
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:48,298
that is very early for people that don't

1552
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,980
when I come out of prison 2011 I got a

1553
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:52,139
message from

1554
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,639
a certain member of that crew I won't

1555
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:56,239
say his name because obviously he sent

1556
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,618

1557
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:00,779

1563
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,920

1564
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:19,740
bro I'm telling you

1565
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,980
2012 it must have been London ten

1566
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:25,979
thousand a kilo for Girl Scout cookies

1567

Jesus I bet too dude I bet and you could

1568
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,880
move it for that and then the guy who

1569
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:34,399
would move it would double up and make

1570
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:37,380
20. selling it in grams yeah

1571
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,000

01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,440
like 20 one grand

1574
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,059
yeah because people's minds have never

1575
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,639
seen nothing yeah they've never seen

1576
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:49,319
this kind of Bud before because impact

1577
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:52,440
the world differently and that one hit

1578
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:54,838
at a time so yeah we're not which is why

1579
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,700
when I'm now in Amsterdam

1580
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:59,400
have my grow

1581
01:04:56,699 --> 01:05:00,179
everything's vegging beautifully all of

1582
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,200
a sudden

1583
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:05,879
the Bro gets robbed for the genetics in

1584
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:07,699
the Amsterdam of course it did in

1585
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:11,039
Amsterdam of course

1586
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:13,558
they robbed it for the [ __ ] genetics

1587
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,818
they weren't even in flower bro it was

1588
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:17,460
in veg

1589
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:20,759
imagination

1590
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:22,920
it's all very suspect but the next I

1591
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:26,400
wake up you tell me or if there's a

1592
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,680
coincidence yeah yeah yeah you did yeah

1593
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,880
because I go to the grow two times I

1594
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:31,919
used to go to the grow in the morning

1595
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,780
and the evening so it looked like I was

1596
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,519
living there because I was painting a

1597
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:37,079
picture when you live in a place where

1598
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,818
you're not meant to be growing what I

1599
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,380
always used to say to people if you

1600
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:42,298
paint a picture for the surrounding

1601
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,519
people yes their imaginations won't

1602
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:46,679
paint a picture that paints you into a

1603
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,599
corner so exactly an idea if you're

1604
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:52,338
doing normal stuff show them shopping

1605
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:55,140
show them a toolbox show them exactly

1606
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:57,119
play the game don't just be a [ __ ]

1607
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:58,798
idiot about it and get lackadaisy and

1608
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,740
just yeah don't show up in a Corvette

1609
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:03,599
like once a week yeah exactly

1610
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:06,118
so I've played the game properly at this

1611
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:09,059
place going all great

mall area an American woman who lived in

1666

a flat below where the grow was sees me

1667
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:30,420

1676
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,539
grow it so then she goes on to tell me

1677
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:56,759
yeah just so you know it was two

1678
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:59,039
Moroccan guys that robbed the grow I

1679
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:02,039
heard them kick the door off I looked

1680
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:04,140
out and saw them come down with plants

1681
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:06,298
she goes I'm not sure what plants you

1682
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,380

1683
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:09,380
plants that were still in veg

1684
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,560
she goes I obviously called the police

1685
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:21,119
I've got children once that happens I

1686
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,060
can't just leave the grow open like that

1687
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,140
and I didn't have your details anyway I

1688
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,539
just wanted to let you know what the

1689
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:29,400
situation was in future if you're gonna

1690
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:31,140
grow you need to grow in apartments like

1691
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,479
that one over there and she points at

1692
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:36,420
the Block that I'm now living in oh my

1693
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:38,579
god wow so she saw the Moroccan dudes so

1694
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,838
was your business partner did he have to

1695
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:43,460
be Moroccan or have a lot of Moroccan

1696
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,460
connects yeah he's Moroccan

1697
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:52,079
oh Amsterdam bro and you know where it

1698
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,239
was yeah I had told his brother look I

1699
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,679
think I've got broad mites I'm battling

1700
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,659
them at the moment

1701
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,760
with Swarovski Maya and a bunch of other

1702
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:01,859
things if you want to take them you're

1703
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,780
more than welcome to but trust me if you

1704
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:05,399
don't deal with it properly it will ruin

1705
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:07,800
you and everything that comes in touch

1706
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,719
with it and I think that he thought I

1707
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,699
didn't want to give it to him and he

1708
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:13,140
never pursued it further if he would

1709
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:15,419
have said [ __ ] it I'll take the risk

1710
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,800
father said go on take it well I think

1711
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,140
in his head he built up that was

1712
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,260
bullshitting him and then just robbed me

1713
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,520
hopefully he got broad mites too

1714
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:26,719
this is the funny thing

1715
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:30,179
months and months later I saw a picture

1716
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:32,819
posted by someone I put it side by side

1717
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:34,260
to my term Zilla and said to a friend

1718
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:35,759
what does that look like he goes that

1719
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:39,060
one looks like that one but we're broad

1720
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:42,480
mites oh my [ __ ] god

1721
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,860
so who knows but the thing is yeah I

1722
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,479
genuinely don't believe that my business

1723
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:48,420
partner at the time had anything to do

1724
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:51,299
with it I actually think if it was

1725
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:52,800
because I don't know yeah yeah it was

1726
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,900
it was definitely nothing to do with my

1727
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,360
business partner he lost out bigger than

1728
01:10:54,899 --> 01:11:00,299
me he [ __ ] that's true this poor guy

1729
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:02,099
was heartbroken like we we fell out

1730
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,480
because he was just so heartbroken and

1731
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,340
that's why I never held no feeling to

1732
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:07,559
him I'm like I could see he was annoyed

1733
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:10,619
but it's like bro who do we blame like

1734
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,780
yeah he lost out of himself yeah that's

1735
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:14,819
when then I ended the high times with

1736
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:17,399
with like

1737
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:19,559
iron and a few different things and the

1738
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:21,479
truth got me a second place where I was

1739
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,699
shocked this most shocking day of my

1740
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:26,698
life I swear you jumped third and took a

1741
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:28,678
second huh bro I swear to you there as

1742
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:31,019
they announced third

1743
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:34,140
and it went to someone else I looked at

1744
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,340
my cousin and said well we've had fun it

1745
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:38,100
was a good week

1746
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:40,679
and then they named me a second and shot

1747
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,600
just oh I bet yeah total shock because

1748
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:45,000
like I say third place was an

1749
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,780
achievement to get second place was wild

1750
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:52,619
so yeah that meant to me who got first

1751
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:53,460
oh do you know what the biggest trick of

1752
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:56,760
all

1753
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,679
right I swear it's oh even worse yeah

1754
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,360
yeah that's like that with the two of

1755
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:02,100
them

1756
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,279
it really like anybody from our era

1757
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,960
knows that like it was like a dispensary

1758
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,639
that entered with him and they ended

1759
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,260
like Bubba's gift or something like that

1760
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,260
so it's like basically there's in the

1761
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:14,940
Baba kushka yeah congratulations you won

1762

1764
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,980
had to go to Ohio to get his Bubble Kush

1765
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:22,380
cut couldn't even get one in California

1766

1771
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:40,500
Kush was blueberry and swerve was in

1772

1774
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,719
[ __ ] dude so you made it through you

1775
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:51,839
made it through to Amsterdam yeah so

1776
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,219
yeah you got your goal Amsterdam was it

1777
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,380
was like it was a wild period in

1778
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:58,319
Amsterdam because extracts would just

1779
01:12:55,380 --> 01:13:02,219
becoming a thing yeah so we were running

1780
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:05,099
extracts for DNA for Soma for a few

1781
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:06,840
different people Fino finders like there

1782
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,060
was a few different people so it was an

1783
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,400
amazing time to be in Amsterdam to be

1784
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:14,340
growing up culture to be entering

1785
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:18,599
competitions to be dabbing people out

1786
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:21,300
like I I I think no exaggeration I've

1787
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:25,400
probably given

1788
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:27,480
um maybe 500 to a thousand people

1789
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:29,639
conservatively their first ever dad

1790
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,500
that's why um how many people did you

1791
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,300
see white out their first time none

1792
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,800
because I was trying to build a culture

1793
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:40,140
and self-led yeah do you think I never I

1794
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,400
every single person I ever dab do you

1795
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,460
know what they said

1796
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:46,259
what's that I have another

1797
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:49,079
interesting because I always did the

1798
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,840
perfect I'm already thinking low temp

1799
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:53,340
we're already on to that like we were

1800
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,079
trying to get it as enjoyable as

1801
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,699
possible so we didn't want people

1802
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:59,100
coughing we didn't want it to be a bad

1803
01:13:56,698 --> 01:14:01,259
experience everyone's doing stupid [ __ ]

1804
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,960

1812
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:19,079
their first dab because it's just too

1813
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:22,020

1816
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:29,399
mine dude I've done it before I remember

1817
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:32,099
my friends at the time yeah we're in

1818
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:34,439
Amsterdam my friends the previous night

1819
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:36,120
have hung out with Wiz Khalifa and been

1820
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:38,460
smoking and dabbing with Wiz Khalifa

1821
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:40,738
yeah so the next day they're so gassed

1822
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:43,020
up about it we're at uh we're at like

1823
01:14:40,738 --> 01:14:45,718
the Bulldog coffee shop I had done an

1824
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,400
edible earlier we're smoking then all of

1825
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:49,739
a sudden for some reason my friend put

1826
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:51,420
his whole like slab of oil you know like

1827
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:53,639
I'm talking a slap like a cram of wool

1828
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,600
like a rat on the dab bar and I'm

1829
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,219
thinking to myself what's he doing with

1830
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,739
that he goes oh you've got to do a big

1831
01:14:56,219 --> 01:15:00,658
dab like we were doing yesterday myself

1832
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:03,359
you've never done the dad that big in

1833
01:15:00,658 --> 01:15:07,198
your life yeah if you want to give me

1834
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:10,019
your oil to do a big dab like that I'll

1835
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:12,238
do it yeah yeah I've done those kind of

1836
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:16,620
dabs and it's like me I've got an iron

1837
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:19,139
lung me too those ones like the the most

1838
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:22,439
interesting time and the biggest test of

1839
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,960
the iron lung was when Tony vazura and

1840
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:27,539
Bubble Man

1841
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,939
chirps to Amsterdam the first year that

1842
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:32,698
Blue River had terpenes and we were

1843
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:35,219
doing chirp Chasers where they were

1844
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:38,158
dabbing shift and doing a whole drop of

1845
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:41,579
terpenes onto the rig and I'm telling

1846
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:44,539
you that felt like what I imagine a 10

1847
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:47,819
gram rocker crack would feel like

1848
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:50,779
like your whole it cannot be healthy all

1849
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:54,359
right like looking back yeah yeah

1850
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:56,939
a single drip of terpenes onto a dab

1851
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:59,759
cannot be healthy but oh my God it was

1852
01:15:56,939 --> 01:16:01,859
tasty and turkey and I bet it was done

1853
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,020
that without a shadow of a doubt

1854
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:05,519
everyone

1855
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:07,020
cough cough like crazy that was

1856
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,500
something people weren't

1857
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:13,679
cold in on like just crazy potency on

1858
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:16,319
that like the most hardest cat like lock

1859
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,060
onto your chest have you ever I'm sure

1860
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:21,960
you've done whippets before right yeah

1861
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:23,760
have you ever had vanilla flavored gas

1862
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,460
whippets

1863
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,739
I highly recommend never ever doing it

1864
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,380
because what it is it's a special kind

1865
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:34,019
of gas that's vanilla flavored not not

1866
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,880
vanilla liquid added so when you do it

1867
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:37,860
you go to do the whip it you inhale this

1868
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,319
whole other gas and it makes your lungs

1869
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:43,259
just I would imagine that's a lot like

1870
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,639
the terms yeah yeah 100 it's like

1871
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,800
something that should not be in your

1872
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,900
lungs and could probably kill you if you

1873
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,699
inhale it because it's not oxygen and

1874
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:52,379
it's just not enough everything else

1875
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:53,579
there it could it could jack you up

1876
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,159
pretty hard

1877
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:58,319
yeah it was it was such a fun time like

1878
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:00,960
in Amsterdam because we saw during that

1879
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,899
period there was like it was during the

1880
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,698
transition where BHO was crazy and then

1881
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,679
all of a sudden rosin got discovered

1882
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:11,279
during that era yeah yeah

1883
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,679
so all of a sudden rosin era came in and

1884
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,840
then what ended up happening with me is

1885
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:19,260
as I won the high times at the end of

1886
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:22,319
2014 yeah I then went on a trip to

1887
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:24,539
Morocco on a reconnaissance mission uh

1888
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:26,939
because the people of Morocco were

1889
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,399
curious I'm sure it's left on the

1890
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:31,079
material after all the hair should come

1891
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:33,359
up

1892
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:36,658
oh interesting because imagine if you

1893
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:39,059
have five ton of material yeah all of a

1894
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:41,219
sudden there's seven percent

1895
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:42,360
oil on it the ho

1896
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:43,920
yeah

1897
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:46,079
because that's what it ended up being

1898
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,119
there were two different strains that I

1899
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,738
tested one of them was giving four

1900
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:51,960
percent and the other one was given

1901
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:54,658
seven percent yeah so you could get

1902
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:57,179
seven percent oil return off of the

1903
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:59,698
plant material that they were making in

1904
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:04,140
Morocco interesting they were looking at

1905
01:17:59,698 --> 01:18:05,819
different methods of like in Morocco one

1906
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:07,560
of the issues that they have to have

1907
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:09,658
this thing is dry it and then wait for

1908
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:12,480
things to get cold so that they can then

1909
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:14,698
process it yeah so one of the evolutions

1910
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,559
that come into Morocco is to get a

1911
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:19,198
generator to air condition and

1912
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:23,400
refrigerate the room where you work yeah

1913
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:25,799
so now you can process your whole crop

1914
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:28,139
make your money then go to your neighbor

1915
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:31,320
offer them a fraction of what they call

1916
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:34,020
their crops Worth to take off of them a

1917
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:36,299
month or two early so now they've got no

1918
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:38,340
work to do they get paid early and you

1919
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,739
take it to your facility and you process

1920
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,779
it and put it out and that's much better

1921
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:44,879
quality yeah and that was one of the

1922
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:46,800
evolutions you start to notice like all

1923
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,539
these different Evolutions the first one

1924
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,000
obviously was the feminized seeds in

1925
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:52,019
Morocco yeah yeah where yeah what would

1926
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,920
happen is

1927
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:57,540
one farmer would grow feminized seeds

1928
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,880
and then what would happen is the

1929
01:18:57,539 --> 01:19:01,979
neighboring farm would see the quality

1930
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,679
of that crop and they would be

1931
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:07,859
interested and that would happen is this

1932
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:12,000
farmer who had paid say a euro per seed

1933
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:13,679
for femini seeds they would sell all of

1934
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,880
their material

1935
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:21,119
to the other farmer who would now get

1936
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:23,640
Moroccan hybrid Dutch genetic yeah seeds

1937
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,738
they just take the plant material throw

1938
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,539
it down like they normally would but

1939
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:30,059
what it would mean is that their crop

1940
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:31,979
would be such a percentage more than

1941
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,840
next year that they got enough money

1942
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:36,238
that the following year they bought

1943
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:39,360
feminine seeds God yeah that makes sense

1944
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:41,339
and they've passed on to the next farms

1945
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,559
and it was spread and people were

1946
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:47,579
getting a little bit more yield by

1947
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:49,679
getting hybrid regular seeds yes and

1948
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:52,619
once they put the cash influx from that

1949
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:55,079
regular seed hybrids they would then

1950
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:56,880
invest with the extra money and feminis

1951
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:58,979
and that was how it spread and everyone

1952
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,640
began to grow feminized feminists and

1953
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:04,939
that's how DNA took over Morocco

1954
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:07,500
DNA the Spanish Brands like yeah

1955
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:09,479
Greenhouse like a lot of let's be honest

1956
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:12,658
a lot of the the first time I remember

1957
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:15,119
it happening I I'll give you my theory

1958
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:16,920
you tell me sure sure the first hash

1959
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,679
that I remember coming back from Morocco

1960
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,779
that was named was chem dog hash and

1961
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,640
that was when Greenhouse tried to do a

1962
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:25,738
chemdog seed line and it was I remember

1963
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:27,119
that so they couldn't sell the seeds so

1964
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,399
what happened to the seeds it went to

1965
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,800
Morocco and they made hash out a bit and

1966
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:34,259
that was this that was the real start of

1967
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,380
it it was feminized seeds

1968
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:40,739
that couldn't be sold on the regular

1969
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:44,579
market and they then decided to sell

1970
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:46,678
them to Morocco and that was the true

1971
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:49,198
beginning of the Moroccans buying

1972
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:50,819
feminized seeds wow so why why weren't

1973
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:52,559
they able to sell it why were they able

1974
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:54,658
to sell the chem dog

1975
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,360
because it was just her I think whatever

1976
01:20:54,658 --> 01:20:59,279
come with the chemdog like it was just

1977
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:00,960
such a home line they weren't able to

1978
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,579
release the scenes that makes sense

1979
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,739
there's a few other ones that are kind

1980
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:06,119
of were out at that time and you kind of

1981
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:08,158
noticed that that was what the hash was

1982
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:09,599
that was coming from Europa and that

1983
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:11,759
makes sense people have done over the

1984
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,760
years is given the stuff that didn't do

1985
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,079
well went to Morocco but now people are

1986
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,539
a little bit more fussy with what they

1987
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:20,158
want I'm sure now yeah but they're just

1988
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:22,380
probably finding the new Morocco right

1989
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:23,939
now I mean Thailand or wherever you know

1990
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:25,619
what I mean it's been a weird Evolution

1991
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:27,539
from Morocco because they kind of like

1992
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:29,158
they got too carried away they had some

1993
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:30,960
good hashmaking strains and they thought

1994
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:32,339
everything that's new is going to be

1995
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,158
good

1996
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:37,560
that's how it goes

1997
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:39,899
Broadway not all resin is equal and it's

1998
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,699
good for dry sift yeah metal resin has a

1999
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:43,859
bunch of oil in it I was about to say

2000
01:21:41,698 --> 01:21:45,539
that's the problem bro is that what's

2001
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:47,698
happened over the last few years being

2002
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:49,679
in Spain Barcelona now you see a lot of

2003
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:52,079
it is that you'll get the blocks of hash

2004
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,119
from Morocco they've been back sealed

2005
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,119
and where they haven't been able to dry

2006
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:59,099
the plants properly and the resin is a

2007
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,679
greasy type of resin that has more water

2008
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:04,020
content than the Sandy type of resin

2009
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,699
that is traditionally used yeah when you

2010
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:07,860
then vaccine it and it's left for amount

2011
01:22:05,698 --> 01:22:09,839
of time it ferments the whole thing just

2012
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:12,359
Falls up and when you open the Block

2013
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,819
it's just rotten and it's just gone off

2014
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:17,819
it's like fermented so that fermented

2015
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:19,559
house is brutal too yeah so this is one

2016
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:22,079
of the things they're offering to now be

2017
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,420
a lot more selective with what genetics

2018
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,539
they take to Morocco rather than just

2019
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:29,219
thinking oh

2020
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:31,319
it's got a z in it everyone will want it

2021
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:33,658
unless yeah and then all of a sudden

2022
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:36,119
it's greasiest spot they can't get it

2023
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:38,819
off the plant they beat it get [ __ ]

2024
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,579
[ __ ] and just have a bunch of greasy

2025
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:44,579
moldy hash when it arrives at this oh

2026
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:46,439
Lord yeah not all resin is equal for

2027
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:48,359
each environment and each extraction

2028
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:49,639
method that's for damn sure

2029
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:53,339
well

2030
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:54,900
so we get to Morocco with you what's the

2031
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:57,659
next step what's the next step in your

2032
01:22:54,899 --> 01:23:01,079
Evolution to where you're at now it was

2033
01:22:57,658 --> 01:23:03,359
then to go to Spain because Amsterdam as

2034
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:06,359
much as I love Amsterdam

2035
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,279
the culture there to grow is just it

2036
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:10,139
doesn't exist they're like so suspicious

2037
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:11,939
your neighbor will knock on your door

2038
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:14,460
when you arrive and ask you who you are

2039
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:16,259
and what you do Jesus they're the most

2040
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,359
invasive people I've ever known in my

2041
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:20,219
life yeah I couldn't live with that look

2042
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:22,380
the only reason I got away with growing

2043
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:24,719
in the place that I did is because my

2044
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:27,779
landlord was from Iran and he was like

2045
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:30,300
this beautiful Iranian guy that left in

2046
01:23:27,779 --> 01:23:32,519
the like conflict in the 80s he like

2047
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,340
wrote to the border on the motorbike

2048
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,440
from his parents being shot at him and

2049
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:41,340
had bullet holes where he got shot

2050
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:44,039
fleeing Iran described but he loved me

2051
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:46,260
bro he was so nice at one point we had

2052
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:48,600
the vacuum oven in the in the downstairs

2053
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:50,280
kitchen and what we didn't realize is

2054
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:53,420
when you turn the light on it was put in

2055
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:53,420
a little extraction fan on

2056
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:02,239
were going into the extraction fan and

2057
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:04,380
going through every apartment

2058
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:05,819
where we come to us and goes look

2059
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:07,260
whatever you're doing don't do it in the

2060
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:09,420
front of the house because it's good I'm

2061
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:11,940
getting complaints from the neighbors oh

2062
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:14,840
my God bro you could have like just

2063
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:17,279
kicked me out because he's a problem

2064
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,020
if you let someone grow in your house

2065
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,119
they'll take your house from you yeah

2066
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:24,179
they yeah it's that way yeah brutal out

2067
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:27,840
there don't [ __ ] around so yeah you took

2068
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:30,179
big risks and after after the Morocco

2069
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,880
trip it was literally a point of going

2070
01:24:30,179 --> 01:24:34,800
to

2071
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:38,039
Barcelona I had a bunch of opportunities

2072
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,739
that all fell apart like I was I was in

2073
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:42,960
I was invited here I already had plans

2074
01:24:40,738 --> 01:24:44,879
to come to Barcelona but I got invited

2075
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,520
on a whole bunch of promises on projects

2076
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,260
and once I got here that all fell apart

2077
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,300
and I ended up having to salvage things

2078
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:54,060
on my own so it was quite an adventure

2079
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:56,699
but getting to Barcelona

2080
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:58,560
getting set up here and being a part of

2081
01:24:56,698 --> 01:25:01,259
the culture it was like

2082
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,500
the moment I had a smuggling conviction

2083
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:06,300
and I couldn't be in America I needed to

2084
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:09,658
be in the next best place for the

2085
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:12,539
culture yeah or who I am and for what I

2086
01:25:09,658 --> 01:25:16,559
want to do with my life and Spain and

2087
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:18,179
Barcelona for Europe it's the it's at

2088
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,420
this point that epicent or of the

2089
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:23,640
Cannabis culture yeah industry so for me

2090

2091
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:28,199
what led me here I envy it bro that's

2092
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:30,359
that's like my Mecca to make it to Spain

2093
01:25:28,198 --> 01:25:32,339

do you know what bro it's like it's like

2095
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:37,199
anywhere it has its ups and downs but

2096
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:39,719
the pace of Life is Beautiful like

people are just so blase my next door

2098
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:44,219
neighbors like on one side I've got

2099
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,920
neighbors that are a family that grow

2100
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:48,480
they grow like there's like the mum and

2101
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,859
dad are probably a little bit younger

2102
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,379

2104
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,719
to in their 20s they've got to grow

2105
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:59,879
underneath their house like they grow in

2106
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:02,698
their back Garden on the other side I've

2107
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,920
got an album one year the elderly couple

2108
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:08,039
all my plants were blown over in a storm

2109
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,319
the old man who must be 70 odd called me

2110
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:14,460
over he saw me standing there like this

2111
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:17,460
and he goes Daddy Daddy come calls me

2112
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:21,079
over he's got these big like eight foot

2113
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:24,420
cast iron steaks ask me how many I need

2114
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:27,920
ah 12 of these cast iron steaks I was

2115
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:30,359
able to stake up all my plants

2116
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,399
amazing there was no solution other than

2117
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:35,639
that so yeah yeah yeah imagine that a

2118
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,799
culture where it's so it's addicted like

2119
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:41,159
when you go to a grow shop out here just

2120
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:43,920
a normal like yeah place like uh like

2121
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:46,138
Hardware God yeah yeah on one of the

2122
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,760
aisles you'll see some plant food cheap

2123
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:50,659
shitty plant food but with cannabis

2124
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,659
leaves four cannabis

2125
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:56,579
yeah yeah when they see me growing a few

2126
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,619
plants the lady she's complimented me on

2127
01:26:56,579 --> 01:27:00,119
my plants before she's like oh your

2128
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:01,679
plants are looking lovely this year like

2129
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:03,899
I felt so awkward I'm like oh I've got

2130
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,880
melons too and I want to know other

2131
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:08,238
stuff I'm like I'm not it's not just

2132
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,239
Danger

2133
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:12,238
that's [ __ ] wild though like in

2134
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,679
California we still don't even have that

2135
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:16,019
kind of attitude here like where

2136
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,880
neighbors are okay like I have neighbors

2137
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:21,320
where I'm just like every day I'm just

2138
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,319
waiting you know like

2139
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:28,440
I could have been anywhere next to

2140
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:30,600
anyone to land in between two neighbors

2141
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:32,158
one that are just gardeners that just

2142
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:34,620
Farm their house they only come on

2143
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:37,619
weekends they love me they put baskets

2144
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:38,899
of fruit on the fence like peaches off

2145
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:41,158
their trees

2146
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:43,019
it would just share back and forth I

2147
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:44,939
just give them yeah what they give me

2148
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,920
and the same from the other people so

2149
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:50,638
it's like it's a beautiful place out

2150
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:52,980
here and the culture's amazing we have a

2151
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,980
a cannabis Social Club scenes beautiful

2152
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:57,479
it's it's not quite lived up to some of

2153
01:27:55,979 --> 01:28:00,000
my expectations there's a lot of things

2154
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:02,399
that I don't like about it like

2155
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,198
this same probably review bro a lot of

2156
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,079
the way the scenes dictated these days

2157
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,178
doesn't Vibe with me like yeah one of

2158
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:11,579
the things that I'll say here do you

2159
01:28:09,179 --> 01:28:14,039
remember the times when Growers decided

2160
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:17,158
what smokers smoked and what we grew

2161
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:19,679
yeah yeah yeah I do it's not that way

2162
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:22,859
now I get people that hit me up and they

2163
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:24,779
want my stuff like cert they want Niche

2164
01:28:22,859 --> 01:28:27,179
things from me but then they say to me

2165
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:29,460
like if you've got something with any

2166
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:31,859
hype in it because I've got to sell a

2167
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:35,100
couple Bits And if you ain't got a name

2168
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:37,259
that people yeah or something in here

2169
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:40,020
I'm gonna struggle moving here and it's

2170
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:41,760
like oh I could I used to be able to

2171
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,320
take someone something and I didn't even

2172
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,659
need to give it a name I could just know

2173
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:47,399
this this this and this people just take

2174
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:50,158
my word because they knew that I'm

2175
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:52,079
growing fire you'd get variety you'd

2176
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,420
like some things more than others like

2177
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:55,679
and that's how you found amazing things

2178
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:59,179
now

2179
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:02,039
the way things are marketed the things

2180
01:28:59,179 --> 01:29:04,500
the beautiful things that are overlooked

2181
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:07,019
like it's so walk like I'll give you an

2182
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:09,779
example I had a friend that grews a

2183
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:13,139
beautiful uh Pure Michigan which is like

2184
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:16,079
a it's an oreo Oreos something yeah so

2185
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:17,880
anyone that knows Oreos I've I've had

2186
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:20,939
the Oreos part I've bred with it

2187
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:23,579
beautiful cup but bland most of the time

2188
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:25,259
yeah even grown well Bland but super

2189
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:27,600
great breeding cup

2190
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:31,079
great reading a lot of potential yeah

2191
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:34,139
the the Pure Michigan that he done was

2192
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:37,198
amazing smoke wires Leaps and Bounds

2193
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:38,760
above the Oreos this is what turned me

2194
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:40,979
on to what a good breeding plant it was

2195
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:43,440
yeah so you take some of the Pure

2196
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:45,899
Michigan to a club in Barcelona it sits

2197
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:48,839
on the menu for weeks they change it to

2198
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:49,979
Oreos and it sells out instantly yeah

2199
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,560
stupid

2200
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:54,419
and it's like

2201
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,100
I don't know how to get my head around

2202
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,739
that sometimes and that's the way things

2203
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:00,840
are sadly like some of the market and

2204
01:29:58,738 --> 01:30:03,000
over here people are so caught up in the

2205
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,579
Milo bags and most of the milers aren't

2206
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,399
even real so that's what I hear mylar

2207
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:10,619
mylar Milo over there for my buddy in

2208
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,539
Austria he's talking about how like the

2209
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:15,619
seed packs over there have like mylars

2210
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:18,420
like this big and it's how big your eyes

2211
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:19,920
I think it's something to do with this I

2212
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,960
think that people are fed up with

2213
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,899
feeling like criminals and the minute

2214
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,480
you get something in a fancy bag that's

2215
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:29,939
branded a market it's all part of the

2216
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:32,158
feeling of feeling normal of feeling

2217
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:34,500
like a normal consumer buying a normal

2218
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:37,500
consumer product not feeling like a

2219
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:39,479
criminal buying a criminal a drug you

2220
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:42,179
know what I mean and I think that's what

2221
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:44,939
people tap into and I think that's where

2222
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:47,699
it it comes from but we need to kind of

2223
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:51,539
breed some kind of more like educated

2224
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:52,859
consumer going forward is I mean and

2225
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:55,380
it's a good time to talk about this you

2226
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:57,359
have your podcast right yep you're

2227
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:59,699

2228
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:02,099
great job over there you know and in

2229
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:04,379
Europe we have to have just as much

01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,940
education as we we do over here

2231
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:08,100

01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:39,420
people opportunities and people use me

2249
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:41,099
as a stepping stone to First themselves

2250
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:43,139
and I've been through that roller

2251
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,960
coaster over the last year or so and

2252
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:49,380
it's kind of left me pouring into other

2253
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,880
people's cup and not into my own and one

2254
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,920
of the things I have missed is the

2255
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,199
podcast because like you say it does

2256
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:58,139
give people that kind of Outlet

2257
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:00,059
information I love getting people on and

2258
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:04,139
giving people the insight into the

2259
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:05,699
European scene yeah or a kind of flavors

2260
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:08,100
people are hunting here what kind of

2261
01:32:05,698 --> 01:32:10,379
genetics people are favoring what old

2262
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:12,960
school stuff is being found and coming

2263
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:15,659
out of the woodwork what's being revived

2264
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:18,480
what can you miss trying to piece

2265
01:32:15,658 --> 01:32:20,638
together some history so I'm slowly

2266
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,859
getting back into it I started to write

2267
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,480
like a little uh list of different

2268
01:32:22,859 --> 01:32:26,399
people that I want to try and get on for

2269
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,959
episodes and start getting things

2270
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,539
together so I'm definitely going to be

2271
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,340
doing that and getting important

2272
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:35,158
it's important to have the dudes that

2273
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:37,380
know their [ __ ] doing it so like I I

2274
01:32:35,158 --> 01:32:39,539
think every chance you get to do it it's

2275
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:41,159
it's a plus to the whole community and I

2276
01:32:39,539 --> 01:32:44,100
think being able to hear in America

2277
01:32:41,158 --> 01:32:46,439
about you is even better honestly agree

2278
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:48,300
to Syndicate I love it so much you know

2279
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:50,698

2283
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:58,859

2284
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:01,199
kind of conversations that we have where

2285

we should what we do we need to do like

2308
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,079
one where we just talk about what I'm

2309
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:54,540
working with genetics and we're talking

2310
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:57,300
about actually my work and then we need

2311
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:59,519
to do that Forum round table I'm

2312

so you can talk about some res dogs

2314

stories like what

2315
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,719
I wonder that yeah yeah one of the ones

2316
01:34:10,738 --> 01:34:15,000
that always gets confusing is the East

2317
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:18,600
Coast salvadiso yeah and I'll give you a

2318
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,279
reason why do you remember a point when

2319
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:22,139
there was a TR I don't know if you

2320
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:24,059
remember there was a big drama on icy

2321
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:26,639
mag where it was like a dude called

2322
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,440
friendly friend it's like how more

2323
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,020
suspicious a name have you got to have I

2324
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:33,779
know friendly friend yeah right

2325
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:37,320
um res for the East Coast Sour Diesel

2326
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:39,779
cup and kind of like used it on a bunch

2327
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:42,059
of weird projects and caused a whole

2328
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:45,719
bunch of drama and like I remember that

2329
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:47,880
it was yeah it was crazy bro so like res

2330
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:50,698
didn't like to give out no cuts to no

2331
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:53,400
one and what he done is he passed out

2332
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:56,879
the East Coast Sour Diesel cut to Sun

2333
01:34:53,399 --> 01:35:00,238
simulator yeah yeah and it wasn't it was

2334
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:02,060
a bx2 and that's the kind of [ __ ] that

2335
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:04,799
muddied the water because imagine

2336
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:07,739
everyone who knew

2337
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:10,380
res said yeah I gave him the cup yeah

2338
01:35:07,738 --> 01:35:12,539
we've got the cup but secretly behind

2339
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,460
the scenes he told me yeah and uh that

2340
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,779
was the that was the bx2 that he smoked

2341
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:18,658
last time I didn't give him the real cut

2342
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:20,939
so it's like that's how that's how

2343
01:35:18,658 --> 01:35:22,319
quickly everything gets twisted and no

2344
01:35:20,939 --> 01:35:24,779
one knows what's the real cut anymore

2345
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:26,219
and that's how that's how greedy it is

2346
01:35:24,779 --> 01:35:28,139
too because like he knows he's gonna

2347
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:29,939
[ __ ] up all kinds of you know like

2348
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:31,560
people's provenance down the road what

2349
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:33,479
people think they have and it's all

2350
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:36,179
about greed in his mind it's not about

2351
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:38,039
furthering the the genetics making sure

2352
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:39,840
shit's right it's about greed in his

2353
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:41,519
pocket [ __ ] like that and that's why I

2354
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,440
never got along with the dude like never

2355
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:46,500
ever

2356
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:49,919
welcome yeah that's it all right brother

2357
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:51,539
I think that's a reason we're hour and a

2358
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,800
half in I don't think it's gonna take

2359
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:56,719
much editing at all dude nailed it dude
