um NLS uh yeah a little bit and and uh

29
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,899
you know how things survive from now to

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,820
then you know we could talk about

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,439
um you know we can we're we were

32
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,000
thinking that we we actually opened it

33
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,039
up to some suggestions and there were

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,340
some things about some strains That Got

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,100
Away there was actually some pretty good

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,960
uh questions that came in so

37
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,919
um we're gonna try to tackle some of

38
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,798
those

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,038
you know uh you know throughout

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,080
throughout the thing and then you know

41
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,318
um one thing that maybe I should start

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,379
with is that uh you know we chatted

43
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,299
about some cam history some chem 101 and

44
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:21,780
stuff like that and you know whenever

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,719
you whenever you tackle like uh sort of

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,419
a big and famous weed history segment

47
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,878
right you're gonna get a lot of debate

48
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,979
right yeah uh which is good I like

49
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,479
master debaters you know and you want

50
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,039
different people to be able to

51
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,259
contribute and you want people to come

52
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,759
up and say things but then you're always

53
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,378
going to get people that are that are

54
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,318
going to pick apart one section that

55
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:46,079
they feel is incorrect or what often

56
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,659
happens and uh CSI and I were actually

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,000
talking about this last night is that

58
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,539
you know on some level when you want to

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,860
figure out the history it's like which

60
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,620
semi-untrustworthy person do you lean

61
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,060
more towards yeah right and there's

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,439
there's an aspect of that where it's

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,598
like it's very difficult to have a

64
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,598
situation where you feel like one person

65
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,759
is totally Angelic and honest in every

66
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,119
facet and this is how it is and there's

67
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,919
not debate so yeah debate is good

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,680
you know

69
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,299
um this guy just said he met Don the

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,780
Indian recently he's been dead for a

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,760
while so but you don't have to do that

72
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,818
there's an aspect to it where it was

73
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,299
like you anytime there's anybody famous

74
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:32,339
or even semi-famous uh especially if if

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,140
it's it's it's hard to like determine

76
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,878
who they are you're always going to get

77
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,359
there's not just fake cuts there's fake

78
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,878
people oh yeah right the second DJ Short

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,099
you know yeah there's there's you know

80
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,139
in any kind of famous lineage there'll

81
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,179
be like an accepted Story and there's

82
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,518
one or two guys in the corner screaming

83
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,360
that it's [ __ ] and it all came from

84
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,158
me or whoever you know and so what you

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,840
try to do is you try to like you try to

86
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,959
like corroborate information from

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,060
different people and you try to see you

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,098
know and uh you know there's there was

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,979
an aspect to it too because

90
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,679
one of the aspects about chemfam for

91
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,780
instance is that uh you know a lot of

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,879
the most outspoken people when it comes

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,858
to kem's story

94
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,199
um didn't have all that that much to do

95
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,579
with it yeah you know and then so you

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,680
get some people out of the woodwork and

97
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,060
stuff like that and you get and you know

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,379
and you try to tell a story and of

99
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,879
course there's there's parts and people

100
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,399
are going to remember things differently

101
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,860
and that's not really the that's not

102
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,439
really the the that's not really an

103
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,240
issue right because it's all about like

104
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,639
that's what like science right science

105
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,939
is right until it's wrong yeah and then

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,160
it adjusts itself to the new reality so

107
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,360
like when you're doing history it's not

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,120
so much that you're wrong or you're

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,800
lying if you get a part mistaken it's

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,939
that you might need more Nuance so you

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,860
might have there might be some stuff

112
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,360
that you don't say because you think

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,040
it's too out there

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,660
yeah

115
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,979
it's not corroborated enough you know

116
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,960
and

117
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:03,418
um and you know and how do you do that

118
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,519
and so like part of the part of the

119
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,740
thing we're trying to do with with most

120
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,560
of this stuff is that we actually don't

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,139
have a personal tie to any kind of like

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,000
big profit motive behind it yeah you

123
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,620
know I don't have some like secret chem

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,839
line that's all about to be released or

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,540
anything like that like there's an

126
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,339
aspect of history for history's sake

127
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,900
um you know history is mostly in

128
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,339
cannabis right now especially it's

129
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,739
mostly oral

130
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,839
yeah it's not written down yeah it's

131
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,240
held by different people they often

132
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,179
disagree they were often Young when the

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,740
history was being made and uh they often

134
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,600
didn't know it was history

135
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,740
yeah like there's a bunch of people out

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
there that were doing what all the

137
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,360
famous kids were doing back then uh that

138
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
don't remember what they did either but

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,379
it doesn't matter because nobody cares

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,340
to ask them yeah yeah that's been a big

141
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,259
part of it

142
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,478
you know

143
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,919
um you know and so and so you know

144
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,079
there's I just want everyone to know

145
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,758
that like it's it's not like when we

146
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,899
talk about stuff there's not it's it

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,639
definitely doesn't have to be

148
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,159
necessarily definitive it's always open

149
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,319
for debate we're always open for new

150
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,960
information and stuff like that and

151
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,939
sometimes a lot of times What CSI and

152
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,159
Matt and I and others do is we try to

153
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,899
match the story to what the plant tells

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,759
us yeah

155
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,399
you know there's a story where it's like

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,780
plants don't lie yeah

157
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,079
kind of thing

158
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,279
right so you know

159
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,038
um so I just wanted to get that out

160
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,679
there first because you know there's uh

161
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,719
Instagram and and uh that's part of the

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,400
reason why like these lives are cool is

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,919
because Instagram is actually like a

164
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,839
really bad place to debate anything yes

165
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,339
it is the comments are super short at

166
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,799
least on the forums you could get out

167
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,060
some paragraphs or something yeah you

168
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,160
know and you could actually have a

169
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,620
little bit more long-form debate and

170
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,180
Instagram is like a paragraph or less of

171
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,300
basically like you know [ __ ] you you're

172
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,800
a dick yeah doesn't match my money

173
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,120
motive yeah that doesn't that doesn't

174
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,620
match that you must have someone else

175
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,180
and then most people think that you

176
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,259
would act like how they would act too so

177
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,459
it's kind of yeah um you know it it and

178
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,860
you know the other part of it that's

179
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,779
funny too is it's like you

180
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,000
um you have an aspect too where it's

181
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,799
like and Matt and I talk about this all

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,418
the time where the claims of what people

183
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,639
have doesn't matter what family you're

184
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,439
talking about they get earlier and

185
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,139
earlier

186
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,139
until they're they actually predate the

187
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,379
story yeah and that's common too and

188
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,000
almost every famous Weed family yeah it

189
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,800
like it gets earlier and earlier and

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,079
people get access sooner and sooner

191
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,759
until the generally the person that's

192
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,139
generally accepted to start it there's

193
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
someone else that has it four or five

194
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,060
years before that person yeah yeah

195
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,038
you know and and so that kind of stuff

196
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,259
skunk one

197
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,459
that kind of stuff is is tough you know

198
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,840
so I just we're not going to talk about

199
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,698
that all the time I just thought I just

200
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,859
wanted to throw it out there in the

201
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,900
sense that like we definitely are open

202
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,699
for a debate this is actually kind of

203
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,560
like these chats are kind of like

204
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,840
conversation starters

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,939
yeah you know and we're trying to get

206
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,839
information out there so that history

207
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,839
gets debated

208
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:14,579
um you know and whatnot you know so

209
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,799
um yeah we call it pre-pre that pray

210
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,659
pray that pre-pre and and the and kind

211
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,220
of the way cannabis is is because you

212
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,259
don't get taught by your parents mostly

213
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,599
or this or that you come into cannabis

214
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,699
when you come into it there can be stuff

215
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,500
that's like extremely common knowledge

216
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,780
10 years ago that becomes rare info

217
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,080
today yeah

218
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,538
you know so I mean I I just we don't

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,639
need to spend a ton of time on it but

220
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,439
um but there is there's a bunch of that

221
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,559
and you can see it all the time there's

222
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,899
blueberry before DJ had blueberry yeah

223
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,458
there's blueberry there's blueberry from

224
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,379
Alaska that has nothing to do with that

225
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:53,518
there's you know there's people that

226
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:54,899
have Kush way early yeah you know uh in

227
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,700
different states there's people that

228
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,200
can't it's so it's all and it's like you

229
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,000
don't want to call people Liars or

230
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,040
mistaken and in some cases they might be

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,539
lying but in some cases they might just

232
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,679
be telling a story that they were told

233
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:11,879
yeah all right in some cases they have

234
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,259
Hawaiian OG and 70s yeah cannabis

235
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,059
folklore is a good way to put it there's

236
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,980
a lot of folklore there's a lot of

237
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,778
Legends there might be kernels of truth

238
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,100
of the Legends and that's not even

239
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:21,778
saying that everything that I say is

240
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,480
absolutely true like there could be

241
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:27,360
aspects of it where you're mistaken you

242
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,278
know and we tried Matt and I to to like

243
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,039
delineate like when we went from what we

244
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,439
think of as like actual fact

245
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,319
to like now we're kind of like making

246
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,899
educated guesses yeah speculation versus

247
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,200
speculations yeah you know

248
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,879
and um and so on and so forth so

249
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,879
I just wanted to get that out there that

250
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:51,059
this is definitely a sort of a venue to

251
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,458
start debate yeah and to try to get some

252
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,619
facts to debate about so you can you can

253
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:58,859
reach out to either one of us

254
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,659
here on Discord or wherever uh if you

255
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,519
want to keep it going or it Sparks your

256
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,100
memory or anything like that just wanted

257
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,200
to put that out there

258
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,420
uh but someone asked about the Maui dog

259
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,720
I can talk about that super quick just

260
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,879
because Maui dog is supposedly a bag

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,300
seed that came out of a bag of dog Bud

262
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,159
that was bought in Sonoma County uh

263
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:24,179
right around the turn of the century 99

264
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:27,000
2000 ish and they took it to Maui and

265
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:29,879
they creatively named the S1 or whatever

266
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,799
it was that came out of that seed Maui

267
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,860
dog

268
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,899
right it's also confusing because I made

269
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,120
super dog crosses with this other cut

270
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,860
called the Maui and those things got

271
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,139
used and mandelbrot's work and other

272
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,700
work and that's also called

273
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,120
um you know Maui super dog and other

274
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,060
stuff like that so but that's all it is

275
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,019
it's just a bag seed from supposed chem

276
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:58,500
91 bought around 99 2000 and then they

277
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,360
popped the seed on Maui and then they

278
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,399
crossed someone crossed that to some

279
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
skunk on Maui and that became the skunk

280
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,419
dog

281
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,519
I think it was Molokai Frost was what

282
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,159
Grace Paul said something on something

283
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:15,899
along those lines you know some kind of

284
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:18,838
Hawaiian skunk yeah you know so

285
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,519
um anyway you know that's kind of that's

286
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,820
kind of it and like there's other topics

287
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,379
that we're gonna cover in the future

288
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,480
that are probably going to create even

289
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,820
more debate than that

290
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,320
yeah I would think so and there's and

291
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,879
anytime you get into a debate about

292
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,620
something where people have the real cut

293
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,360
or they're selling seeds of this or they

294
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,639
have their reputation staked on anything

295
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,980
they only want to talk about stuff that

296
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,899
makes them look better yeah it's the

297
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,060
rare person that wants to discuss actual

298
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,339
history most people in cannabis history

299
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,099
are interested in like burnishing their

300
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,160
own Legend yes and so we're trying to do

301
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,079
a little something different where you

302
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,778
know we're not completely just polishing

303
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,659
ourselves the entire episode yeah and

304
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:04,019
for for future reference I I don't have

305
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:06,360
any tied a chem because I once said that

306
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,159
earlier that I was trying to burnish my

307
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,379
reputation with Kim I don't have any

308
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,879
ties to cam none you we're going to talk

309
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,159
about a bunch of stuff that we don't I

310
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,539
mean my my personal tie to chem has

311
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,639
nothing to do with the creation of any

312
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:20,099
of the Famous Cuts yeah it just so

313
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,439
happens I became uh best friends with

314
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,019
the guy that brought them West yeah

315
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,300
that's really and you know so I ended up

316
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:31,919
one of the few places by sheer chance

317
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:34,199
uh long before it was famous you know so

318
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,240
um that's kind of that kind of yeah I

319
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,759
mean there are two Maui dogs like I said

320
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,579
one of them is from my work that's Maui

321
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,700
super dog and one of them is uh uh

322
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:47,699
potentially a dog bag seed crossed to

323
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,019
some skunk in hope in Hawaii yeah I

324
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,320
think matchmaker is also right there's

325
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,299
the dog in Maui dog and one is Maui dog

326
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,720
with one g I think and then there's the

327
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,879
dog with two T's that's also yeah it

328
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,160
gets even more confusing

329
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,679
you know it's very confusing it's very

330
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,059
confusing I believe Maui dog was popped

331
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,819
they said they popped it when they got

332
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:11,458
back home so it probably dates from 99

333
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,320
or 2000 or something yeah and the one

334
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,138
thing I will actually say that leads me

335
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,860
to believe that the actual straight Maui

336
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,919
dog could be an S1 of uh

337
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,659
um actual chem dog is that

338
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,899
um you know I got to see a number of

339
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:32,458
rooms run by our buddy CSI they were all

340
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,860
uh chemdog 91 s ones and boy does that

341
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,679
Maui dog look like an S1

342
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,839
yeah it does I mean is that proof

343
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,179
without genetic testing no it's not but

344
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,339
a dead boy does it it really you could

345
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:47,638
see a bunch of things in that room that

346
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,740
looked very very close to that cut

347
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,079
and yes there's also skunk dog someone

348
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,778
just posted it out yeah skunk dog is a

349
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,519
child of that cut yeah and then the only

350
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:58,379
and the other part of it that may that

351
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,940
may be true is that three out of the

352
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:03,240
four people that I knew of at the time

353
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,540
that had uh chem dog in California we're

354
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,360
growing it in the Sonoma area

355
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:13,139
I spilled all over myself I was I was in

356
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,000
southern Mendo uh skunk VA was in was in

357
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,039
Sonoma then

358
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,399
um uh our buddy from Staten Island was

359
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,599
in Sonoma then so it's it's I mean it's

360
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,679
possible you could someone could have

361
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,540
bought a bag

362
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,379
you know

363
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,419
um

364
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,458
so yeah so what's the first one we want

365
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:32,059
to cover do you want to cover the uh the

366
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:34,439
mom techniques or do you want to cover

367
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:36,479
long-lost strains

368
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,220
we could cover we could cover mom

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,459
techniques first that's probably a

370
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:46,139
little bit more concise of a topic yeah

371
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:48,000
um so Mom techniques are uh you know

372
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,339
there's uh they've gotten a little bit

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,100
more complex in recent years

374
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,040
right which we'll get to in a minute but

375
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,060
basically uh the way I always did it was

376
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,120
that

377
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,799
you know if you want to start a new mom

378
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,060
um I would you know let's say You're

379
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,539
Gonna Fill let's say You're Gonna Fill

380
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:08,539
your room with with a run and your mom

381
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:12,958
is getting kind of old and tired right

382
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:15,299
so you you veg up your room and what I

383
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,698
would do is that I would pick the

384
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,859
healthiest nicest dankest looking

385
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:22,740
vegetative plant in the entire room to

386
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,778
be my new mom yeah the one that hurts

387
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,180
your heart to not put in the bloom room

388
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,799
because you wish that all of them in the

389
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,419
bloom looked like that one in the

390
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,519
beginning

391
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:34,679
um because you always want to start with

392
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,078
the healthiest stock you can I believe

393
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,078
that in ag it's called the cultivarca

394
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,759
and and moms and plants can get beat up

395
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,759
and it can take months there's a season

396
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,240
or two to get them back to health

397
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,639
so it's always key to keep

398
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,240
um to keep moms like to keep the best

399
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,278
stock possible yeah I think uh the other

400
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,720
thing that not everyone gets to do but

401
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,000
I've gotten to do for the last couple

402
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,620
decades is

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,620
um and Shanti does this too which is

404
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,440
kind of cool is that the Sun goes a long

405
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,019
way to healing plants so if it's

406
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,600
possible for you in your area without

407
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,039
being getting in trouble or something to

408
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,079
put your plant outside with some

409
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,179
artificial light in the night time in

410
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,979
Spring and early summer and you give

411
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:23,338
that plant two or three months of

412
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,440
growing outside or in a greenhouse and

413
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,760
then you take cuts off it and bring it

414
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
back in

415
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,278
that cut will be a lot healthier yeah

416
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,680
um I think some of that is mitigated now

417
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,659
because when when that Tech existed

418
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,399
there was kind of like two kinds of

419
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,860
indoor lights metal halides and high

420
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,139
pressure sodiums and both of them were

421
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,159
uh pretty limited compared to the Sun

422
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:49,560
yeah now we've got ceramic metal halides

423
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,439
and plasmas and a lot more things that

424
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,719
you can get like a wider Spectrum

425
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,699
you know so I think that makes that

426
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,680
makes a big deal and then they've talked

427
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,179
about it before but

428
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,620
um one of the ways like especially with

429
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,740
all this dudding and stuff like that

430
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,759
that's been going on and viroids people

431
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,620
talk about outgrowing the viroid where

432
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,199
they try to take cuts off the growing

433
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,938
tips yeah because it maybe hasn't moved

434
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,000
all its way up to the plant

435
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,279
and that was kind of accepted Tech but

436
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,959
now there's this wrinkle to it where

437
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,078
they actually say that there could be

438
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:30,740
more genetic drift at the tips

439
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:30,740
and the lowers might have less mutations

440
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,220
who says that I could show you some

441
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,659
stuff after the show yeah but it's

442
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,460
really coming out and so now there's

443
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,220
like a little bit of a conflict of like

444
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,558
you know less genetic mutations Perhaps

445
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,779
Perhaps lower down on the plant but then

446
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,460
more risk of disease if any exists in

447
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:51,178
the plant

448
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,980
um but long-term maintenance is hard uh

449
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,660
keeping these these plants alive and

450
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,419
keeping them happy and healthy for a

451
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,120
long time yeah uh is tough and the

452
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:03,000
larger of a collection you get the

453
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,399
harder it is to keep them all happy

454
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,619
yeah that's that's for [ __ ] sure

455
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,660
because a lot of times I want some needs

456
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,279
yeah Matt can speak to this too somebody

457
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,720
like you know if you have a big

458
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,058
collection and you're breeding all the

459
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,798
time you might have 80 of your

460
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:19,319
collection I don't want to stay in

461
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,879
stasis but like you're kind of giving it

462
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,798
low light and you're not trying to let

463
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,200
it get out of control or grow all crazy

464
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,940
yeah and then the 20 of stuff you're

465
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,380
gonna take cuts off of and use in

466
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,840
various breeding projects you're

467
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,400
boosting under better light yeah because

468
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,959
if you boost everything under a better

469
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,880
light it's expensive and then everything

470
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,220
grows way too fast

471
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,080
and then you're hacking and slashing and

472
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,779
training and doing a bunch of work just

473
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:46,319
to keep them you know they outgrow their

474
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:48,660
pots they outgrow their happiness level

475
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,000
um you know so Mom rotation is a big

476
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,820
thing yeah

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,579
I'm still a big fan of the the

478
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:59,579
10 by 20 tray full of Pearl Light in the

479
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:03,178
bottom [ __ ] three foot tall clone

480
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:04,740
miles right yeah just yeah yeah I I've

481
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,019
been guilty of that one several times

482
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,700
but it's just because it like like he's

483
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,500
talking about it's it's a real easy way

484
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,480
to keep things growing as slow as

485
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,660
possible uh when you're doing it like

486
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,740
that because sometimes yeah keeping moms

487
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,700
doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna

488
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,259
run

489
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,519
um all that clone Stock A lot of times

490
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,579
you're just throwing [ __ ] out because

491
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,200
you've backed up 10 or 20 uh yeah and

492
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,058
you might only say Mom you might only

493
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,058
need three or four plants but you take

494
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:32,460
25 Cuts yeah so you can and then you

495
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,918
know I was talking to CSI last night and

496
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,440
you know I mean the amount of backing up

497
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,720
that he has to do versus like the

498
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,600
collection that he has as far as moms

499
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,319
versus the Fino hunting that he's doing

500
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:48,959
versus all that it's like it can be kind

501
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,599
of exponential yeah it's almost like 80

502
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,880
like think about it's like 80 of my uh

503
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,699
actual stock that I would keep would

504
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,500
just be backups of moms and even

505
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,080
counting the flower stock it still seems

506
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,079
like all I kept was constant backups and

507
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:06,960
moms I see our I see our Buddy Radio

508
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,460
Ridge uh on here and a lot of the stuff

509
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,038
that I'm talking about is trying to

510
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,798
maintain moms like in a house inside in

511
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,599
a garage in limited space

512
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,160
um obviously if you have if you have a

513
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,839
nursery or you have a greenhouse or

514
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,298
multiple greenhouses and you can use

515
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,918
natural and artificial light it gets a

516
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,859
little easier

517
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,799
um but a lot of Fino hunting on that's

518
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:30,538
done in cannabis traditionally is a lot

519
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,639
of space

520
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:35,519
yeah that's a good question thoughts on

521
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,440
reveging a plant becoming a mom so I I

522
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,058
instead of doing the outdoor thing that

523
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,340
not so I was talking about I like to do

524
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:43,918
the Revenge stuff and I and I tended to

525
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,439
do it anyways because you know if I lost

526
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,600
you know clone stock of a mom that I

527
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,340
just floured out what have you or if

528
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,678
something was was

529
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,779
riding a lot slower than it than it

530
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,160
should be it wasn't as resinous a lot of

531
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,538
times I give it a revenge and it would

532
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,798
just give it that little bit of a boost

533
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:03,538
so I I I I but I run my my veg at 24

534
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,058
hours light all the time so it's really

535
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,740
easy for me to re-vege you know

536
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,119
somebody's talking about genetic drift

537
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,640
off the main street that's part of the

538
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,159
issue is that cannabis is just starting

539
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,299
to get studied in certain ways

540
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,519
um so there's a lot of new information

541
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:18,980
coming out and some of our traditional

542
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,500
techniques are going to come up against

543
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,000
studies and Science and uh you know

544
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,380
we're gonna have to see how it all plays

545
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,720
out

546
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,799
um you know I I always try to take a

547
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,798
when it's when it comes time to

548
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,980
re-veging for me I don't really re-vege

549
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:37,259
I re-vege until I can take fully in

550
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,819
vegetative healthy cuts

551
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,819
yeah and then I start over

552
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,120
yeah that's a good plan too but Reve

553
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:48,119
Edge is great it just it just takes a

554
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:51,000
while uh sometimes one of the techniques

555
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,639
that breeders also use is sometimes like

556
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,859
when you're Fino hunting you um you

557
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,038
might take a bunch of cuts like two

558
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,538
weeks into into bloom and you end up

559
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,640
going in there and cleaning up a lot of

560
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:05,158
the lowers which you have to strip out

561
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,980
anyway and you use those as cuts and

562
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,620
then they freak out for four to six

563
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,980
weeks yeah but that's actually helpful

564
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:16,798
because it slows down the process and

565
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,419
they don't get too big yeah because if

566
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,700
you can't take a ton of perfectly

567
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,259
healthy Cuts right before you flip you

568
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,240
might have to take cuttings multiple

569
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,140
times before you're even done with the

570
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,240
cycle

571
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,220
yeah if you're trying to keep them small

572
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,359
and contained

573
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,279
you know

574
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,899
yeah so

575
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,599
um and there's writ I mean the the Euros

576
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,280
are really big into Revenge uh they

577
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,678
would do things like they wouldn't keep

578
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,658
any back stock of anything and then when

579
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,880
they found flowers they liked they would

580
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,140
take that that plant out of the room and

581
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,020
re-vege it

582
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,179
yeah that's a gamble

583
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,918
it is easy to re-vege for me because of

584
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,559
the 24 hours thing I never really really

585
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,440
lost a lot of plants and re-veging but I

586
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:01,259
also was a big um fan of keeping as much

587
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,900
bud on the plant for re-veging because

588
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:06,058
Bud would grow out of ever I mean uh the

589
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,980
Revenge nodes would grow out of every

590
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,538
single spot on that bud so the more bud

591
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,980
you keep the better the chance you have

592
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:13,440
and a lot of people don't like that

593
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,779
trade-off of like not being able to you

594
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,759
know cut cut butt off and smoke it do

595
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,678
all that but when it comes to a revech

596
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,000
sometimes it's uh one outweighs the

597
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,280
other

598
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,440
and my Matt might disagree with me on

599
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,839
this but if I had an inkling that I I

600
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,360
might want to re-vege ever I would

601
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,178
typically leave all the lowers on

602
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,819
yes so then I could chop the plant way

603
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,059
back yeah and take all the well-formed

604
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:41,579
buds off and leave all the larfy funky

605
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:44,099
stuff is the new tops and they're not as

606
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:46,439
far into Bud as the rest of it so it's

607
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:49,500
not as long of a process to get them to

608
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,960
snap back and go back into flower yeah

609
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,599
I mean for so so what people understand

610
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,480
what we may mean by Revenge just so we

611
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,939
get uh clear too I'm sure most people

612
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,519
understand it but when you when you flip

613
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,320
uh you take a a vegetative plant and you

614
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,359
flip it into bloom

615
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,639
um that white cycle releases a whole

616
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:11,038
whole bunch of hormones

617
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,620
right and those hormones are there to

618
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,879
like make the plant produce flour and do

619
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,339
all the various things it's going to do

620
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,100
in bloom well if you stop that process

621
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:23,459
and you throw it back into Veg it's got

622
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:25,379
to work all those hormones out of itself

623
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,960
right and that's where you get you'll

624
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,360
get a lot of like single blades three

625
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,759
leaves a lot of very funny looking

626
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,558
growth for a while and you kind of know

627
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,099
you're out of it when your plant starts

628
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,500
throwing very normal Leaf structure

629
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:42,359
uh without any pistols or any kind of

630
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
weirdness like that and it can take a

631
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,839
few months

632
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,279
yeah usually it does it can take a few

633
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,259
months

634
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,899
um you know and the more larf you leave

635
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,579
on the bottom the easier it is yeah I'm

636
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,159
not saying it's impossible but it is

637
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:58,939
harder to get things to re-vege out of

638
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,940
main buds

639
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,360
yeah I mean I I usually get a pretty

640
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,740
good Healthy Growth out of all devices

641
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,279
from my perspective maybe I should

642
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,140
rephrase it is uh you get less rot yes

643
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,399
yes that's for sure because you might

644
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,140
end up having to go out there and cut

645
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,360
out mold because now you've got this

646
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,460
like overripe flower that's trying to

647
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,959
figure out what it wants to do maybe

648
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,819
it's dense and you're trying to get

649
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,440
vegetative growth to come out of it and

650
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,759
then the bud is rotting around the

651
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,000
vegetative growth and you're cutting

652
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,879
stuff out and so you know I mean it

653
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,740
there's a lot of ways around it

654
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,539
um and you know just not not only that

655
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,400
like not all strains act the same either

656
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,440
that's for sure

657
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,778
so

658
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,278
um yeah you know the the killing of the

659
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:47,099
fun the funny thing we always joke about

660
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,019
is like the the cuts that don't make it

661
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,359
in the backup those are always the

662
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,158
favorites yeah that's uh that's genuine

663
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,319
generally how it works that's how the

664
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,600
the one that you're like oh my God this

665
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,700
one is amazing and you've got like 75

666
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,879
Cuts saved and you lost three and it's

667
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,759
one of the three yeah it can be very

668
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,080
frustrating yeah

669
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,220
so

670
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,619
yeah

671
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,659
you know but that's Mom maintenance is

672
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:15,538
basically like you can only leave a

673
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,159
plant in a pot for so long

674
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:19,558
um there's a there's an arc of Health

675
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,360
that happens kind of yeah

676
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,278
um and you can get plants on the upswing

677
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,379
and on the downswing

678
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,058
um sometimes when you're re-veging I

679
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,559
should throw this out there sometimes up

680
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:30,658
potting the plant

681
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,000
and giving the root mask especially if

682
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,440
it's like you pulled it out late

683
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,859
um giving the plant a bunch of fresh

684
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,840
soil to grow new Roots into yeah versus

685
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,178
like stuck in the same pot that it's

686
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,220
been kind of root bound a little bit

687
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:47,580
tends to help do you ever do any root

688
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,419
trimming root ball trimming

689
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,079
um

690
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:54,480
I don't usually Bonsai my [ __ ] no uh

691
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,418
sometimes every time I've done it I've

692
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,940
just [ __ ] trashed plants like I've

693
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,380
tried it like you know I mean Bonsai is

694
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,960
one thing but [ __ ] trimming up the

695
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,840
root ball I always [ __ ] that up always I

696
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,579
cannot trim roots and keep [ __ ] alive I

697
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,259
do I mean I do think that like when

698
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:14,240
you're transplanting I do like to take

699
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,259
my hands and rough up the edges Because

700
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,319
unless you're growing in like certain

701
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:21,240
kinds of air prune pots the a lot of the

702
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,000
pots tend to the roots tend to chase

703
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,278
each other's tail right and so you and

704
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,079
so you want to break that up so they so

705
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,480
they shoot out new shoots essentially

706
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,519
I'm talking about taking them and like

707
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,319
if they're in a [ __ ] five gallon pot

708
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,940
trimming the [ __ ] root ball down to

709
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,639
like a [ __ ] three gallon have you

710
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,220
ever done that I have not done that I've

711
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,640
seen people take like bread knives and

712
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,980
like shave you know

713
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,419
I just generally rough it up on the

714
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,659
outside and on the bottom as much as I

715
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:52,860
can and then pop it in yeah yeah

716
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,320
um but that doesn't mean it might not

717
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:58,500
work you know

718
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,240
um you know so there's a I mean if

719
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,019
that's kind of bonsai techniques right

720
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,019
yeah

721
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,400
but I never could get the root mass [ __ ]

722
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,400
down ever

723
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,440
yeah you know bread knife

724
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,298
that type of thing but I mean it you

725
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,340
know generally speaking I would say

726
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,500
everyone has different opinions on this

727
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:24,119
and it depends on what you're using your

728
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,679
mother for

729
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,558
um but you should replace a mom every

730
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,500
six or nine months yeah

731
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:35,158
as a general rule you know and always

732
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,200
always always keep the healthiest plant

733
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,880
yeah boosting the end like obviously if

734
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,620
you're not flowering at the point at the

735
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,539
point where you decide that you want to

736
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,000
re-vege a plant you're no longer feeding

737
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:47,158
it for flour you're feeding it to be

738
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,319
brought back to a vegetative state so at

739
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,900
that point feeding it more in Cal Mag

740
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:53,939
all that [ __ ] helps yeah a more balanced

741
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,679
meal than as opposed to like a Flour

742
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,240
Mill that's low nitrogen you definitely

743
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,440
want nitrogen it's gonna it's gonna

744
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,778
freak out

745
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,419
and uh look weird for quite some time

746
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:05,538
yeah so you have to have some patience

747
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,440
you know yeah

748
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:09,720
you definitely have to have some

749
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,120
patience with the Revenge but it's a

750
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,460
it's a useful technique it's a space

751
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,319
saving technique just like anything else

752
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,960
that has its own risks

753
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,058
you know yeah um you could be you could

754
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,960
be bringing pests from your flower room

755
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:26,038
that don't exist back into your mom

756
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,399
yeah

757
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,158
yeah that could happen too yeah

758
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,379
um

759
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:37,260
but yeah I mean mom maintenance is

760
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,100
You Know It uh it takes a while for moms

761
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:42,778
to uh to build up the right kind of cuts

762
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:44,339
you know and you kind of start with like

763
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:45,898
a small plant that can give you one or

764
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:48,839
two cuts and it kind of takes a few

765
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:50,519
months of training a plant to get like

766
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,298
this plant's gonna give me like a room's

767
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,639
worth

768
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:56,579
yeah or I've built my plant up to X so

769
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,679
it really does depend on what your goal

770
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:01,439
for the plant is I mean I have a bunch

771
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,140
of plants and a lot of them I only need

772
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,759
a few cuts off of every now and again

773
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,799
so it doesn't do me any good having them

774
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,700
in a giant 10 gallon pot and as tall as

775
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,898
me yeah I know not at all you know but

776
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,759
people let it get that way and then

777
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:16,739
sometimes it's really tempting for a

778
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,538
grower you see a mom getting super

779
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,599
healthy and you don't want to beat that

780
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:23,640
the tar out of it yeah you want to let

781
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,339
it boost

782
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,820
you know so so while we're talking about

783
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:32,038
Mom health and and you know taking Cuts

784
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:34,259
backing up Cuts what's one of the ones

785
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,359
that you've uh lost in that kind of

786
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,278
situation where

787
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,740
um you were trying you thought you had

788
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:43,019
you know clones of it backed up maybe

789
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,159
and had one mom flowered it out and

790
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:46,158
realized you were [ __ ]

791
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,140
um I've lost all kinds of plants yeah it

792
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:54,239
would be hard to pick just one

793
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,520
um I'll start maybe like General and

794
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,620
then we can go into specifics yeah most

795
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,740
people even most of my friends

796
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:04,979
have always just wanted to bloom

797
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,679
whatever was popular at the moment yeah

798
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,500
so it's easy to get Pete like when when

799
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,360
it was the diesel craze or the purple

800
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,419
craze or whatever it was easy to get

801
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:17,879
friends to back up Urkel or Mendo P or

802
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,740
sour or something oh yeah and then the

803
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,960
market changes and they're not growing

804
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,339
it for the market anymore and you're

805
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,620
trying to get them to hold on to

806
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,599
something for you so it doesn't get lost

807
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,119
and they don't want to give up the space

808
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,000
yeah there's a lot of people that try to

809
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,319
have the smallest veg they can get away

810
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,259
with

811
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,359
yeah you know and it makes sense I mean

812
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:40,859
veg doesn't make them the money no it

813
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,479
doesn't make them the money you know and

814
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,678
so I'm not even I'm not even dissing

815
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,259
them on it I'm just saying that like

816
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,880
that's kind of how it is and so you end

817
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:49,200
up trying to like share things with

818
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,299
people

819
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,860
um that you hope that they love it

820
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:55,740
enough that you can get it back from

821
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,599
them yeah and how a lot of these fakes

822
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,919
and how a lot of these issues start is

823
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,918
you have a real cup

824
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:06,179
you move on to do some rooms of

825
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:08,759
something else

826
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,778
and then you go to get it back and it's

827
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,579
not it

828
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:13,980
yeah or they killed it or they were

829
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:17,339
worse at it than you were you know yeah

830
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,460
and so a lot of things got lost that way

831
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:22,558
um people break up have X's you know

832
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,840
that mess things up you get depressed

833
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,658
you move you have accidents you have a

834
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,759
fire you get busted

835
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:31,980
um you know there's a whole host of ways

836
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,919
where you lose things yeah and I think

837
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,740
every old older grower uh every

838
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,080
collector every breeder has probably a

839
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,140
list of [ __ ] that they wish they still

840
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,298
had yeah I would think so I mean I have

841
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,740
a bunch of stuff that you know I was

842
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:48,960
[ __ ] around with when I was in my

843
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,819
early and mid-20s that I wish that with

844
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,100
my current experience I had right now

845
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:56,398
yeah

846
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:58,079
don't you yeah there's a there's a bunch

847
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,639
I mean especially during the Mooney one

848
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,699
where I handed over my whole collection

849
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,919
yeah someone lost all of it in one shot

850
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,298
you know luckily luckily most of that I

851
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,520
was able to get back from other people

852
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:09,778
that I backed it up with but there was

853
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,179
still a lot in there that were my own

854
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:14,519
personal selections of my stuff that

855
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,480
never see again and I'm sure that's

856
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,099
probably one of the more common

857
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,599
occurring things for breeders is to lose

858
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:20,939
their own personal selections quite

859
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,639
often I would imagine and and the market

860
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,000
changes and the the what people want to

861
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,700
grow changes yeah and you end up chasing

862
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,419
something and uh you know and then you

863
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,460
can't

864
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,080
I mean look at right now like you know I

865
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,880
talked about it on a previous show but

866
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,658
it's like sour was the most popular

867
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,880
strain in America for over 10 years yeah

868
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,100
and there's massive debate on who's got

869
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,140
the real yeah yeah

870
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:49,439
and it turns out that most of the people

871
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,600
that have it didn't keep it when it was

872
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,759
unpopular yeah

873
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,639
and they tried to get it back when its

874
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,720
popularity came back

875
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,659
um you know I had a bunch of friends

876
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,600
that had the Trinity and we all lost it

877
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:05,159
and I spent 15 years looking for it and

878
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,940
we kept getting it back and it kept

879
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:11,099
being fake yeah or a hybrid yeah

880
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,838
and there's stories like that over and

881
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,539
over and over again

882
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:18,000
you know what's one of your white whales

883
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,980
in terms of something that I lost or in

884
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,199
terms of something that I want something

885
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,460
that you've lost that you wish you still

886
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:29,638
had I had uh probably next to the Maui

887
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,280
the best thing I ever found in Amsterdam

888
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,639
of all the Pops that I did was I found

889
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,899
an amazing uh Black Diamond afino yeah

890
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:43,019
it was peppery it was Frosty it was

891
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:45,118
extra extremely potent

892
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,519
um and I still think about it was it one

893
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,519
of the purple ones it was not purple oh

894
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,199
it was darker yeah it was darker but it

895
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:53,820
was not purple

896
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,878
um it was very beautiful it had a really

897
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,220
nice kind of long running Cola

898
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,659
um I uh I didn't let the time even

899
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:03,239
realize there was like three or four

900
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:04,679
versions of black domino yeah I think

901
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,118
they made that apparent no it wasn't

902
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,179
really apparent but I bought it direct

903
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:15,320
from Scentsy in late 90s yeah you know

904
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:15,319
and um I had uh I had the Warlock

905
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,720
yeah I really like the Warlock a whole

906
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,480
lot

907
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:27,118
um I you know I lost this I in I lost

908
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,159
the super skunk yeah

909
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,079
you know

910
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,319
um I've lost most things here and there

911
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:37,079
yeah I luckily I share and I don't hoard

912
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,940
and close friends have held it but I

913
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,880
haven't been able to find

914
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,159
um the super skunk since yeah

915
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,838
um and you know skunk VA and some others

916
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:50,098
and stuff we've been hunting for it for

917
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:54,019
a long time and uh the cough I should I

918
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:56,338
saw the cough lives yeah

919
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,980
I don't know about if the cough two

920
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:01,920
lives isn't it I thought this was the

921
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,599
cough too maybe we could ask homie if

922
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,559
he's on here but I think yeah I think

923
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,599
it's cough

924
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,039
and I think cough two is the one that's

925
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,420
gone

926
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,820
um but

927
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,400
you know one of the things about that is

928
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,019
that sadly if you're I don't know if I

929
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,240
don't know who who made that comment or

930
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:19,079
where they're located but

931
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,979
um

932
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,560
You Know It uh the the nl5 aces have not

933
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,240
been nearly as possible or popular on

934
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,338
the west coast as they are on the East

935
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,139
yeah that's for sure so they don't get

936
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:32,820
circulated very much the stuff that got

937
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:34,858

um you know shame but it does it does

981
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,800
force you to move on and uh go down

982
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,740
different Avenues which I think is

983
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,539
always a plus yeah and I got we I got

984
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:23,039
from another mutual friend of ours we

985
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:24,119
got what we thought was the Super Skunk

986
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,759
back

987
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,119
yeah um and then I I got evacuated and I

988
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:34,740
lost it in the 17 fires again

989
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:37,200
so Jesus Christ yeah it sucked I God

990
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,139
damn it I thought I I literally drove

991
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,598
out of that property with like the LA

992
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:45,358
between my legs and the chemd by my feet

993
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,380
and dog cutting right next I mean I had

994
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:51,480
like six one gallon pots you know and uh

995
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,760
that's what I could fit as I fled so

996
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,338
yeah that's [ __ ] Wild

997
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,260
it happens yeah you know but it sure

998
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:00,719
does um I mean there and there's a bunch

999
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,839
of uh Mac and talk there's a bunch of

1000
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,699
famous SoCal stuff

1001
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,000
um you know that we joke about quite a

1002
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:11,338
bit but like the bull rider yeah um the

1003
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,900
Hogs breath

1004
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:15,420
um you know there was some things that

1005
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,099
were kind of common yeah down there at

1006
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,539
least in terms of being sold and this

1007
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,420
and that and they've got their Legend to

1008
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,920
them and they're gone yeah luckily still

1009
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,019
around but it's always been kept super

1010
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,599
tight until the last Maybe

1011
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:29,519
five years now it's been getting out

1012
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,559
everywhere but if for a long time it was

1013
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,539
kept very tight but bull rider I've

1014
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,059
never seen bull rider like I've gone

1015
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,980
down you know been lived down there for

1016
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,960
over a decade in San Diego and it wasn't

1017
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,400
around even by the time I got there the

1018
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,019
bull rider was gone

1019
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,280
um Afghani bull rider was still there

1020
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:45,900
but you always still hear these stories

1021
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,339
about like the original bull rider and

1022
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,260
how good it was

1023
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:50,639
um the closest we have is apparently old

1024
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,740
Betsy

1025
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,719
um but yeah if it's anything like old

1026
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:56,939
Betsy it's probably like a skunk one and

1027
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,578
I'll fly face type I think Matt can

1028
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,338
speak to this Afghani bull rider I think

1029
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:04,079
is a descendant of the bull rider I

1030
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:06,179
don't even know if it if it's been

1031
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,640
proven to even be a descendant it might

1032
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:10,980
be the same thing with a different name

1033
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:12,118
no no definitely isn't the same thing

1034
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,619
um but I don't know if they're

1035
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,280
necessarily even descended from each

1036
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,140
other

1037
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,960
I might have just been two things that

1038
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:21,239
got similar names yeah yeah I would

1039
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,980
think so I mean I I don't really know

1040
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,379
much about the dudes who've made bull

1041
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,179
rider or uh Afghani bull rider I mean

1042
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,800
there's Jeff Tech and then there's other

1043
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:31,559
people who say they did

1044
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,079
I don't know I don't know but I mean if

1045
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,659
if bull rider is anything like old Betsy

1046
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,880
then Afghani bull rider was totally

1047
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:42,059
Afghani dominant and had no traits like

1048
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,640
the old Betsy if that makes sense and I

1049
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:48,599
think lots of regions have

1050
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:50,460
um you know uh stories like that of

1051
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,019
there's plants that are popular that are

1052
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,179
everywhere

1053
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:55,920
um I mean you know we're gonna save the

1054
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:57,419
purple story for another episode and

1055
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,460
we're gonna try to get our buddy on here

1056
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,740
to chat about it but yeah

1057
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,300
um but I can say that you know in the

1058
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,578
mid 2000s

1059
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,039
like most of the commercial Growers

1060
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,380
indoor Growers especially up by me and

1061
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,619
Mendo and Southern Humboldt they all had

1062
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,599
purple yeah or purple was everywhere for

1063
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:18,720
a long time it was everywhere and then

1064
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,700
it becomes unpopular yeah like and

1065
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,699
there's like four Dudes that kept it

1066
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:25,319
yeah I mean I might be exaggerating you

1067
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:27,480
know maybe there's no but there's so few

1068
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,980
so few people kept it yeah but that

1069
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,139
that's kind of what happens is is

1070
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,900
everything's so popular people can never

1071
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:36,118
imagine it going away yeah and then you

1072
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,680
can't find it

1073
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,940
yeah you know and what happens when

1074
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,739
that's the case

1075
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,619
and then you know there's there's an

1076
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:45,799
aspect to it now where it's like uh

1077
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,800
um

1078
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:51,838
oh the wheelchair

1079
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,579
uh that's interesting that JJ had access

1080
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,139
to the wheelchair we used to grow the

1081
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:58,260
wheelchair I had some buddies of mine

1082
00:41:55,139 --> 00:42:00,598
from Chicago that ended up moving out to

1083
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:04,079
Boulder and Longmont and some of that

1084
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:07,619
area and they we all have the wheelchair

1085
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,440
back then and uh I don't have any idea

1086
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:12,180
what it was uh that was kind of an era

1087
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,019
in the 90s where there was a lot of

1088
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:19,019
variety and my my interest in lineage

1089
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:20,460
hadn't sprouted super hard yet

1090
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,099
um but that was a pretty famous thing in

1091
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,440
Colorado there was a Colorado AK-47 that

1092
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,599
smelled smelled like sandalwood and

1093
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,000
yielded incredible

1094
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,140
um you know there's there was a bunch of

1095
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,039
good cuts that uh that went away

1096
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:39,779
um in in a way uh all the name strains

1097
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,539
that started with the purple craze in

1098
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,800
0405 they've all been I've said it

1099
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:45,539
before they've all been bad for

1100
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,579
diversity

1101
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,440
as soon as everyone could grow purple

1102
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,780
and sell it that was bad for diversity

1103
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,000
yeah it was afterwards when everyone

1104
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,200
could grow sour or cushion sell it that

1105
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,480
was bad for diversity too cookies

1106
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,219
very bad for diversity Skittles you can

1107
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,619
basically name every Super popular

1108
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:06,539
strain and Not only was it bad for

1109
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,940
diversity but then once the feminized

1110
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,039
Revolution happened everybody crossed it

1111
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,079
into everything else yes

1112
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,619
and so the era that we're talking about

1113
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:18,780
like in the 90s and the early 2000s that

1114
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:22,318
was sort of like the last era where all

1115
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:24,359
good weeds sold yeah right

1116
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,279
yeah like I mean you can talk about I

1117
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:27,779
mean maybe I'm wrong but like if you had

1118
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,160
a bunch of bull rider today how easy

1119
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,740
would it be for you to even find a

1120
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,118
market for it I I don't like based on

1121
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:35,159
what old Betsy is I don't think there

1122
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,619
would be a market for it

1123
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,078
right you know so it's like some some of

1124
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:42,900
these legends that are amazing it's like

1125
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,380
try to sell them yeah

1126
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:49,680
you know the gar somebody said the

1127
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:53,220
guards the gar might live actually the

1128
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:55,618
car was like an 11 week garlic Bud uh

1129
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:58,439
that was in the SoCal kind of Santa

1130
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:03,300
barbara-ish area uh and it was really

1131
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:06,358
good yeah it was really good I bet so

1132
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,960
um any the Trinity the Trinity lineage I

1133
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:12,779
know it exactly uh it's it's bag seed

1134
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,420
from a bag of headies that a glassblower

1135
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,640
got in Trinity

1136
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,039
um selling some glass pieces

1137
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,019
bitter said they won't take Shoreline is

1138
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:24,358
Shoreline not selling it doesn't

1139
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,818
surprise me but I mean like if they

1140
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:29,338
smoked it they dig it but yeah I guess

1141
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:31,500
based on what they want in the way bud

1142
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:33,358
looks that's what's sad people say they

1143
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,460
want [ __ ] until they have it and they're

1144
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:38,400
like I don't know man

1145
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,199
yeah yeah I mean we we're in an era

1146
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,099
where looks and height matters more than

1147
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,739
effect

1148
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:45,539
and a lot of our friends I see a good

1149
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:47,699
friend of ours posting on nobody wants

1150
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:49,318
cough you know there's a there's an

1151
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:52,139
aspect of it where a lot of my friends

1152
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:54,539
hold on to their favorites

1153
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:57,679
not because they're marketable

1154
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,679
yeah but because they love them

1155
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,358
you know yeah

1156
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:03,139
um

1157
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:04,739
and nobody wants them

1158
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:06,598
bastards

1159
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:08,939
and you're like you you know you grow a

1160
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,680
room of it you grow a crop of it and

1161
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,300
then if you are going to sell it they're

1162
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,980
going to try to hammer you down on price

1163
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,700
because it's not

1164
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,199
you know zookies yeah he just said they

1165
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:21,179
won't take it because of the name of

1166
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,460
Shoreline

1167
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,279
they won't take it because of the name I

1168
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,400
guess it's not Shoreline

1169
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,019
flambe or Shoreline cookies or yeah I

1170
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,420
don't know about the San Diego Green

1171
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:36,380
Crack I can't really speak to that I can

1172
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:40,920
say that green crack is most likely a a

1173
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,640
skunk one Fino yeah that makes sense you

1174
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,720
know

1175
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:45,719
um

1176
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,279
you know but I mean it's it's one of

1177
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:49,618
these things where it's like and that's

1178
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,859
a that's actually an aspect of like the

1179
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,480
the current market is

1180
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:58,019
um a lot of you a lot of people if you

1181
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,760
buy uh if you buy from dispensaries the

1182
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:02,759
dispensary has to want to buy that weed

1183
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,920
for you to be able to buy it yeah and a

1184
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,420
Distribution Company has to be willing

1185
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,119
to buy that weed to offer it to the

1186
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,680
dispensary or so there's a lot of good

1187
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,900
weed that people don't get to see

1188
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:13,980
because they're like oh that that name

1189
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,539
is weird

1190
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,000
I don't want it

1191
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:20,940
yeah you know but I'll take your I'll

1192
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,039
take your Starburst yeah or I'll take

1193
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,300
your cake or I'll take your whatever you

1194
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,739
know

1195
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,119
um

1196
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:32,279
you know so uh I mean like with the with

1197
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,380
the green crack with what uh best was

1198
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,140
talking about too and you like whenever

1199
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,240
I I hear mango the first thing I think

1200
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:40,920
is usually skunk one because that's it's

1201
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:43,500
almost everything I've ever smelled with

1202
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,480
mango has some skunk one dominance in it

1203
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,159
of some sort for the Terps

1204
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,039
um it may not always be the case because

1205
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:53,159
I've had like mango uh or a cantaloupe

1206
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,019
mango type pure Afghani from her app but

1207
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:57,118
typically I would say a skunk one is

1208
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:58,079
what usually trips that mango Turf for

1209
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,480
me

1210
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,519
someone just mentioned you know is is it

1211
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,699
because the buyers at these dispensaries

1212
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:07,619
are only in their they're in their 20s

1213
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:10,139
no uh that's not it it might be part of

1214
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,140
it it's it's a lot of it is because the

1215
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:15,539
dispensaries exist to make money yeah

1216
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:16,858
and they want the best deal they want to

1217
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:19,858
make the most money off their shelf

1218
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:21,480
space and so even in the 215 era there

1219
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,239
was a lot of stuff that people didn't

1220
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,858
want to didn't want to sell

1221
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,779
um because you know you can't really buy

1222
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:30,960
a bunch of good sativas and dispensaries

1223
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:33,240
you couldn't sell J1 in San Diego

1224
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,099
because it was like the at least during

1225
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:37,259
the era I was there all of the

1226
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:38,940
collectives called their like their

1227
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,940
worst of the worst they just called it

1228
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,099
J-1 like around the downtown area so

1229
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,720
people just would not buy J1 anywhere in

1230
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,700
San Diego after that they just ruined

1231
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,078
the whole name for a whole city and

1232
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:52,919
somebody mentioned this too you're

1233
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,700
probably right if if our homie uh you

1234
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,460
know

1235
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,259
um lived in New York City or somewhere

1236
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,019
around there where that could be his

1237
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,540
Market cough might be popular yeah

1238
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:06,599
because there's a there's a there's a

1239
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:10,519
there's a decent market for nl5 haze

1240
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:14,480
type Thanos over there

1241
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:14,480
see if this has salt in it

1242
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,260
no salt

1243
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:27,239
uh um snow cap was yeah the

1244
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:30,180
AK-47 the Pez still exists

1245
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,279
um there's AK-47 that still exists snow

1246
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:33,659
cap is kind of a just a big chunky

1247
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,880
Afghan I don't know if that one's still

1248
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,399
around it was really grown a lot in

1249
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,059
Mendo for a while I think we're putting

1250
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,720
the Pez in um in the nl5 hybrid ground

1251
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:49,199
yeah hybrids uh our buddy CSI still

1252
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:51,659
holds it yeah um I had it for a while

1253
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:55,618
um but yeah I mean there's uh

1254
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:57,480
you know there's the pith is really nl5a

1255
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:01,338
is this kind of really unsellable unless

1256
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,338
you're on this section of the East Coast

1257
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,059
you know it's not popular in the west

1258
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:08,400
it's not popular in Colorado

1259
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:11,460
train wreck uh we could save the train

1260
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,740
wreck story until for CSI we'll have

1261
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,099
that we'll have a buddy on yeah

1262
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:17,759
um and uh you know

1263
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,800
um

1264
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,859
but yeah there's a lot of stuff that

1265
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,680
that that comes out that has its it has

1266
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:29,578
its name and has its time in the sun

1267
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,259
um and uh the Pez is probably an alfino

1268
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,760
yeah that I believe that's what he said

1269
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,740
there's an elephant that's why we're

1270
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,079
moving in the nl5 stuff yeah that's an

1271
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:40,139
alfino it's an old nlfino and a lot of

1272
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:43,260
this stuff is good they just uh you know

1273
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:45,179
it just doesn't it just loses just loses

1274
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,520
popularity and then someone's like I

1275
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,919
want whatever I'm growing I want someone

1276
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,619
to come to my house or if I go take it

1277
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,940
somewhere I want everyone to buy it

1278
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:56,160
quickly

1279
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,920
I think someone's confusing pif with HB

1280
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,879
13 in there they're not the same thing

1281
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,619
definitely not the same thing definitely

1282
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,338
not

1283
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,960
um

1284
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:05,219
I don't know if Brooklyn really likes

1285
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,900
sativa because they want to be more

1286
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:09,598
productive I think

1287
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:12,180
Cubans and Dominicans and you know

1288
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,338
various groups up there sold it a bunch

1289
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:16,500
and a bunch of people smoked it and a

1290
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:19,619
bunch of rich people and and Elites and

1291
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,199
and stars back there wanted it and then

1292
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:25,500
it kind of fueled a haze wave in New

1293
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:28,919
York much like uh wealthy people fueled

1294
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,619
a cush wave in La yeah

1295
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,318
and then it eventually it kind of it

1296
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:36,180
gets a life of its own yeah you know and

1297
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,219
I'm not saying that like people might

1298
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:39,598
not prefer it but it's just like that's

1299
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:42,539
the thing is it's like it's got a market

1300
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,599

1317
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,720

1323
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:47,099
engraved I mean the cool thing about uh

1324
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:49,259
the cool thing about sativas

1325
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:51,720
um like nl5 Haze and stuff is they do

1326
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,540
have a different buzz and so they they

1327
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,858
they you know um they basically like hit

1328
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:57,358
you differently

1329
00:51:55,858 --> 00:51:58,920
yeah and so they're they're really

1330
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,960
that's the cough all of them they all

1331
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,180
have a really good effect a lot of times

1332
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,519
people feel warm they feel happy they

1333
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:07,980
get a different kind of buzz

1334
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,858
um a lot of times they're ugly

1335
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,619
in injured colds I think it's injured

1336
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:15,420
called the Ingrid coal

1337
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:20,338
injured gold

1338
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:22,680
yeah so pith is not an nl5 Haze and

1339
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:25,679
different than HP no piff is probably an

1340
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:28,139
nl5 Haze and HP 13 is not related

1341
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,480
there you go

1342
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,639
so you know yeah I mean there's there's

1343
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,260
a bunch of different stuff and so like

1344
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,960
on the west coast it's like a lot of

1345
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:41,359
people [ __ ] on A's because most of the

1346
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,358
best Pinos of it never made its way out

1347
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,318
hey Gene what's Ingrid do you know

1348
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,720
anything about it I never just say his

1349
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:54,480
buddy had it huh yeah

1350
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:56,459
um is pif the same as Cuban black it's

1351
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,380
hard to say there's a number of phenos

1352
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,960
that float around

1353
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,180
um and a lot of times you know names get

1354
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,639
used independently

1355
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:09,058
um and uh of each you know or

1356
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:12,139
interchangeably I should say yeah so

1357
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:14,880
um I used to think that pif Cuban black

1358
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:16,500
Heights Haze I could name four or five

1359
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,900
other names were all kind of names for

1360
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,940
the same strain and then some people

1361
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,800
from back there were like oh no this one

1362
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,079
is this and this one is that this is why

1363
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,640
this is that and so you know it's just

1364
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,559
another more more compartmentalized

1365
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,299
knowledge

1366
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,760
um here I'll do this one can you explain

1367
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:36,119
the difference between HP 13 G13 and

1368
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:39,599
88g13 HP uh yes

1369
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:42,900
G13 HP is a hybrid with G13 in it and HP

1370
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,180
13 is related to neither

1371
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,760
there you go yeah Cuban black Haze is an

1372
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:50,338
nl5 Haze

1373
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,859
uh mostly yes you know there's a number

1374
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:56,039
of different nicknames for it

1375
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:57,838
um you know lizard hashplan I have no

1376
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:03,358
idea

1377
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:04,858
um you know but I mean I love old weed

1378
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,920

1379
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:11,219
um Puck and u-dub

1380
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,079
uh Puck is an old hash plant

1381
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:16,318
um they used to call it Puck because it

1382
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:18,660
got uh dude used to carry it around in a

1383
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,420
hockey puck container it was like a

1384
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:23,759
bubble tape bubble tape bubble tape

1385
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,740
container yeah yeah type of thing and so

1386
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,079
they ended up calling it the puck

1387
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:31,259
um it's an old ugly

1388
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,380
um hash plant looking thing

1389
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:38,040
um and it's mostly famous for uh being

1390
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,480
old for being old and people keeping it

1391
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,519
back for no reason

1392
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,960
yeah I mean there's I you know we have

1393
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,659
some buddies from that part of Colorado

1394
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,358
and like out of the half a dozen strains

1395
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:50,399
that those guys used to run the puck was

1396
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:52,440
one of their least favorite didn't mean

1397
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,680
they didn't like it but it's always been

1398
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,420
short hard to grow notoriously hard to

1399
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:00,299
root

1400
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,159
um but one of it is old

1401
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,818
you know yeah

1402
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,399
um

1403
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:07,679
how old is the G13 clone that's floating

1404
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,599
around G13 is one of those things that

1405
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,779
has a bunch of Legends to it

1406
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:16,740
Neville claimed that the G13 that they

1407
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:19,500
sent out to Europe got sick and died by

1408
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,239
93 or so

1409
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,039
um there's been a lot of claims most of

1410
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,500
the G13 that people talk about is

1411
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,960
actually G13 nl2

1412
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,358
which was sold as a line by Neville for

1413
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,240
some time I think Matt even got some of

1414
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:36,659
those beans yeah from Neville yeah

1415
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:40,799
um but G13 and we should deal with this

1416
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:42,719
now too it's like with the NL or G13 or

1417
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,260
Haze or any of this stuff there's all

1418
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:48,358
these the 90s are long ago now or these

1419
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,859
Legends people pop up with this

1420
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:51,659
legendary name

1421
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:54,960
yeah

1422
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:56,338
right and even if you're a casual Stoner

1423
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,780
you might have heard of these legendary

1424
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:00,000
strings

1425
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,640
yeah and then someone pops up with seeds

1426
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,960
or a clone or this or that and you know

1427
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,519
a funny story

1428
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,380
yeah

1429
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,199
um and you know they never tend to pop

1430
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:14,059
up with the unpopular old weed no they

1431
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:16,858
don't it's always the most famous

1432
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:18,839
G13 nl2

1433
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:21,179
um it's a specific selection from G13

1434
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,679
nl2 that was looked most like the G13

1435
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:25,139
clone

1436
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:29,039
we had a buddy who very well might have

1437
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:32,699
had a very old old G13 in Ohio it got

1438
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:35,579
infected with the virus and I was lost

1439
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:38,460
but there was an old G13 floating around

1440
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:41,099
Ohio that supposedly tied back to the

1441
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,659
80s uh I think Fletcher said that that

1442
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:45,000
one was airborne

1443
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:48,299
but there was yeah there was an Airborne

1444
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,858
cut and um what was the other one named

1445
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,900
um

1446
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:55,139
Pacific Pacifica but they called it

1447
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:56,460
Pacific G13 but that I did I ran I ran

1448
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:58,440
all of those

1449
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,480
um I ended up making s1s at the Airborne

1450
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,338
and sending those back to Neville to do

1451
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,780
projects with

1452
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:06,299
um

1453
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:09,059
I really wasn't a fan of the Pacific G13

1454
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,859
motor Rebel and uh breeder Clips used a

1455
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,000
bunch of that stuff and I just ran

1456
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:14,098
through a bunch of it and didn't like it

1457
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,480
but the the Airborne I did think was

1458
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,240
pretty [ __ ] cool it was a thunder

1459
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,519
[ __ ] is a famous name

1460
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,439
um I I got some quarter pounds from a

1461
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:24,179
guy on dead tour

1462
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,059
um who mailed them from me from Denali

1463
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:30,480
Alaska and I don't know 93 or 94 or

1464
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:33,000
something and I loved that weed and

1465
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,740
every every Thunder [ __ ] I've seen has

1466
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,139
been nothing like it since

1467
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:39,118
yeah here's the Thunder [ __ ] was like

1468
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:41,279
kind of a catch-all name

1469
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,680
kind of like Maui Wowie

1470
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,359
yeah maybe and that there was any number

1471
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,399
of different things grown under that

1472
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,119
label

1473
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,318
um

1474
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:54,720
so uh yeah vessel that's that is exactly

1475
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,460
right it came from the Forum days the

1476
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:57,539
Airborne it was a selection of G13 and

1477
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,000
all two

1478
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:01,980
yeah I mean I even remember uh people

1479
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,800
like hempy and Vic high and all that

1480
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,179
arguing back and forth over whether they

1481
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,818
were different and what the provenance

1482
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:11,159
on it was and all this and that it was

1483
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,259
it was uh it was a hot debate for a

1484
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:13,980
minute you know yeah

1485
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,579
um

1486
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:19,858
for sure you know and my buddy sub Rob's

1487
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:22,140
from Alaska from that area and he's been

1488
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:24,719
shouting from the rooftops forever that

1489
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:26,759
like look dude no one ever had the same

1490
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,578
Thunder [ __ ] even if you lived during

1491
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,440
that time in Alaska no one ever had the

1492
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:34,559
same Thunder [ __ ] twice it was never the

1493
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,240
same it was never single cut yeah

1494
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,460
um and you know the Thunder [ __ ] that I

1495
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,259
had I I dude on if someone asked me what

1496
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,260
the Terps were like

1497
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,819
um I was in my teens then and partying a

1498
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,099
lot and traveling a bunch I don't

1499
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:49,380
remember I do remember that it was nicer

1500
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:51,359
than most of the kind bud I could get at

1501
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,900
the time yeah

1502
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,900
I have fond memories of it yeah um but

1503
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:00,900
do I have a clear memory from 1993 1994

1504
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,838
of what it tasted like yeah no I don't

1505
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:06,180
like I and you know I don't

1506
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:08,578
um and mostly just because it's really

1507
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:10,980
hard to describe Terps and no's it's

1508
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:13,079
like one of the hardest things in wheat

1509
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,358
we have a lot of language for visual

1510
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,599
stuff we have poor language for smells

1511
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:20,940
yeah in my opinion

1512
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,500
you know most of the time when we talk

1513
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,179
about now that there's like some

1514
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,179
terpenes coming up people start talking

1515
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:29,639
about serpentaline or mercine or this or

1516
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:31,858
that but most of the time people talk

1517
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:34,739
about smells not about like the actual

1518
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:37,440
smell but what it reminds them of

1519
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:39,419
yeah this [ __ ] smells like linoleum

1520
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,858
or pencil shavings

1521
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:45,358
or poop

1522
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:49,500
or a guy's dick like or skunk you know a

1523
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:52,259
guy's dick oh man you know so I mean

1524
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:55,858
yeah you know you probably missed the

1525
00:59:52,260 --> 01:00:00,119
era to name a strain famunda yeah it's

1526
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:02,219
probably it's probably not the time I

1527
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,900
could see a few dudes doing it you could

1528
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:05,279
see a few dudes doing that but yeah you

1529
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:09,139
have to relate it to something else you

1530
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,140
know some of them are really easy like

1531
01:00:10,338 --> 01:00:14,699
yeah Citrus is really common you can be

1532
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:17,639
like oh that's Citrus and everybody

1533
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:20,098
knows what what it's like yeah you know

1534
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:21,659
some things and and not everyone when

1535
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:23,338
they smell things remember oh that

1536
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,779
smells like pencil shavings from when I

1537
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:25,679
used to sharpen my pencil in grade

1538
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,559
school

1539
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:31,739
yeah not everybody has that memory

1540
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:35,579
I never I've never seen the Dewberry

1541
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:37,798
you know CSI describes one of um the

1542
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:39,660
Mendo purposefinos is I want to say it's

1543
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:41,759
either King Snake [ __ ] or coral snake

1544
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:43,739
[ __ ] I've talked to him about it yeah

1545
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,819
yeah like that king snake has actually

1546
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:50,879
got a very distinctive kind of poo yeah

1547
01:00:46,818 --> 01:00:52,440
it's specific it's coral snake [ __ ] and

1548
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,180
it's very specific but unless you've

1549
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,798
smelled it I mean yeah that's kind of

1550
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:58,139
what we laugh about with all the Euros

1551
01:00:55,798 --> 01:01:00,719
is like skunks don't even exist in

1552
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:02,818
Europe yeah so they've never broke

1553
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,480
they've never smelled roadkill unless

1554
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:07,858
they traveled over here yeah you know

1555
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,318
most Americans have smelled the Dead

1556
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:12,358
Skunk at some point yeah you know

1557
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:13,318
because you drive by and it's very

1558
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:15,058
potent

1559
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:16,019
you know

1560
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,540
um

1561
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:21,119
you know but I mean that's kind of like

1562
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:22,139
as far as like strains that were lost I

1563
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,000
uh

1564
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:26,699
a lot of the hazes I've been kind of a

1565
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,500
haze freak for a long time and I used to

1566
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:31,558
think I honestly the first four or five

1567
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:34,260
times I went to Amsterdam I was pretty

1568
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:37,798
convinced that they had bunk

1569
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:40,079
but it was all a great marketing kick

1570
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:42,239
and then like my friends and the hippies

1571
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,160
and the dead tour kids that I knew we

1572
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:47,939
had way better weed

1573
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:50,460
than anyone in Amsterdam yeah right

1574
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:53,579
and then I met some folks and I ended up

1575
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,619
smoking some of the famous Haze cuts and

1576
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:57,539
I was like oh

1577
01:01:55,619 --> 01:02:00,660
okay yeah he's never been the same since

1578
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:03,599
okay you know

1579
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:05,219
um and uh you know and so but those

1580
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,079
things those things are legends they you

1581
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:09,719
know they started circulating in America

1582
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:10,740
the last couple of years

1583
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,399
um

1584
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:15,779
but I think nl5 Hayes is famous for a

1585
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,880
reason

1586
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,500
um here's

1587
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:23,000
a good one for you how do you feel about

1588
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:27,000
Shanti Baba's work these days

1589
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,298
I will admit that I poke less holes in

1590
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,579
shanti's work than most of my friends

1591
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:33,780
uh I would say that's probably accurate

1592
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:37,740
yeah

1593
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:40,140
um you know I I think that one of the

1594
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:42,179
cool things that Shanti Baba has done is

1595
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:44,879
he has not really mixed a bunch of his

1596
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:46,500
work with everything new

1597
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,660
you know

1598
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,039
um and so if you want to get some stuff

1599
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:51,899
that at least has a bunch of old

1600
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:53,759
genetics

1601
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,160
um there's a lot of that on offer

1602
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,200
through him yeah you know it might take

1603
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:00,298
more work to find something that you

1604
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:02,460
want out of it

1605
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:04,858
um it's it's a huge debate as to like

1606
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,059
what he still has and what he's lost

1607
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:07,619
yeah

1608
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,400
you know

1609
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,140
um

1610
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,139
and there was always a lot of junk in

1611
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:15,058
the Amsterdam stuff yeah Amsterdam stuff

1612
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:16,980
in my opinion had a low floor and a high

1613
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:19,200
ceiling

1614
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,599
you know which is not how people like it

1615
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,399
today people like a high floor yeah I

1616
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,019
want to get a lot of average weed or

1617
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,539
just above average weed that looks

1618
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:29,699
pretty nice yes there was a lot of [ __ ]

1619
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:32,279
I popped from same as seed banks back in

1620
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:35,219
the day that was ugly and shitty

1621
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,780
yeah but then there's Finos that popped

1622
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:39,298
out of that did people still hold today

1623
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:41,160
that are amazing

1624
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:44,639
you know yeah

1625
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:46,920
so I can't really I can't really say I

1626
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:49,618
think that there is real stuff amongst

1627
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,539
uh Shanti Baba's work

1628
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:53,400
um I think there's a bunch of junk in it

1629
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:56,039
too I don't think that's like an

1630
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,559
indictment of him necessarily

1631
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:01,558
um it's indisputable that he bought

1632
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,480
Neville's old seed stash yeah and it's

1633
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:05,460
also indisputable that he worked with

1634
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,099
Neville and Neville gave him a number of

1635
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,079
breeding Cuts yeah so he's one of the

1636
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:12,298
few people that can actually claim to

1637
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,619
have access to some of that old stuff

1638
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:17,338
yeah

1639
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:19,260
um but I also think the uh you know the

1640
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:21,179
times have passed them by

1641
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,460
and people don't go to him very much

1642
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:25,980
anymore and they're not searching

1643
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,440
through his stuff very much yeah

1644
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:30,420
um and uh you know

1645
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,818
he kind of I mean if you think about it

1646
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:36,420
he came out with Neville's Hayes super

1647
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:39,599
silver haze and mango Haze and what was

1648
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,519
it 97 or 98 yeah somewhere around there

1649
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,200
so he's and he came out with White Widow

1650
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,239
he's made some really big contributions

1651
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:47,219
to the Cannabis world they're just

1652
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:50,459
mostly multiple decades old

1653
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:53,219
yeah you know which vashanti I found it

1654
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,260
like if I want to to find a longer

1655
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:57,298
flowering line that that is going to

1656
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,099
have some um

1657
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:01,980
gonna have some uniqueness to it

1658
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:04,200
turquoise and and genetics wise he's a

1659
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,358
great place to go granted you'll have to

1660
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,879
to dedicate a lot of space to a good

1661
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:11,759
sized pop because it is older stuff it's

1662
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,640
not like it hasn't been bred for the

1663
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,920
past 30 years [ __ ] just for resin

1664
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,379
production and just for THC potency and

1665
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,380
testing and but if you want to find good

1666
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,420
old like heady sativa [ __ ] his his stuff

1667
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,579
is some of the best places to start I

1668
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:30,139
agree with Gene the he said the mango

1669
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:33,119
has Haze is fire fire yeah

1670
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:35,460
based off of is my favorite cut of nl5

1671
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,798
haze I would love love love if it ever

1672
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,318
appeared in America

1673
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:42,298
um you know and you know his his white

1674
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,099
widow especially in the 90s and his

1675
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:46,559
white family kind of changed the game

1676
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:49,619
yeah um I could also you could you could

1677
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:52,559
say too that since since regular seed

1678
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:54,720
lines are becoming rarer and rarer

1679
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,760
uh if you wanted to actually start doing

1680
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,618
some back Crossing and you needed a male

1681
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,400
pollen donor

1682
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:05,039
he offers all regular seedlines yeah um

1683
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,318
and what I was going to say is that when

1684
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,480
it comes to his Afghani lines and his

1685
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:12,659
more Indica type stuff

1686
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:17,159
I have not had as much success with that

1687
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:19,558
stuff as I have with his uh lines I like

1688
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:22,980
the hazes somebody uh somebody just said

1689
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:25,559
his shanti's [ __ ] line is White Hot Fire

1690
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,960
uh I'm glad you found something you

1691
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:29,099
liked yeah yeah because I ran through

1692
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,500
some [ __ ] and I thought it was pretty

1693
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:34,140
shitty yeah um but that just skunk one

1694
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:37,619
that just that just goes to show yeah

1695
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:39,058
that you know uh you know that um you

1696
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,519
could run through a few hundred seeds

1697
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:43,200
then it's all bunk and then one guy gets

1698
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,538
one pack and finds something that they

1699
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,419
think is amazing yeah and and some

1700
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:49,980
people will find like like pop skunk one

1701
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,139
stuff that haven't experienced skunk one

1702
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:54,358
so much and be like this is fire you

1703
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:56,699
know it's possible totally and

1704
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:58,619
definitely if you're looking for sativa

1705
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:01,439
based lines

1706
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:05,220
um that are that are workable Shanti has

1707
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:08,280
that yeah and uh you know it's um you

1708
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:10,679
know it I like him more than most

1709
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,960
you know but we all have our like we all

1710
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:14,519
have our favorites I liked him until

1711
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,940
that last dealing where I wanted to buy

1712
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:22,440
some [ __ ] and he was all weird yeah you

1713
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:24,780
know I mean he he uh you know I I tend

1714
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,760
to think I mean but that's it's you can

1715
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:29,099
you can get a bunch of us together and

1716
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,260
start talking about about which old

1717
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:33,599
character from the 90s you think is the

1718
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:36,839
least shady and it's hard to get anybody

1719
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:39,720
to agree yeah that's very true I tend to

1720
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:40,798
Lean Into The Shanti Neville camp

1721
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:43,259
yeah

1722
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,900
there's people that are very into Dave

1723
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:47,819
Watson Sam Skunk Man

1724
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,680
um there's you know it's you know

1725
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:51,239
there's people that are very into a lot

1726
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:53,038
of these old guys

1727
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:55,139
you know it's kind of like imagine

1728
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,599
people debating all the people that we

1729
01:07:55,139 --> 01:08:00,298
know 20 years from now yeah you're gonna

1730
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,280
have your camps yeah for sure

1731
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:04,798
you know

1732
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,720
um okay so real quick someone asked

1733
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,219
about the nl5 stuff because I'm getting

1734
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:11,879
tired I'm gonna have to cut it kind of

1735
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:13,919
early but um animal five stuff so we

1736
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,500
have three main cuts that we're going to

1737
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,480
like let out a little bit

1738
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,520
um one of them is the bubble gum Fino

1739
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,159
that I've talked about before

1740
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,859
um it is more bubble gum than bubble gum

1741
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:27,599
the the cut that that me and CSI and a

1742
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:29,940
bunch of others use

1743
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,219
um it is extremely pink bubble gummy and

1744
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,439
loud with the pink bubble gum then we

1745
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:37,198
have a lot of pineapple a lot of

1746
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:39,838
tropical there was a specific Citrus cut

1747
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,639
that we kept Cuts up and

1748
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,140
um well we kept cut to everything but as

1749
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,960
far as like things that we thought are

1750
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:48,060
our Keepers in terms of what is

1751
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,039
considered Keepers nowadays or the

1752
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,199
bubble gum the Citrus and then one that

1753
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,519
we just called The Ranch tank just

1754
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:55,318
because there's no good way to describe

1755
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:59,400
it yet but it's it's

1756
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:01,759
rank as [ __ ] so those are the three main

1757
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:04,559
like if you're going to be pulling for

1758
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,179
really cool [ __ ] that you want to find I

1759
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,859
I both all three of those are pretty

1760
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:09,960
[ __ ] rad

1761
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:12,779
um the the taste transfers a little bit

1762
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:15,000
better than the uh Indiana bubblegum

1763
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:16,679
kind of we'll say that but

1764
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,560
um those are the three main ones that we

1765
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,420
kept but there's a lot of different

1766
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:24,660
offerings in it is it is a very varied

1767
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,798
line so yeah hopefully that helps um if

1768
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:28,079
you're a part of the patreon if you're

1769
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:30,899
part of the breeder Syndicate patreon

1770
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,579
um you can go right now and buy it you

1771
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,960
just have to have backstage access if

1772
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:36,539
you're part of the patreon and you still

1773
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,520
can't see it on rights eco.com and get a

1774
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:41,338
hold of me and I'll make sure that your

1775
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,679
account is hooked up so you can do that

1776
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:45,659
and yeah me and Gene just made a comment

1777
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,460
that I think deserves to be highlighted

1778
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:50,778
maybe he said I don't believe in people

1779
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:53,219
I believe in dank yeah uh

1780
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:55,800
we have we have this phrase we use all

1781
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:57,359
the time that plants don't lie yeah and

1782
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,679
so some of them are like chem dog talk

1783
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,719
and some of that other stuff that we

1784
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:02,640
were doing earlier uh in previous

1785
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,560
episodes was kind of about our

1786
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,500
speculation on like what the plants are

1787
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,719
telling us versus the story yeah and

1788
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,359
dank is dank not everybody agrees that

1789
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,520
every cut is dank obviously

1790
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:17,880
um but most Elites a decent amount of

1791
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,660
people think this weed is fire yeah you

1792
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,239
know

1793
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:26,279
um and you know in all honesty you're

1794
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:27,779
you're no comments on the Elvis uh I

1795
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:29,759
don't think anybody really knows what

1796
01:10:27,779 --> 01:10:31,500
the Elvis was I ran the cut for a long

1797
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,060
time gave to skunk Master Flex and never

1798
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,039
saw it again but

1799
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,920
um as far as what it was it could be an

1800
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:39,420
nl5 Haze but just nobody really knows I

1801
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,980
um I don't have a lot of backstory on

1802
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:43,319
the Elvis it's one of those ones it's

1803
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:46,799
not like we're trying to ignore it

1804
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:48,658
um you know but uh you know it sometimes

1805
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,640
it's it's not like we're an encyclopedia

1806
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:53,039
on just about everything

1807
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,380
um Elvis is a famous cut

1808
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:57,300
um but you know got passed around I

1809
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,279
don't think have you ever grown it yeah

1810
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,659
yeah

1811
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:03,119
I've never thrown it so I have I have

1812
01:11:00,658 --> 01:11:04,738
very little actual like intelligent

1813
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,859
discourse on that one so we're not

1814
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:10,500
ignoring you mine came from Ms Elvis on

1815
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:12,899
THC farmer back in the day who is a dude

1816
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:15,179
that had um he had the regular Elvis cut

1817
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:17,879
and then he had one called the the

1818
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:20,460
pink Cadillac cut and he gave me both of

1819
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,719
them and it I thought it was dank for

1820
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,359
the time but I don't know if it would be

1821
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:26,039
considered date nowadays and I think I

1822
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:29,759
don't know we can talk to we can talk to

1823
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:31,380
CSI you know he takes a ton of pictures

1824
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,739
um there could be some pictures coming

1825
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,600
of uh more pictures of the NL oh yeah

1826
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:38,158
there's tons more coming to the nl5s and

1827
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,659
different ones of the various of the

1828
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,420
various rooms that's one of the coolest

1829
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:44,339
things about CSI is that he's pretty

1830
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,859
transparent

1831
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,480
um about uh you know about his process

1832
01:11:46,859 --> 01:11:51,179
and stuff like that and so people will

1833
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:54,299
be able to get to see fenos yeah and

1834
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:55,980
things of that nature fairly soon

1835
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,840
so

1836
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:00,479
um what's dank nowadays

1837
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,739
um to me I'm more of a Classics kind of

1838
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,079
person

1839
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:06,479
um but what's dank is what you enjoy

1840
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,219
smoking yeah

1841
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:10,500
honestly that's really what it is

1842
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:13,380
whatever jives best with your brain

1843
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,600
chemistry this weed is dank yeah means I

1844
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,340
like smoking this weed and then if

1845
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,140
enough people decide that wheat is dank

1846
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:21,719
It generally gets popular and becomes an

1847
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:24,119
elite of some kind Yeah it's gotten

1848
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:26,340
confusing uh with legality because

1849
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:27,960
everyone wants to have the Dank and

1850
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,699
everyone wants to have white hot fire

1851
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,739
and everything that they're growing is

1852
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:33,839
an elite of an elite

1853
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:37,079
and all they get is [ __ ] wedding cake

1854
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,819
so [ __ ] them so it's you know so yeah

1855
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,579
it's it's it's become a lot modern

1856
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:43,019
marketing rather than like crowd testing

1857
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,359
yeah

1858
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,080
probably should have a better term you

1859
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:49,019
know

1860
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,479
um and uh

1861
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,280
you know they uh you know a lot of the

1862
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:55,139
stuff that that I have and some of the

1863
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:56,639
stuff I've been sharing with CSI and

1864
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,199
others and stuff like that it's just

1865
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,960
like old favorites

1866
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:03,419
it worked with me really well so I held

1867
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,819
on to it you know

1868
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:08,760
um and I mean it's a shame it's a shame

1869
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:11,460
that we don't have a catalog of

1870
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:14,100
all the old strains and all the old eras

1871
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,658
and Seed stock and cutting saved and all

1872
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,780
that because the collection we would

1873
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:23,639
have of diversity from even 1990 to now

1874
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:26,158
yeah which is only you know 30 years

1875
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,360
um or 32 years Jesus but we're being

1876
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,559
pretty insane

1877
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:30,359
yeah

1878
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,500
are you feeling hella old after saying

1879
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:33,479
that

1880
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,179
you know what made me feel old is I saw

1881
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:38,399
this thing that said that right now the

1882
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:41,520
we're far we're as far away from the 90s

1883
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:43,979
as we were from the 60s in the 90s

1884
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:48,060
oh and that made me feel old yeah

1885
01:13:43,979 --> 01:13:50,579
that'll do it that made me feel old

1886
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:52,260
um you know I have a I have a a 23 year

1887
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:55,619
old daughter and she does a great job of

1888
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:57,900
making me feel old yeah all the time you

1889
01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:03,140
know I'm regularly reminded how ancient

1890
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:05,879
I am you should feel all year old

1891
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:08,880
but I'm not that old really I'm only in

1892
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,400
my 40s you know no that's the new 20.

1893
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,340
but when I was 22 I probably I thought a

1894
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:16,319
45 year old dude was hella old yeah dude

1895
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,420
I thought 40 year old was hella old

1896
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,179
until I was [ __ ] 38 then I started

1897
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:23,520
thinking rethinking that yeah you know

1898
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:24,899
and so but I mean that's what's cool

1899
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,980
about it right is that there's a lot of

1900
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:27,960
people now

1901
01:14:25,979 --> 01:14:30,479
maybe we'll I don't know if we'll end on

1902
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,698
this but I should just say it but the

1903
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,678
90s the 80s and 90s and the early 2000s

1904
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:38,279
are long enough away now

1905
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:42,420
that we are getting a deluge of ancient

1906
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:46,259
amazing lines and seeds and cuts from

1907
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:48,179
all over the place right and somehow

1908
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,880
when I was searching for these things

1909
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:53,340
like crazy 10 years ago I couldn't find

1910
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,140
most of them anywhere yeah because they

1911
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,400
were unpopular and nobody could make any

1912
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,920
money off them and they were [ __ ]

1913
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:02,039
nowhere yeah now that there's like a

1914
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,960
whole new generation that you know

1915
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,698
um all of a sudden it's like all this

1916
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,980
ancient stuff that you heard about or

1917
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:10,919

take those into count when we're trying

2012
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:36,658

2016
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:46,800

lives in I I don't want to call it my

2022
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,619
neighborhood but like we live in the

2023
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:00,780
same county

2024
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:03,238
um I've lived here since 98 he was born

2025
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:05,639
and raised here uh you know his his uh

2026
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,139
his parents were weed farmers and so

2027
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,119
there's a certain amount of history and

2028
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,579
just sameness that comes with growing up

2029
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,140
in the same era yeah and the same people

2030
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:15,000
and stuff like that so maybe we could

2031
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:16,619
talk a little bit about some of his own

2032
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,300
work or some of the gorilla stuff or

2033
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:20,819
some of the phases of what it was like

2034
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:22,140
trying to get away with it we're

2035
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:24,299
definitely into the same kind of dudes

2036
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,159
which I appreciate they always have a

2037
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,260
similar taste in men yeah we have we

2038
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,839
have a similar backstory yeah there you

2039
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:32,579
go similar we came from similar eras and

2040
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:35,039
a lot of those eras they're only stuck

2041
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:36,359
in your memory yeah so if you don't have

2042
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,519
other people to talk about them they're

2043
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:41,460
just stuck in your own head there you go

2044
