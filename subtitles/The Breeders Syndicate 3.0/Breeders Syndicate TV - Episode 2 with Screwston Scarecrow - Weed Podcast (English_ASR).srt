everybody's got going on so if you could

94
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,200
start me off bro with maybe how

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,959
you first came into contact with weed

96
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,719
maybe like the first time you smoked

97
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,400
first time you saw it like how old were

98
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:43,799
you stuff like that

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:47,519
maybe uh well I so I grew up in Southern

100
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:52,439
California um for like you know till I

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,319
was 10 and uh my uncles are really close

102
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:57,318
in age to me like we grew up like

103
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,518
brothers um because it took my grandma

104
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:02,238
and grandpa a while to have another kid

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,959
after my mom

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:10,680
um and

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:14,680
uh my Uncle Matt sold weed to you know

108
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,199
his girlfriend's brother was a grower I

109
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,519
guess which I didn't find that stuff out

110
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:25,639
until you know being an adult

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,000
um but yeah I came across some weed in

112
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,918
his room one time and you know we all

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,600
got [ __ ] beat for it

114
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:38,240
but uh I didn't smoke any till you know

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,439
after I came uh to Texas and I was like

116
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,720
12 and me and my friend took some some

117
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:49,639
weed from his mom and rolled a joint uh

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,440
he took his mom's little joint roller

119
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,280
the you know it's like the two bars with

120
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,199
the plastic pie

121
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,638
yeah and you know we' rolled one way too

122
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:06,038
tight and but from that first that first

123
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:10,079
smoke I knew oh [ __ ] I like this so you

124
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:12,199
know that started my journey did you uh

125
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,680
so you got high for your first time then

126
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,360
the first time you tried to

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,879
smoke dude I feel like I did but I know

128
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,639
I didn't inhale at that point like I

129
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,800
didn't know the mechanics of inhaling

130
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,800
you know I thought you're just holding

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,240
it in your mouth but I mean I don't know

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,720
I guess some got in somehow um might

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,079
have been when I was coughing or

134
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,240
whatever because it wasn't

135
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,000
until like a couple months later when I

136
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,840
was smoking a cigarette in front of

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,800
someone and they were like you're not

138
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,839
[ __ ] inhaling and then like showed me

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,560
how to

140
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,560
inhale and that was you know that was a

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,000
whole another

142
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,519
Revelation yeah yeah dude uh I think I

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,839
was

144
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,799
probably I would have been a freshman so

145
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,279
I guess uh I was younger than everybody

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,120
in my class for the most part I thought

147
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,799
I think I was

148
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,720
13 yeah my parents didn't really smoke

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,240
well my mom I found out recently my mom

150
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
smoked maybe like four or five times as

151
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,800
we grew up but it was just like when she

152
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,000
was going through [ __ ] and she would do

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,038
it while we weren't home but um but my

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,759
parents didn't weren't really partyers

155
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,038
my both my parents were my dad was in

156
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
the military and my mom was in the Navy

157
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,759
so like uh it wasn't like they were

158
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,720
hardcore about it it's just like they

159
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,598
just didn't do it but and we just didn't

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,120
have a lot of money so like getting

161
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,879
money for like weed and booze was just

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,840
like not even the option when you got

163
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,519
three kids anyway so um but well for my

164
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,000

169
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:55,038

170
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,719
he he he was real cool bro he was just

171
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,680
[ __ ] weirdo in my math class and I

172
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,879
was like really bad at math so I was

173
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,680
behind so they had me in a a basic some

174
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,120
kind of math class my freshman year and

175
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,280
this guy had failed a bunch and I I took

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
notice of him because he'd come in every

177
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,839
day and literally just sleep all day he

178
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,159
just slept every day and uh the times

179
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,279
that he would talk I thought he was

180
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,240
hilarious bro he reminded me of like a

181
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,758
chich and Chong type of [ __ ]

182
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,240
dude like somebody from a movie like

183
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,120

184
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,199
like dude I just want to know more about

185
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,598

187
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,279

like Black Widow and white widow and

189

190
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,839
captivated me bro and he he gave me some

191
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,240
seeds I went over his house one day he

192
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:45,679
had like this [ __ ] ghetto ass setup

193
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,680
in the garage with like heat lamps and

194
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,959
[ __ ] and you know the plants this big or

195
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,158
whatever and uh he that day he gave me

196
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,038
like um it was Reggie you know had seeds

197
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,839
and [ __ ] but like a joint basically to

198
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,839
roll and he gave me a paper and uh I

199
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,519
went home like the next day was like the

200
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,959
weekend my parents left and I tried

201
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,478
rolling it up bro and like I got so much

202
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,598
slobber and [ __ ] on the joint that it

203
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,918
was just terrible and I didn't like I

204
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,639
didn't know I had never been around

205
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,478
people that smoked or nothing my mom

206
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,439
smoked cigarettes but I never [ __ ]

207
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,959
with cigarettes and bro I just like

208
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,079
tried hitting it tried smoking it all

209
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,918
the [ __ ] on the front porch and like I

210
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,839
just did nothing happened and I was like

211
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,198
what I didn't really understand like

212
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,719
what was about and then uh it wasn't

213
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,680
like it was probably two years later

214
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,038
when I was like 15 I started hanging out

215
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,959
with like some older guys that could

216
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,439
drive bro and we would in Kentucky like

217
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,439
your parent a lot of people weren't cool

218
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,320
with weed back then especially so you

219
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,360
would we would call back we would back

220
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,600
road was what we would call it so like

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,159
me and you know three four guys or girls

222
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
whatever would hop in a car and hit up

223
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,600
like a on lane road that goes on for

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,679
like 20 miles and we would you know Roll

225
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,320
Up and Smoke on there and that's like

226
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,359
some of the first times I really

227
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,440
remember getting actually high high

228
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,800
because uh yeah but we we that's where I

229
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,279
picked up smoking blunts bro was with

230
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:09,599
them with those guys because we had

231
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:11,639
Reggie right so that's like to uh smoke

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,399
blunt to smoke that [ __ ] you had to have

233
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:17,720
like flavored ass [ __ ] wraps and [ __ ]

234
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,159
so but yeah I mean it's also it's a lot

235
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,920
harder to roll a joint with compressed

236
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:28,039
weed with brick weed you know like that

237
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:30,958
[ __ ] just doesn't want to to lay

238
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,879
right yeah years later dude I got one of

239
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,919
those [ __ ] before I learned how to

240
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,879
actually roll uh I got one of those

241
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,039
little plastic cigarette rollers like

242
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,559
you were talking about your your um your

243
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,439
family had and uh those those were all

244
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,000
right if you actually would uh grind it

245
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,880
up and [ __ ] but yeah the first few times

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,159
I didn't even I I mean I still don't

247
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,799
even really use a grinder much today

248
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,000
unless I'm using the The Volcano or a

249
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,599
joint specifically uh actually withun

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,799
blunts I really like to break it up with

251
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,480
my hands bro and just feel it and

252
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,958
something about that process like the

253
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,560
anticipation of it and like it's it's a

254
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,719
mental thing I

255
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,879
guess but yeah well I mean also

256
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,200
functionally uh you know a blunt wrap

257
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,439
isn't G to get [ __ ] up with your with

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,000
your fingers being sticky you know like

259
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,399
it like a paper [ __ ] man I have to break

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,120
it up like I get the paper prepared and

261
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,879
then I break the weat up with the

262
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,600
grinder just to like try and minimize is

263
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,120
you know messing with it with sticky

264
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,440
fingers because paper will tear pretty

265
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,919
easy well if you get now if you're

266
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,200
rocking some [ __ ] like swishers bro that

267
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,679
shit's garbage bro the the [ __ ] I

268
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,040
don't know if you remember or if youall

269
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,638
have swishers but swisser sweets they're

270
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,719
[ __ ] uh usually when you get them

271
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,639
here they're they're bone dry bro so you

272
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,399
crack they're like you open them up and

273
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,959
they're popping apart and falling apart

274
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,078
so if you have sticky weed and you're

275
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,518
rolling with those those are garbage but

276
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,559
uh no I mean dude honestly like I need

277
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,000
to get off these [ __ ] but I

278
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,799
mean right now I got the uh I do the uh

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,600
volcano as much as I can but like if I'm

280
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,000
on a podcast or when I first wake up I

281
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,079
like a little nicotine so I'll smoke a

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,679
I'll smoke a blunt it's just a something

283
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,919
I like to do I know people [ __ ] all over

284
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,838
it but it's just what I like to do bro I

285
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,360
don't know I don't like Flavor anything

286

287
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,519
whatever you know I do not like those at

288
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,680
all bro it's exactly like smoking a palm

289
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:34,519
leaf like it's what you'd expect it kind

290
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:38,120

292

[ __ ] in life uh like mainly food and

293
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,120
things sweets and [ __ ] so I can enjoy a

294
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,039
little bit of nicotine bro it's not the

295
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,200
best thing for me and I know it ain't

296

426
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,119
getting caught with weed and [ __ ] was uh

427
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,720
not good bro and especially growing it

428
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,399
so like growing it that's why it took me

429
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,199
forever I it like took the first time I

430
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,919

431
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,038

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm you know my only option is to grow

504

didn't have anybody who who actually

507
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,678
grew there was a ton of you know like

508
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,240
some one of the guys I bought weed from

510
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,640
uh you know he pretended to grow um so

511
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,359
he'd be telling me [ __ ] and I'd be

512
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,640
trying it and it [ __ ] fail

513
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:59,558
entirely um you know I didn't know the

514
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,320
whole uh 1212 thing to begin with like

515
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:06,279
it was it was a meth you know I was just

516
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:09,678
trying to grow for the longest time um

517
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,558
unsuccessfully very unsuccessfully did

518
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
did you ever have somebody tell you that

519
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:14,639
Donovan guy was talking about in high

520
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,639
school he I tried to grow a couple of

521
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,000
those seeds I forgot about that I did

522
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,080
try to pop a couple of those seeds years

523
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
back when I was probably like I guess 13

524
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:27,960
or whatever but I he told me to use a

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,919
black light bro back then and and I know

526
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,679
he just said put a black light on 24

527
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
hours and let them grow and like of

528
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
course you know they got enough energy

529
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,558
and [ __ ] that they'll pop up so I'm like

530
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,640
I'm growing you know I'm like they

531
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,000
popped up out of the thing but my dad

532
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
asked me my dad found them bro he I had

533
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,880
him like a TV you know back in the day

534
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,960
the big TVs uh like the C CRT or

535
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,440
whatever they have big entertainment

536
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,000
centers and a lot of times they have

537
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,159
yeah with the doors yeah I put put a

538
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,759
couple pots and soil in there and some

539
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,159
of seeds in there and he can't this this

540
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,158
[ __ ] never came up there bro and

541
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,120
he for some reason he came up there and

542
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,520
opened that up and he was like what

543
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,719
what's in there growing and uh I was

544
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,480
just like oh you know I just [ __ ]

545
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,159
around some tomato plants and stuff you

546
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,519
know and he bought it bro or maybe he

547
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,720
didn't I don't know he just just like

548
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,798
whatever but uh he he told me stories

549
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,200
about what got me wanting to try that is

550
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,038
because he told me stories about how he

551
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,240
smoked like when he was a kid which was

552
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,759
like I think he was saying like uh

553
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,359
Colombian red and AAA gold and he

554
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,440
talking about five finger Lids or licks

555
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:33,119
I think it's Lids ain't it I don't know

556
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,960
yeah all this [ __ ] like that and he he

557
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,839
did mushrooms and acid and [ __ ] not a

558
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,720
bunch but he would tell me [ __ ] about

559
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,918
that and he was real into watching

560
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,480
movies bro and we watched like uh Fast

561
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,679
Times and then we watched uh of course

562
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,839
chich and Chong and like just kind of

563
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,640
all this got me curious about everything

564
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,000
you know over the years and [ __ ] with

565
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,320
it and I unfortunately couldn't even

566
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,960
grow I I actually entered into it more

567
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:01,839
from like a like dealing uh side of it

568
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,480
because like you I realized quickly like

569
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,439
I can't afford to [ __ ] buy weed bro

570
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,440
like I want into smoke I think everybody

571
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,640
kind of realizes that and I realized

572
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,720
pretty quickly like man like I'm G have

573
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,360
to do some skipp of the flip here or

574
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,720
something and make something happen so I

575
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:20,000
think it's like everybody's Journey

576
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,919
right you know you you get a zip you you

577
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,278
keep a [ __ ] uh a quarter oven you

578
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,960
sell the other three you know this is 20

579
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,880
years ago mind you uh but uh you know

580
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,679
break it down and you pay for your smoke

581
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,559
basically so it's yeah that I was bad at

582
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,840
that

583
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:42,519
too right I kept I kept trying uh you

584
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:47,399
know I had one of them uh I got one of

585
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:49,119
those uh the little like balance

586
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,880
scales

587
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:55,479

614
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,079
like that uh you know everybody was a

615
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,319
dude right in my town or was trying one

616
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,918
to be or whatever so like for for a long

617
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,158
time I would just rock with this one guy

618
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:27,640
um he ended up going to jail and at the

619
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:29,480
time my all income was weed and uh uh I

620
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,520
remember at that time he got locked up

621
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:37,278
for a month bro and uh he he was pivotal

622
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,200
for my success and what I did because he

623
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,000
was not from there you know he was from

624
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
like Cincinnati so he had connects you

625
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
know out of state and stuff and long

626
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,200
story short he was my plug for like

627
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,278
[ __ ] 10 Years bro and he ended up

628
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,558
going to jail at one point and uh so it

629
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:57,200
made me realize I [ __ ] I need to have

630
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,000
other people so like yeah I would take

631
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,919
more risk after that and if somebody was

632
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,119
like yo I got weed you know any kind of

633
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,600
weight I would go check it out even if

634
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,000
it was kind of risky just cuz like I

635
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,959
said at the time I I just didn't

636
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,880
understand like how I would be able to

637
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,679
manage a normal job bro because I'd been

638
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,559
doing this for so long that like it gave

639
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,798

642
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,599
and I'm I'm just getting to the point my

643
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,639
mid 20s where I'm starting to use my

644
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,480

651
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:46,038
right but for me I did I did the same

652
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,159
[ __ ] as you did I sucked at selling weed

653
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:51,480
for a long time and I smoked it all

654
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,278
until I met this guy by chance bro it I

655
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,038
was making music at the time and I was

656
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:59,000

657
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,200
to trying to like collap with people you

658
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,480

659
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,080
nothing like that so I couldn't I was

660
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,000
just trying to find somebody to rap over

661
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,839
my Beats and I met this kid uh and he uh

662
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,200
he's a lot younger than me but when he

663
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,959
came over we smoked and [ __ ] or whatever

664
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,519
and he's like you know my dad Sals or

665
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,360
whatever and I was like what or he's

666
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,918
like my stepdad Sals and I was like for

667
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,359
real and I was just like everybody you

668
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,360
know at that time would be like yo you

669
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,398
know I got weed and it usually was

670
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:29,519
shitty bro and uh this [ __ ] guy I go

671
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:31,678
over his house one day to record with

672
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,599
him and his dad comes down and he brings

673
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
two ounces of whatever it was at the

674
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,798
time bro and uh the best weed I've ever

675
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,840
seen in life other than maybe like some

676
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,639
GDP or something I'd seen a couple years

677
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:45,000
before that and uh that was like the

678
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,720
start of it like at that point after

679
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,480
over as time went on I quit even hanging

680
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,558
out with that kid and and recording with

681
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,960
them U we went our separate ways but

682
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,558
like for like literally like 10 years I

683
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,079
[ __ ] with that one guy and that made

684
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,639
me that set me apart from all my

685
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,359
competition in town because they were

686
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,679
all [ __ ] with literally the same two

687
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:06,240
plugs the main big guys right and I was

688
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,880
able to differentiate from them this is

689
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,159
mind you back in like the 350 $400 a zip

690
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,519
like days it was good times for like a

691
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,799
couple years because like I said I was

692
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,240
the only one with that and back then

693
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:20,798
that that was before like the the big

694
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,278
hype [ __ ] really came into play bro like

695
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,759
it was before whiz and all those

696
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:26,278
[ __ ] came out with cookies and

697
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,000
doing all that [ __ ] and

698
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,880
basically it was just more

699
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,519
uh variety of weed back then it was

700
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,240
really good like that weed back then I

701
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,240
feel like is better than like weed to

702
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,880
this day that I see in the black market

703
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,359
or W weed but yeah but he was pivotal to

704
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,960
my success there for a long time and pay

705
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:50,678
my bills bro like uh I don't know raning

706
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,679
there but uh yeah so you so you you're

707
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,600
[ __ ] around with weed you're growing

708
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,200
trying to figure it out like at what

709
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:00,079
point do you feel like or maybe what at

710
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,600
point do you have your first successful

711
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:06,359
Harvest and do you remember what it even

712
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,719
was uh

713
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,558
so like I had so I had finally gotten to

714
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,919
where I was harvesting something I

715
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:19,359
wouldn't call it

716
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:24,360
successful uh this is like 06 07 even

717
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:26,639
into ' 08 um I was just getting like cuz

718
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:30,038
I would grow him way too [ __ ] big in

719
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,038
the veg because I still did

720
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,159
I don't know I guess I didn't [ __ ]

721
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:38,240
put together the stretch of it

722
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,519
um so like I would end up with super

723
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,960
[ __ ] just like tiny little Brack real

724
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,640
wispy like

725
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,558
not I thought it was cool you know but

726
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,679
like really it wasn't even worth [ __ ]

727
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:54,359
drying and dealing with any of it

728
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,919
um and I didn't I didn't actually have

729
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,278
like a like a true successful Harvest

730
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,038
until

731
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,599
2011

732
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:07,879
um I went off to the military for a

733
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:10,278
bit and like I don't know when I got

734
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,200
back I was like no I'm gonna [ __ ] do

735
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,960
this I'm gonna do it right so I got a

736
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:19,440
book I I read the whole book I had um

737
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,960
actually got like real internet access

738
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:27,200
because before that like you know we had

739
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,798
a computer and internet um at my mom's

740
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,240
but it's like that computer's right

741
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,480
outside her her room I can't be [ __ ]

742
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,120
on it you know I I searched up tits one

743
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,519
time and got [ __ ] caught you know

744
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,759
like there ain't no way I'm gonna be

745
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:46,399
looking how to grow weed and

746
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:52,960
[ __ ] and uh you know but then I left the

747
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:56,918
house um in ' 05 and uh I was you know I

748
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,840
was basically a [ __ ] Street kid um

749
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,080
you know living in this ghetto ass

750
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,720
[ __ ]

751
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,720
apartment

752
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,240
uh definitely did not have the internet

753
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,038
for that like we didn't have cable we

754
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,679
didn't have [ __ ] um just bed

755
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:16,000
bugs yeah well dude like

756
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,480
I I I was so disconnected from the

757
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
because like I had a phone that I

758
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,599
couldn't even send text messages on you

759
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,599
know it's like call me or

760
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,599
nothing and then like I got out of the

761
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:31,398
military I had a phone with the internet

762
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:34,319
on it and it was like actually pretty

763
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,518
decent uh you know

764
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,599
working and uh yeah that's when I

765
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,399
started

766
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,638
actually like researching stuff and I

767
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:45,918
don't know

768
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:49,479
the the because I dropped out of school

769
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:53,000
so early

770
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:57,240
um it made like learning things

771
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,880
difficult and the Army really helped me

772
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,720
like learn how to learn stuff like how

773
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,720
to teach myself stuff um so I was able

774
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,038
to like really [ __ ] hit the ground

775
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:14,839
running and

776
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:18,158
uh start getting actual harvests um

777
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:20,638
and I don't it was bag seed what I had

778
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,240

00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:43,759
reckless at the time

784
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:47,960

00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,599
gunpoint right and at the time like bro

801
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,000
the way I operated was I never I always

802
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,398
looked at like anything over eight

803
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,720
ounces was a felony of where where I was

804
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,879
at so I would always try to you know

805
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,919
obviously I'm not getting the best

806
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,720
discounts operating like that but I was

807
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,559
playing the saf is way that I could and

808
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,919
uh bro yeah I understand how you what

809
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:55,200
you mean by not giving a [ __ ] because up

810
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,440
until that point like I really never had

811
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,360
like issues with anybody over weed or

812
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,440
like you know you have couple people you

813
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,719
get Gram front or whatever that wouldn't

814
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,639
pay up [ __ ] like that usually like some

815
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,398
chick or whatever you know but up until

816
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:10,398
that point bro you know I had made made

817
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,199
a name for myself in that town in my

818
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,719
hometown and uh uh some cats that had

819
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,559
gotten robbed themselves ended up uh

820
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,358
setting me up type [ __ ] and I was

821
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,279
Reckless at the time I had [ __ ] three

822
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,878
girlfriends I literally left the party

823
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,800
at 2 amm been drinking you know weed on

824
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:32,398
me money on me all this stupid [ __ ] bro

825
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:36,879
I was young and uh yeah bro got held up

826
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:39,440
and uh everything was cool uh you know

827
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:42,159
uh but after that that moment it made me

828
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,800
realize like Yo dude if you're if this

829
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,039
is the life you're thinking about trying

830
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:51,679
to do and sell weed uh it ain't uh it

831
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:53,480
ain't all [ __ ] uh rainbows and

832
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,559
gumdrops or whatever how you want to say

833
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,039
that so at that point like it got a

834
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,960
little bit more serious uh you know for

835
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,719
me CU it's like I'm not trying to go

836
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,519
back to work but I'm also not trying to

837
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,759
get robbed again and uh that's that's

838
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,679
when I changed everything up bro and uh

839
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,680
uh I didn't really give a [ __ ] but I

840
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,960
also was really cautious about what I

841
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,838
did and who I dealt with and I got

842
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,679
really into doing [ __ ] uh like drops I

843
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:22,078
would drop [ __ ] on like back roads and

844
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,159
[ __ ] bro for people and not even like uh

845
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,280
meet face to face cuz up until that

846
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:29,118
point bro I was treating like a college

847
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,160
kid probably would do it just

848
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,000
[ __ ] in and out all day long

849
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:37,838
people I barely [ __ ] know you know uh

850
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599
people that are friends of people's

851
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,719
friends that you know what I mean just

852
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,039
whatever how however I can make a dollar

853
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:46,519
basically you know I would do it because

854
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:50,159
like I said I up until that point man I

855
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,800
had never in my life uh dealt with you

856
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,598
know intense situations like that

857
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,240
especially with like weed because my the

858
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,160
way I had been operated before is like

859
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,639
weed makes friends like you know like

860
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,559
weed is not not that expens like at the

861
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,000
time especially like some of the when I

862
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,639
was dealing with Reggie like this [ __ ]

863
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,519
was cheap as [ __ ] so like the idea of

864
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:08,519
somebody robbing you for you know 50

865
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:10,400
bucks worth of Reggie or something like

866
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:13,159
I don't know bro it's like a [ __ ]

867
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,720
weird ass thing but people did that and

868
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,920
and as years went on there were people I

869
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,679
mean I remember stories of some of my

870
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,800
some of the people I ended up getting as

871
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,279
uh customers bro talking about how in

872
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,039
the city like a mom with like a kid in

873
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,760
the car which I would never recommend

874
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,838
going and picking a weed especially back

875
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,560
then with a kid in the car but uh

876
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:35,960
getting robbed for like a quarter bro

877
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:39,000
and gunpo like the city for for weed bro

878
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,519
so ah but I can relate to you I know I

879
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,719
went on a rant there but I can relate to

880
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,159
you uh about having those moments of not

881
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,239
giving a [ __ ] anymore because you're

882
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:51,118
like damn like you know I don't know but

883
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,199
I wanted to ask you maybe how did uh how

884
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,519
did I guess you said you know the

885
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,879
military kind of straightened you up as

886
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,639
a person and your lifestyle but is there

887
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,960
anything that like has other than that

888
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,480
that maybe you've taken away from you

889
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,199
know being in the army that you've been

890
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,639
able to put into your grow maybe like

891
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:07,759
the discipline or or something Have you

892
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,440
have you used anything that you've

893
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,560
picked up over the years from being in

894
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,679
service and applied it to the grow in

895
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,920
any kind of way or or the plant or weed

896
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,279
in

897
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,000
general uh not really I mean I guess uh

898
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,920
doing clean technique like with taking

899
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,880
cuts and stuff like that would be

900
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,920
something that because I was a medic so

901
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,720
like you know we learned how to make

902
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,960
sterile f and [ __ ] like that

903
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:39,318
um really just the [ __ ] I don't know

904
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,760
the the ability to learn greatly

905
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:45,920
increased uh you know turns out I just

906
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,960
need someone [ __ ] beating it into me

907
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,480
to get [ __ ]

908
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:55,358
sorted hardheaded

909
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,639
yeah but uh but yeah dude um so I mean

910
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,759
we've talked about like the beginnings

911
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,679
where you you know you're getting to the

912
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,599
point where you're you know getting out

913
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:04,519
of the service and you're getting

914
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,960
Harvest under your belts and [ __ ] like

915
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:10,519
that uh maybe do maybe we could talk

916
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,318
about uh you know did you did you

917
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,480
eventually find you a crew to be a part

918
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,920
of did you eventually I mean how did you

919
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,440
figure out about breeder Syndicate uh

920
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,318
how' you figure out about Matt uh maybe

921
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,480
you could take us

922
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:28,119
there well so I actually like I read

923
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,838
about Matt um

924
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,920
long before you know back then in like

925
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:39,599
2011 2012 when I was when I was lurking

926
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:43,079
on uh Forums on uh like THC farmer was

927
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,960
where I mostly looked at stuff

928
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,640
um and like I you know I saw a [ __ ]

929
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,880
link to that whole

930
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:56,559
post uh and you know saw people arguing

931
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,960
back and forth over it [ __ ] like that um

932
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:02,480
and like at that point I knew that I

933
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,480
didn't know

934
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,199
enough to

935
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,240
even be able to figure out you know

936
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,279
who's telling the truth who you know any

937
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,559
of that [ __ ] so I just I was like well

938
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,960
I'm just not gonna get his

939
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:21,759
stuff um same I did the same with swerve

940
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:26,039
you know I was like H I'm seeing too

941
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,839
much like negative stuff and don't know

942
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:32,358
how to parse what's you know what's real

943
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:36,838
versus what's you know

944
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:38,199
someone having a a monetary reason for

945
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,880
saying the things they're

946
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:44,639
saying um you know I I still at that

947
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,599
point I was not

948
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:52,400
quite I didn't understand the value of

949
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,599
clones outside

950
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,119
of like

951
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:01,359
multiplication of of plants you know

952
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,838
right I didn't grasp the like oh no you

953
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:07,078
can keep this exact one like it took

954
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,759
after popping you know continuing to pop

955
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,839
seeds and taking clones from them and

956
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,160
stuff like that um just

957
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:17,318
to just to make more plants because I

958
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:22,000
was doing a sea green uh style like on a

959
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:25,318
flood table at the time MH so um you

960
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,358
know after two years of doing that I

961
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:31,079
started like oh man that one was

962
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:34,400
significantly better than than the other

963
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,760
ones even though they're all very much

964
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,519
you know they're probably [ __ ] s1's

965
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,920
of whatever they had growing that [ __ ]

966
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:47,199
up uh that the pounds were moved into

967
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,079
um

968
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:54,318
but like then I started to realize oh

969
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,839
you know like I can I can keep the good

970
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,800
one the quote unquote good one from the

971
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,838
bunch

972
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,000
um so yeah I did I just I knew that I

973
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:08,920
didn't know enough back then to even try

974
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,599
uh to to parse it so I just stayed away

975
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:16,880
which then ended up making me um buy

976
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:20,599
seeds from like places that were just

977
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,400
straight up [ __ ] um you know buying

978
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,280
the

979
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,400
greenhouse the the circular packs where

980
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,119
there's like [ __ ]

981
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,000
one seed of each thing in it you know

982
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,960
like not

983
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,519
understanding

984
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:41,280
um just not not getting it yet

985
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,679
um because they were the ones who didn't

986
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,280
have you know I thought that they had

987
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,199
the bonafides well of course everyone

988
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,079
knows about [ __ ] Greenhouse seed you

989
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,679
know like I didn't understand the Nuance

990
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,400
to it

991
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:56,118
yet well they also like when you I think

992
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,880
when you everybody starts off you think

993
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,200
like oh they said sell one seed at a

994
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,680
time like that's cool cuz like I got 400

995
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,000
bucks so I could get like one of each

996
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,519
seed bro and you think it's like or at

997
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
least I'm thinking like a tomato or

998
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,480
something where like you pop it and it

999
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,800
you'll get something good like

1000
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,838
consistent every time but like like you

1001
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,119
said I'm buying like crop Kings and or I

1002
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:21,159
love marijuana.com or whatever that type

1003
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,880
of [ __ ] and like it just yeah it

1004
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:24,838
wasn't working for me bro I wasn't

1005
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
excited about what I was growing like at

1006
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:28,880
the end of the runs like I was like what

1007
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,838
the [ __ ] is this like once I really

1008
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,480
started to to finish up runs and stuff I

1009
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,599
was just kind so now I will say there's

1010
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,960
been stuff that like white label seeds

1011
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,720
every once in a while you get a plant

1012
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,599
that was cool but yeah like that was

1013
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:45,159
rare but you know and you [ __ ] you

1014
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,519
just I know back then I would go on

1015
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,759
Google and just be like best marijuana

1016
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,599

1019
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,240
these forums and [ __ ] the only forums I

1020
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:02,079
really even paid attention to um was

1021
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,879
like I said 420 Chan and bro like they

1022
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,000
were on another level like there were

1023
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,760
some of the people on there kind of

1024
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,519
hateful and [ __ ] and like I don't know

1025
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,359
it was just wild on there so I didn't

1026
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,079

if I get on here and this is like you

1028
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,800

1029
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,039
was like man what if this is like all

1030

like you know gonna get me trouble on

1031
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:21,800
here or something so I didn't [ __ ] with

1032
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,838
that but so I watched a lot of the M

1033
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,720
like I said George santes and all that

1034
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,838
or Jorge savantes I always say George

1035
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,399
but Jorge santes and those dudes I would

1036
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:32,960
watch videos and YouTube came out like

1037
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,160
perfect timing then bro and there were

1038
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,519
starting to get people there were

1039
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:37,960
certain people starting to try to put

1040
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:41,400
[ __ ] on there I remember this

1041
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,800
video it was like some dude in like

1042
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,920
Amsterdam the guy didn't even talk it

1043
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,720
was just like uh or he wasn't talking it

1044
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,639
was somebody like dubbed over it and it

1045
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,679
was like him going through like a grow

1046
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,159
and like you know it was the old setups

1047
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,519
with like the HIDs and [ __ ] and I

1048
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:58,039
realized quickly like I'm not going to

1049
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,920
be able to [ __ ] can use those because

1050
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,960
like in my spaces were always small I'm

1051
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,280
like I'll burn my house down I didn't

1052
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,838
have the money didn't know anything

1053
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,800
about that [ __ ] so that's why I would

1054
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:10,799
started off with those [ __ ] little

1055
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,200
shitty ass 6500 uh CFL compact for

1056
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,920
Essence and all that

1057
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:21,480
[ __ ] yeah that was what I started on

1058
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:23,240
I ended up uh getting um back back in in

1059
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:28,920
God it was like

1060
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:32,000
07 uh it was right after those UFOs came

1061
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,440
out and um you know I saw it in High

1062
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,679
Times uh because I was I was a very

1063
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:42,400
proud owner of a high time

1064
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:44,078
subscription um and uh yeah I [ __ ]

1065
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,160
you know me and my friends hustled up

1066
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,640
the money 700 [ __ ] dollars to buy one

1067
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,318
and

1068
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:54,318
uh yeah you know I thought it would oh

1069
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,239
this will grow the entire [ __ ] thing

1070
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,838
this is going to be great and uh dude

1071
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:03,239
back then they didn't have there was

1072
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:06,318
like no it was just blue and

1073
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:08,039
red so when you would walk out when I'd

1074
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,759
walk out of the [ __ ] closet

1075
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:14,880
everything would be green and like melty

1076
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,960
like mushrooms almost yeah you know like

1077
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,480
[ __ ] it was very

1078
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,800
disorienting yeah um I remember I want

1079
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,440
to say I kept looking at the it was like

1080
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,680
the 150 watt or 100 watt uh h pressure

1081
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,639
sodium that I want to say that Mars

1082
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:34,358
Hydro [ __ ] made back then because I

1083
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,838
remember like on eBay and stuff you

1084
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:37,199
could like there was certain [ __ ] I

1085
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,480
remember getting on eBay and was able to

1086
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,358
find like grow tents and you know back

1087
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,559
then I was just how I stumbled on it and

1088
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:48,440
I remember like reading on like 420 Chan

1089
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:51,519
and [ __ ] like that uh about hpss and

1090
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,440
metal highlights and stuff like that but

1091
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:55,639
like I said like the heat restrictions

1092
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,960
and like my space I trying to figure out

1093
00:45:55,639 --> 00:46:00,199
how can I I kind of put two and two

1094
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,639
together at a certain point like compact

1095
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:04,598
frants are not going to give me like

1096
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,519
dense nugs and [ __ ] like you were saying

1097
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:09,760
earlier about wispy ass nugs and all

1098
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:11,199
[ __ ] and um so I realized at a certain

1099
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,319
point you know through Reading and doing

1100
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,399
research like yeah I need better lights

1101
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:18,318
and I seen that [ __ ] little little

1102
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,599
bitty like 100 watt uh like I said 100

1103
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,000
watt I think he had a ballast and all

1104
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,720
the [ __ ] and uh I was going to try to

1105
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,318
rig that up in like um uh a cabinet or

1106
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:29,919
some [ __ ] but I never ended up doing it

1107
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,480
and then I just ended up kind of falling

1108
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:37,760
away for a long time and flipping packs

1109
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:42,280
dude for years and it wasn't until like

1110
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:45,839
[ __ ] two years maybe before Co hit uh

1111
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:48,160
that I started growing like seriously or

1112
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,639
again or whatever [ __ ] with it again

1113
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,358
and uh for like two years bro I just

1114
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,318
brought like white labels and [ __ ] and

1115
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:57,799
then I came across like CSI on the

1116
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,199
[ __ ] some panel thing he did and then

1117
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,559
like a month or two later or something

1118
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,679
like that I [ __ ] saw Matt NATO on the

1119
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,240
uh Matt show I think it was like a

1120
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,558
recording of maybe like an IG show or

1121
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,078
something I don't really remember what

1122
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,319
an episode even was but for a long time

1123
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,480
I would watch just watch I because I'm

1124
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,880
like you bro you were talking about

1125
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,199
earlier about not trusting people and

1126
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,519
like is this dude for like monetary [ __ ]

1127
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:25,358
not not even particular but I was just

1128
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:27,199
kind of uh skeptical of people already

1129
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,119
because of like I'd already been in

1130
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,159
discords and [ __ ] with other people with

1131
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,680
like other hobbies and [ __ ] I was into

1132
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:35,440
at the time and I had like gotten like

1133
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,558
kind of ripped off and like I don't know

1134
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,159
just a lot of dumb drama and [ __ ] and

1135
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,400
I'm like you bro from the far I was just

1136
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:43,558
kind of like watching for a far and then

1137
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,358
I finally like I don't remember why but

1138
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,440
I was like man I think it was my old

1139
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,838
lady she was like you know why don't you

1140
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,358
join their Discord or whatever and just

1141
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:54,480
see what's going on no I remember it I I

1142
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,199
joined this other dude's Discord that I

1143
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,039
don't don't want to name on the podcast

1144
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,598
he's a [ __ ] little dwee but I didn't

1145
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,558
know anything like I I was just trying

1146
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,200
to find a community like we talked about

1147
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,800
earlier I'm in the country bro I'm

1148
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,719
wanting to connect with somebody or at

1149
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,318
least chat about it feeling a little bit

1150
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,799
more comfortable as times went on you

1151
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:15,960
know and uh I joined this Discord for

1152
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,839
literally like a day or two and they

1153
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,838
were weird in there bro like really

1154
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:23,358
[ __ ] weird and I I kind of already

1155
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:25,000
felt like this is sus so I left that and

1156
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,880
then literally I wasn't even going to

1157
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,960
try to join nothing again and she was

1158
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,680
like why don't you just try a different

1159
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,000
one one time and then I saw that mattx

1160
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,519
was like paid and I thought to myself

1161
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,318
like I P like you know you had to pay

1162
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,119
like five bucks or whatever to get in

1163
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,719
and I was like man maybe that'll like be

1164
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,039
enough to keep like the shitthe heads

1165
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,399
out and I'll actually be able to like

1166
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:46,558
get in here and chill you know and

1167
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,720
that's kind of how I ended up uh joining

1168
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:53,680
the Discord and [ __ ] you

1169
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:59,078
know yeah I uh dude because of that

1170
00:48:53,679 --> 00:49:02,639
um that experience before um I I I'd

1171
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:05,318
been you know started uh listening to

1172
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:10,239
podcasts and stuff like that uh I

1173
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:16,880
watched uh the uh Adam Dunn one uh quite

1174
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:20,759
a bit in like 2016 17 I think and um

1175
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,200
after uh when Co started that's when

1176
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:29,040
like everyone started you know really

1177
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:32,078
podcast streaming just a ton so so uh I

1178
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:35,358
started getting you know much more

1179
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:38,280
online uh there cuz everyone else kind I

1180
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:41,558
guess the regular people started normies

1181
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,519
started you know get getting online more

1182
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:47,040
uh

1183
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:48,719
too and um I had put off listening to

1184
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,079
the breeder Syndicate because like I saw

1185
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:54,399
it on my Spotify list and [ __ ] I was

1186
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:57,240
like ah no cuz I I'm not I'm still not

1187
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,400
sure I was still unsure and then

1188
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:02,279
you know finally I ran out of all new

1189
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,440
material to listen to um because I'd

1190
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,680
just be like cleaning the house [ __ ]

1191
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,559
you know running errands all that [ __ ]

1192
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:10,879
um just while listening to

1193
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,160
podcasts and

1194
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,240
uh I finally was like well [ __ ] there's

1195
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,960
nothing else to listen to I might as

1196
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:22,279
well I'll start this

1197
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:25,880
one and you know I I was hooked [ __ ]

1198
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,760
right away cuz things made sense you

1199
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,680
know like to where I was like man I

1200
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,119
wonder if this is

1201
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:35,159
why you know I'm not I still don't know

1202
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:39,079
[ __ ] you know

1203
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:42,000
like um and that you know that

1204
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:45,480
was it sucks because it you know I kind

1205
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,960
of like started to put together like you

1206
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,960
know oh man all this [ __ ] time I've

1207
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,639
wasted like

1208
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,639
learning stuff that isn't real you know

1209
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:01,078
like the learning the marketing

1210
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,960
essentially um which is cool and all

1211
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:06,760
whatever but

1212
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:10,960
like in terms of growing you end up

1213
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,319
not having a good grasp of things um you

1214
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,159
don't have good if you don't have good

1215
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,838
uh like reference

1216
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:20,838
points you're it's all [ __ ] useless

1217
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:23,920
information it's all just random

1218
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:27,519
um and that that was when I started like

1219
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,680
oh man you know like well let [ __ ]

1220
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,880
let me check this stuff out a little bit

1221
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:35,480
and I and I started popping you know

1222
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:39,720
like asking questions uh because it I

1223
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:42,280
ran out of all of the past

1224
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:47,519
episodes and saw

1225
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:50,240
that uh it's on IG live

1226
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,400
um so I started that's actually what

1227
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:55,318
made me start using

1228
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:59,000
Instagram was going to watch the

1229
00:51:55,318 --> 00:52:03,279
episodes and just like trying to trying

1230
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,199
to learn participate and [ __ ] yeah yeah

1231
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,880
um yeah

1232
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,239
man I think I got so lucky dude because

1233
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,838
like yeah I bought a bunch of white

1234
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,399
labels and [ __ ] I mean I wouldn't even

1235
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:14,838
say a bunch because at the time I had

1236
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,440
like one t so I'm popping and I was

1237
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:18,679
doing like you were doing I'm growing in

1238
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,440
like I think at the time like seven

1239
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:23,960
gallon [ __ ] fabric pots like four PL

1240
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,679
so they're getting big you know and and

1241
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,838
not to do my own horn or nothing but

1242
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:31,519
like those first few harvests that I did

1243
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,798
uh I'm not saying I've never had a bad

1244
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,400
one I've definitely had bad Harvest I

1245
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:37,119
had a bad one my last Harvest was

1246
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,000
terrible just because of [ __ ] thrips

1247
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,000
and [ __ ] but um and my dad being sick

1248
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,358
and [ __ ] I just like I was my head space

1249
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,880
was not uh you know I've talked to you

1250
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:47,480
about this before but my dad I thought

1251
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,160
he was about to pass away and [ __ ] he's

1252
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,358
going through a lot of [ __ ] so um I just

1253
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,598
like my grow and [ __ ] I just didn't give

1254
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:57,039
a [ __ ] about it so I trimmed it down to

1255
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:00,240
basically whatever was in hour at the

1256
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:03,318
time I finished it up and I had brought

1257
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:05,759
indoor stuff or outdoor [ __ ] in and

1258
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,519
lesson learned there bro did some of my

1259
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,240
trimming up inside and then literally

1260
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,679
like two or three weeks later I'm I got

1261
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,318
thrips in the in my garden you know in

1262
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:15,679
inside that's the only thing I could

1263
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,400
think of because I've been you know I've

1264
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:19,679
been growing for a good time a good good

1265
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,838
while and that's the first time I've

1266
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:26,199
ever had a real pest problem other than

1267
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:29,078
like some gats or something right um but

1268
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:31,719
I think I got lucky dude by something

1269
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:33,119
about CSI bro when I watched him on a

1270
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:34,480
panel one day because I was looking for

1271
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,960
information because I felt like I was

1272
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,760
tapped out I like I I started growing uh

1273
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,039
again and I like kind of was just doing

1274
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,760
it I knew I knew what how to grow like I

1275
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,400
said I [ __ ] around as a kid so it's

1276
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,440
like wasn't much to it like put the

1277
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,920
seeds in the ground water them but you

1278
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,880
know like every new grower I'm

1279
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,559
overwatering my [ __ ] doing stuff like

1280
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,119
you know not doing the greatest and uh

1281
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,519
watch I'm looking for information on

1282
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,519
more on how to grow better but also was

1283
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:04,400
curious about genetics because what

1284
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,480
really got me into this whole journey to

1285
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,920
like kind of look for guys like y'all

1286
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,119
and stuff was uh actually Grandaddy per

1287
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,559
and people [ __ ] on me but like that

1288
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,280
[ __ ] weed was the first some of the

1289
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,519
best uh I guess the first good weed I

1290
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,400
had ever really had bro and this was

1291
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:22,759
like right out of high school that

1292
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,920
particular weed was so good at its time

1293
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:30,040
for me that for up to like to the point

1294
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,200
I met uh my buddy's dad the dude I was

1295
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,440
recording music with I hadn't seen weed

1296
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:37,439
like that basically so and I'd seen that

1297
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,280
GDP like four or five times throughout

1298
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,358
the throughout my uh time doing what I

1299
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,798
was doing and then even the dude that I

1300
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,838
ended up [ __ ] with for like 10 years

1301
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:50,159
he ended up getting that same GDP but

1302
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:52,199
like uh that I wanted to experience that

1303
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,879
again because it's like we talk about it

1304
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:55,798
on the show or Matt does and in the

1305
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,200
Discord like sometimes you smoke [ __ ]

1306
00:54:55,798 --> 00:55:00,440
back then it's not what you really think

1307
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,919
it was or maybe you just your memory of

1308
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,358
it was terrible but like I feel like I'm

1309
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,559
so familiar with that because I smoked

1310
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:08,798
it so many times over the years bro and

1311
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,640
I was buying like whenever that came

1312
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:11,798
dude I would get a pound of it bro and

1313
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,639
like I said before I would normally be

1314
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:16,239
[ __ ] with like QPS half pounds but

1315
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,759
when I see when that came I would get a

1316
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,199
pound of it so I could have it and I

1317
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,960
could smoke it and I can just remember

1318
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:23,558
it and I will always remember it and it

1319
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,400
always look the same it always smell the

1320
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:26,839
same I always smoked the same one of

1321
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,039
those few weeds you could smoke at the

1322
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,199
time for me and mind you I'm smoking all

1323
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,119
day long this is my job bro like every

1324
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,639

1326
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,759
want to smoke a blunt with you bro and

1327
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:41,119
so I'm playing video games and Super

1328
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,520
Smash Bros and selling selling [ __ ]

1329
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,599
half quarters and quarters and Zips all

1330
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,119
day right and uh that GDP sent me on

1331
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:50,519
that mission bro because I had popped

1332
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,960
some from uh I love growing

1333
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:56,559
marijuana.com and it was [ __ ] like

1334
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,519
not even close bro I was like what the

1335
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:02,720
[ __ ] this is not even close so it made

1336
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:05,599
me wonder like you know what is going on

1337
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:07,919
so yeah like I started looking for that

1338
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,200
like using that term like GDP actually

1339
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,720
searching for that I came across the

1340
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,519
[ __ ] Ken stuff and something about

1341
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,318
all that I was just like dude this don't

1342
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:19,038

1343
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:20,798
like these rapper dudes and like I I

1344
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,319
just was like really confused by all

1345
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,400
that the Ken what is his EST I always

1346
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:28,239
forget his last name EST yeah and you

1347
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,039
know I don't whatever and I'm like dude

1348
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,558
I don't know and I started watching them

1349
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:34,880
panels with CSI and you know how he is

1350
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,599
he's real humble and the way he talks

1351
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,519
about [ __ ] I don't feel like he was

1352
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,318
trying to sell me something it was like

1353
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:43,440
the first person I had seen that was

1354
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:45,079
like man I feel like he's and he's

1355
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,559
talking about how he's been doing it in

1356
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:50,519
his family for you know whatever it was

1357
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:53,559
30 or 40 years 40 years and I was like

1358
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:56,239
if anybody [ __ ] knows this guy knows

1359
00:56:53,559 --> 00:57:00,079
but I go and look at his website bro and

1360
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:02,439
and I'm like oh man this dude look like

1361
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,559
this is a scam dude right here bro look

1362
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,519
at this [ __ ] right dude I thought the

1363
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,280
same [ __ ] thing about I was like no

1364
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:13,119
I'm not getting that there's no way he's

1365
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,400
got all of these things and look at this

1366
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,358
[ __ ]

1367
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,400
website cash only I'm sitting here

1368
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,798
thinking like what the [ __ ] bro and at

1369
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,838
this point it's it's been like it just

1370
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:27,119
like opened up Medical in like Colorado

1371
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:29,599
or recreational and think like Michigan

1372
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,880
was coming up or like I don't know it

1373
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,440
somewhere in between all this [ __ ] and

1374
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,240
uh and that's another reason why I was

1375
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,400
back in in it too because these places

1376
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:39,639
were going wreck and uh I was going and

1377
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,760
visiting them I went out to Colorado and

1378
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:44,679
I went out to uh Michigan a couple

1379
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,680
different places over the years as stuff

1380
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:48,719
has come online and I always thought it

1381
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:50,519
was so funny dude that the black market

1382
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,838
weed that I brought with me to get me

1383
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:54,318
there was often better some than the

1384
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:57,078
[ __ ] I was getting from some of these

1385
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:59,239
places and I was like the experience was

1386
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:00,480
still cool but at the time some of those

1387
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:02,838
places would have like four or five

1388
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,358
strains or or cultivars whatever [ __ ]

1389
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:07,599
you want to call it and uh yeah it just

1390
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,199
wasn't it wasn't what I was expecting

1391
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,519
now like when I went to Colorado that

1392
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,358
was just a dope trip in general because

1393
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,400
it was beautiful bro like we went and

1394
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:18,838
did like a lot of [ __ ] we went to like

1395
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:21,639
Red Rocks we went to like um uh couple

1396
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:23,199
other other spots went to like rock and

1397
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:25,000
mineral show that they have this big

1398
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,159
massive one and that was cool because

1399
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,920
I'm you know I'm getting High legally

1400
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:31,038
pretty much walking around that was cool

1401
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,280
that was like the first the experience

1402
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,000
of like going somewhere and not being

1403
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,640
like pursued or feel like you have to be

1404
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,519
careful and like look over your shoulder

1405
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:43,279
was like a a a breath of fresh air and

1406
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,159
as time is went on you know over the

1407
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,480
years when I got the opportunity to move

1408
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:50,798
up here to Michigan bro and just do [ __ ]

1409
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:53,880
legally and not worry uh I took it bro

1410
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:56,318
because I was like man like I made it

1411
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,838
for so many like that time I got held up

1412
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,480
and Rob that was like my only time

1413
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,838
knocking wood didn't never have any

1414
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,119
other problems you know getting caught

1415
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:05,358
up or anything so I looked at it that as

1416
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,559
like a sign and and I I met her years

1417
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,639
ago and and I you know I got out of

1418
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:12,480
doing all that [ __ ] years ago I just

1419
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,239
don't have a need for it and really man

1420
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,960
like you know as years went on the

1421
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:20,679
market the black in black market even

1422
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,960
it's tanked and um so like the way I had

1423
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:25,480
operated for years like back then was

1424
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,240
having the best of the best and once

1425
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,960
everybody had access and even the dude I

1426
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,318
was talking about for like 10 years

1427
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,079
eventually even he had like all cookies

1428
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,639
all you know gelato all the [ __ ] like it

1429
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:39,960
was all everybody had the same thing and

1430
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:42,358
then like basically my advantage in my

1431
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:46,039
market uh was gone because everybody

1432
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,960
else had had the same exact [ __ ] so and

1433
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,640
you see it you see the disappointment in

1434
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,079
my I saw the disappointment in the

1435
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:53,440
quality with even my customers because

1436
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,880
like these are all the same channels

1437
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,798
that I'm getting the same [ __ ] from

1438
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,160
right that I have for years

1439
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,798
but they're complaining that it's not

1440
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,838
getting them high or like it's bunk and

1441
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,119
it's of course it's like runs or some

1442
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:06,679
Skittles or whatever you know whatever

1443
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,480
it was you know and who knows if that's

1444
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:11,078
what it actually was but like it got to

1445
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,519
the point where I wasn't even having fun

1446
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:16,200
anymore and it wasn't easy anymore and

1447
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,880
you know you could still get I don't

1448
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:21,439
know I would say probably 150 close to

1449
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:26,079
200 depending on what you got but that

1450
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:28,358
that Norm is probably like 75 to 120 25

1451
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,880
like for a zip in Kentucky now and

1452
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:34,880
that's like basically you're getting

1453
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:37,200
Oreos or lava cakes or [ __ ] like

1454
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,960
that yeah that's pretty much how it is

1455
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,598
here I

1456
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,079
mean

1457
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:49,680
it's it's [ __ ] pitiful honestly yeah

1458
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:52,519
know it's like God damn I I uh see it

1459
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:55,558
um you know I still keep in touch with

1460
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:57,239
people and and watch uh what's going on

1461
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,680
and stuff

1462
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:03,558
and uh [ __ ] the game's just gotten so

1463
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:06,159
[ __ ] diluted

1464
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:09,760
um to where now it

1465
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:12,838
is and I'm sure there was like there was

1466
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,880
that to a degree um back in the day of

1467
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:16,558
people just shopping based on price

1468
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,240
points

1469
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:23,280
um but I don't I don't know how it was

1470
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:27,519
out there but out here uh we had like a

1471
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,000
tier system basically where

1472
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,000
it was either

1473
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,798
schwag baby Dro or

1474
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,719
Dro and like within those three tiers

1475
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:39,719
the price can change a little bit up or

1476
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:42,558
down whatever

1477
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:46,838
um

1478
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:49,119
but there was not a oh this is this is

1479
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:52,159
more fire than the last batch every

1480
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:55,400
single [ __ ] batch there wasn't as

1481
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:57,838
many people pretending to have better

1482
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,838
weed

1483
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,519
um you know the weed he had was like

1484
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:09,559
literally you gota imagine right so I'm

1485
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:12,798
in a small town of maybe 15,000 people

1486
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:17,480
and in that town for years the reged

1487
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:20,599
trade was dominated by cartels and they

1488
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,719
would basically distribute um between

1489
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:26,039
two guys two main guys and those guys

1490
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:28,318
would distribute to the younger guys and

1491
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:30,559
basically in the projects in government

1492
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:36,038
housing and stuff like that and that

1493
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:39,400
those were the dealers and um you know

1494
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:42,039
with his weed was just so much better

1495
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,079
bro like no you know there was a tier

1496
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,119
system kind of for a while I would say

1497
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,440
this was before I met him but it was

1498
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:51,240
more like people started calling [ __ ]

1499
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:55,200
like $10 a gram but or 10 bud or they

1500
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:57,479
would say uh oh this shit's $15 a gram

1501
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:59,480
or 15 Grand but or they would say hey

1502
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,960
hey I got Reggie I got [ __ ] that's like

1503
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,358
$10 and I got [ __ ] that's like 15 but

1504
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,838
that was only like for like a year or

1505
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:07,358
two at a certain point I remember this

1506
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,960
one dude I started [ __ ] with that I

1507
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:12,679
met at this Factory where I was working

1508
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,240
and he was getting [ __ ] like I want to

1509
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:18,759
say it was like Fruity Pebbles like blue

1510
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:19,919
dream uh I can't really remember the

1511
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,599
other names other than that I just

1512
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,599
remember those two in particular it was

1513
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,000
always something different each time but

1514
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,039
that was just like people started

1515
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,480
calling that like row or kush or like it

1516
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:33,200
was a lot of stupid little names but um

1517
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,639
yeah I mean that was only like a year or

1518
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:35,719
two where they had like that tier system

1519
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,118
and then it got to a point where it was

1520
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:40,278
just like $20 a grand bud but there were

1521
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:41,798
still a lot of people those people I was

1522
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:43,760
telling you about the distributed to

1523
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:46,599
everybody they were still trying to pass

1524
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,400
their [ __ ] off though as like $20 a gram

1525
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:51,440
type or three $400 ounce type [ __ ] but

1526
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,798
it wasn't really worth that especially

1527
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,440
when I brought uh when started hooking

1528
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:57,920
me up with all the [ __ ] it was like a

1529
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,880
whole different level because he had

1530
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,200
money you know he worked a really good

1531
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,680
job and he hustled he had he had money

1532
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,439
money you know what I'm saying so uh he

1533
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,919
was trying to get the best [ __ ] bro and

1534
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,440
he was getting weight and he was getting

1535
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,440
like it wasn't just like it was the

1536
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,240
first time I went to a dude that was

1537
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,318
like it wasn't just one thing of each

1538
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:22,479
like different price point it was like

1539
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:23,960
yo like this is all this price and I

1540
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,639
have all these varieties that you can

1541
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,599
choose from right any like basically any

1542
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,679
amount I could probably ever want you

1543
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:33,880
know and

1544
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:35,358
um uh yeah so there wasn't really much

1545
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,318
of a tiar system other than like I was

1546
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:40,000
saying 10 bud or 15 a bu bud or whatever

1547
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,558
but after a while everyone was just

1548
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,480
trying to do 20 a gram because you know

1549
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,880
gramming it out dude [ __ ]

1550
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:50,400
sucked uh you know time TimeWise because

1551
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,599
I could I don't know and when you're in

1552
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,039
a a place where it's illegal still you

1553
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:56,920
don't want traffic like that so like

1554
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,200
you're charging people for you know and

1555
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,680
the more you buy you get the discount

1556
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:05,318
obviously so yeah I mean I

1557
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:10,798
would $20 gone away

1558
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:14,000
too yeah I remember when uh ah man so I

1559
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:18,599
had a friend who uh was getting in you

1560
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,719
know he he was the the uh broker

1561
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:22,599
essentially

1562
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:26,038
um getting

1563
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:29,200
in very large quantities at least you

1564
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:32,240

1565
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:34,118
um and then like me and and the rest of

1566
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,479
my friends would [ __ ] boom you know

1567
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:40,400

um

1572
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:52,159
and that dude when he started get in

1573
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:55,038
order to to gain Market capture he did

1574
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,838
the same price all the it's like well

discount bro if you went up to the p and

1584
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,278

like my my customer base they were kind

1586
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:27,798

pee in a week pretty pretty quickly but

1591
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,359
like I I try to avoid people that wanted

1592
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:40,599
weight because I always thought to

1593
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,159
myself like those are the [ __ ]

1594

1599
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,838
younger real young dudes and I stayed

1600
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,519
away from other dealers for the most

1601
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:01,838
part as best I could you know like I got

1602
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:04,038
held up because I had because I decided

1603
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:06,239
to have a partner and my partner is

1604
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:08,319

situation that first time you know or

1606
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:13,719
the that that time or whatever so um I

1607
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,000
was just like after that after that I'm

1608

01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:11,598
um yeah that now that's just that's

1630
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:13,078
standard [ __ ] practice out here yeah

1631
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,318
I wouldn't know bro that was all that

1632
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:16,759
[ __ ] like [ __ ] all behind me but uh I

1633
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:18,278
I'll catch up with but when I went down

1634
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:21,479
to Kentucky not too long ago I went and

1635
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:24,480
hung and and he's still up to his old

1636
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:26,919
chick um now I mean I could get [ __ ]

1637
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:31,198
obviously extreme cheap I smoked some of

1638
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:32,719
their [ __ ] and uh you know it it

1639
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,318
literally was like lava cake or

1640
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,079
something like that and I was just I

1641
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,400
smoked it and I'm just because I didn't

1642
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:39,158
really bring any weed with me because I

1643
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:41,479
gotta go down through Indiana bro when I

1644
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:43,719
go down there and I'm just like they're

1645
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:46,718
everywhere bro in Indiana like on this

1646
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:48,838
highway with uh lasers speed checks all

1647
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,679
that [ __ ] so it's like I usually bring

1648
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,679
like maybe like a half quarter with me

1649
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:55,560
and you know or or sometimes not even

1650
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,279
anything just because I'm like bro it's

1651
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,440
you know it's not worth getting pulled

1652
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:01,319
over to just for some weed bro like I

1653

1656
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:09,120
older and got you know a old lady and I

1657
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,559
don't do that kind of [ __ ] no more bro

1658
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:14,358

1659
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,759
my dude was like that too bro like I

1660
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:19,560

1681
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:19,000
currently smoking some garbage Cloud um

1682
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:23,119
which is Shoreline by Santa Cruz Blue

1683
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:27,920
Dream from pack at Santa Cruz goat

1684
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:30,920
farm uh this is from my second run um

1685
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,480
I'm going to have to do a third with

1686
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,640
three of the Clones because I still

1687
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:39,359
can't

1688
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:43,400
pick um they're very good

1689
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:45,158
uh definitely what I was hoping for like

1690
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:46,599
more than I could have asked for out of

1691
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:49,079
that pack

1692
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,480
honestly um what were the garbage clouds

1693
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:53,960
again for people the cross for people

1694
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:57,079
who maybe not know anything about it

1695
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,319
Shoreline by Santa Blue Dream yeah I

1696
01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:02,039
think maybe you said that bro I'm

1697
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,039
[ __ ] bake my bad I

1698
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:11,279
did but yeah but it's it's [ __ ]

1699
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:12,759
killer killer killer what uh what's the

1700
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:14,960
T like what kind of flavors are you

1701
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,840
getting on it in the in the the smoke

1702
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:22,000
how's the

1703
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:24,840
smoke uh so in pretty much all of them

1704
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,640
uh they had very good representations of

1705
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,760
both par

1706
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:36,199
um on that first that first run of them

1707
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:38,760
uh I could only cut out two um just due

1708
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:41,519
to and it's not because they weren't

1709
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,880
good it's because they weren't as potent

1710
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,199
as the other

1711
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:49,560
five

1712
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:54,079
um so yeah really good expressions from

1713
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:56,039
both parents uh I am I'm liking the

1714
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:59,960
shoreline leaners

1715
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:02,479
more and that may be because I am a bit

1716
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,239
biased uh when it comes to that cut

1717
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:09,119
because that that's like

1718
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:11,039
a it's a pretty pivotal cut for like my

1719
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:14,880
development as a smoker like that's what

1720
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:18,639
got me to you know make the switch from

1721
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,560
not smoking swag anymore and only buying

1722
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,520
you know good

1723
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:26,080
weed

1724
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:29,080
uh and I

1725
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:31,279
so you know it might be that um but I

1726
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:35,158
tend to like the shoreline leaners more

1727
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:39,119
they are the potency on them is [ __ ]

1728
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:41,559
fantastic um there's a couple where the

1729

I'm not kidding you bro I have to go up

1796
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,119
flights of stairs and [ __ ] so I have

1797
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,759
spent probably a day and a half up

1798
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:11,599
potting like two to three tents just

1799
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:13,440
because I have to uh clean them up I

1800
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,159
took them downstairs cleaned them up and

1801
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,839
obviously I've been trying to like uh do

1802
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:21,399
my soil [ __ ] outside or just downstairs

1803
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,360
or a different place uh obviously just

1804
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:25,079
to keep the you know the air clean as

1805
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:26,920
possible and [ __ ] because I mean you you

1806
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,920
mix up your soil and [ __ ] Bro in your

1807
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,079
room with your grow plants and [ __ ] or

1808
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,840
with your your grow room you got [ __ ]

1809
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:35,559
[ __ ] going airborne and everything so uh

1810
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,840
especially like if it's real dry uh some

1811

01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:48,239
I don't need to I'm not trying

1904
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:51,199
to I'm not trying to do that kind of

1905
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:53,198
work you know I don't have I don't I

1906
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,799
don't see myself as having like the

1907
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:58,759
space really to

1908
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:02,400
be dealing with all of that while

1909
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:04,639
I'm and still be able to like go through

1910
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,599
the stuff that I want to go through

1911
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:11,800
because that's that's like that's where

1912
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:14,480
my strength is is just uh being used to

1913
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:17,960
sea of green growing from when I was you

1914
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:22,919
know doing the flood table growing

1915
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:25,639
and that's what I do now to look through

1916
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:28,158
like my space I'll I'll put it this way

1917
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:31,039
my space probably

1918
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:34,158
seems much bigger than it is whenever I

1919
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:37,158
talk about it um just because of like

1920
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:41,198
the amount of stuff that I pop and the

1921
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:43,799
the stuff that like I'm going through um

1922
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:48,198
each time I flower it's just because I

1923
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:51,840
keep I keep stuff small and I uh do

1924
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:55,119
denser planting with it

1925
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,639
because I'm trying to see

1926
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:00,238
I'm trying to find the good one that I

1927
01:21:57,639 --> 01:22:03,199
can dedicate the whole Space to just

1928
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:07,799
growing that one you

1929
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:10,960
know yeah yeah man no I get you dude I

1930
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:14,079
uh I like I like to make seeds dude for

1931
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:17,840
one I I enjoy the process of it in

1932
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:20,639
general um I think two as I've gotten

1933
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,360
more involved with breeder Syndicate uh

1934
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,159
you know and the guys in there a lot of

1935
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:25,119
like Matt's work and a few of the other

1936
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:27,638
guys

1937
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:32,238
uh especially like H&amp;L he has uh like

1938
01:22:27,639 --> 01:22:36,159
most of his [ __ ] are all regs and um you

1939
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:38,000
know I really love this [ __ ] dude like

1940
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,599
whether it's a female or a male plant I

1941
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,158
treat them the same for the most part I

1942
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,480
put grow them in the same pots and stuff

1943
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:44,679
unless I'll recognize one really early

1944
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:47,399
sometimes I'll take a mail and grow it

1945
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:49,760
in a smaller pot so like a lot of times

1946
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:51,960
I'm wasting some materials probably

1947
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,280
inputs that I probably don't need to but

1948
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:58,439
I got it there already and they're handy

1949
01:22:55,279 --> 01:23:00,599
so like for me I got space so I can move

1950
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:02,678
it off to another place or take it

1951
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,840
outside and by the time they're dumping

1952
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:06,199
you know you only need them for a few

1953
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,239
days collect a little bit of pollen and

1954
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:10,839
then you dust a little bit just here and

1955
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:13,759
there and then for me like I have a seed

1956
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:15,520
addiction bro like I I for for a solid

1957
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,960
year there when I first joined the the

1958
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:22,199
Discord bro I was buying like seeds like

1959
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:24,239
every [ __ ] week and dude like crazy

1960
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:26,799
amounts and I know we all go through

1961
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,678
that [ __ ] bro but I like for me I found

1962
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,800
if like I just dust a little bit and

1963
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:32,840
just I know like I'm not I don't sell

1964
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,760
weed so like finding a seed or two here

1965
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:37,400
or there uh like for me it's not really

1966
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,880
like a problem or whatever so I don't

1967
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:44,879
and I don't mind it and uh so for me I I

1968
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:46,880
like it too because it's uh it's already

1969
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,560
there I already got usually have

1970
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,319
multiple males on on on hand I don't

1971
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:54,440
have any expectation from it and then

1972
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,719
also being a part of the community bro

1973
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:58,678
bro so many people give me free [ __ ]

1974
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,359
like in the beginning I was so many

1975
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:02,158
people were giving me free seeds and

1976
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:03,279
[ __ ] that I felt weird I'm so weird

1977
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:05,238
about that bro I don't know if it's like

1978
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:07,359
the country country in me or whatever

1979
01:24:05,238 --> 01:24:09,319
but like where I'm from like nobody has

1980
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,839
anything so it's like when you when

1981
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:12,759
someone gives you something it means a

1982
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,880
lot CU they're probably giving up

1983
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,800
something that they actually probably

1984
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:18,800
need to give you or need themselves but

1985
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,960
they're giving it to you so like that's

1986
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,199
just how we were raised so like if

1987
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,719
somebody does something for you I don't

1988
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:25,678
like feeling like I owe anybody anything

1989
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:29,000
so for me like I don't want to send

1990
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,880
people weed bro it's like kind of sketch

1991
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,039
so for me like sending some seeds of

1992
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,480
what you know what some Chuck or

1993
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:36,639
whatever I did if they don't pop it like

1994
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,118
whatever like I don't give a [ __ ] like

1995
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:41,000
it's just something to share and uh like

1996
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:43,079
yeah it's like almost like currency for

1997
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,319
me in a way like that where it's like

1998
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:50,479
you know and two another thing which has

1999
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:52,880
been awesome is like Matt does the uh 50

2000
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:55,158
tier where he gives like seeds out like

2001
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,800
a pack a month quarterly

2002
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:58,079
and there's been there's been times

2003
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,039
where like maybe he didn't because

2004
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:03,238
that's all like donations and stuff from

2005
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:05,238
like the guys basically so like being

2006
01:25:03,238 --> 01:25:06,919
able to like contribute to that dude I

2007
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:08,879
don't know it's like a mini dream for me

2008
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:12,079
bro like just hanging out like going

2009
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,679
through the processes of like taking a

2010
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:17,399
plant that you like and then even if you

2011
01:25:14,679 --> 01:25:19,000
don't really know a whole lot like just

2012
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:21,879
smashing them together and just like for

2013
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,319
me put like last year for example I took

2014
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:28,480
the I'm slowly getting through [ __ ] off

2015
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:31,679
chucked so last year I ran the uh I

2016
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:35,479
think it was Space Invaders uh creamy

2017
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:38,199
punch uh I guess Matt selection whatever

2018
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:41,238
uh but the creamy punch uh had chucked

2019
01:25:38,198 --> 01:25:43,158
some appy F3 Paul and male pollen a

2020
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:44,879
couple years ago like it was like right

2021
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:46,920
when I joined the Discord and I was

2022
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,359
trying to learn about like breeding and

2023
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,840
seeds and all this [ __ ] because that's

2024
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:52,759
what that's what I was interested

2025
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,880
especially at the time and uh I chucked

2026
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:59,400
some appies onto like a bunch of [ __ ]

2027
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:01,880
from the Discord like uh pox atw or the

2028
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:05,238
train his train train wreck

2029
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:07,719
s1's um the triangle

2030
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:09,559
choke uh and a a couple other ones but

2031
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:12,639
long story short I ran the triangle

2032
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:16,159
choke cross the Appalachia F3 and then I

2033
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:19,279
ran the creamy punch across to the

2034
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:20,799
Appalachia F3 Outdoors last year I had a

2035
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:23,920
jar I actually have a jar of it sitting

2036
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:27,239
over here um and uh just being able to

2037
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:30,440
try out was awesome bro like and what I

2038
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:32,879
found is like that weed was just as good

2039
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:34,799
as like any other [ __ ] weed I had ran

2040
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,000
dude it was awesome like I don't know

2041
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,239
like and it was outdoor low inputs I

2042
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,359
didn't do soil I barely gave it I didn't

2043
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:43,759
even really feed them I gave it some cow

2044
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,960
mag and I this is my first year being up

2045
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,760
in Michigan so I wanted to try just

2046
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:51,439
straight into soil and see what what

2047
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,280
would happen and even like that I still

2048
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,678
got a good harvest I mean that triangle

2049
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:57,158
choke cross it molded like a

2050
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:59,840
[ __ ] anything I had that was

2051
01:26:57,158 --> 01:27:01,799
purple molded out dude PM all over it

2052
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,440

2053
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,679
purple dank you know it was nice the

2054
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:09,399
structure was nice smelled it was good

2055
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:10,760
it was dank all the [ __ ] but you know I

2056
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:12,759
couldn't smoke it or didn't want to

2057
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,639
smoke it so end up throwing it out of

2058
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,000
the

2059
01:27:13,639 --> 01:27:19,639

2061
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:24,520
[ __ ] growing up bro so like I know it

2062
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,440
sounds dumb as [ __ ] but like uh in that

2063
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:28,400
game you could get like shiny stuff and

2064
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:30,198
hunt and like breed stuff and like get

2065
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:33,519
crosses of stuff and something about

2066
01:27:30,198 --> 01:27:36,399
that like the unknown any my point is is

2067
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:39,199
I enjoy like the unknowns or whatever so

2068
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:41,238
like for like the stuff I've chucked

2069
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:42,678
before I'm not proud about or think

2070
01:27:41,238 --> 01:27:45,638
they're cool really or anything like

2071

2072
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:51,840
thinking to myself like damn the skunk

2073
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:53,880

2074
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:58,199
these other things that I've I've ran

2075
01:27:53,880 --> 01:28:01,480

2086
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:31,599
uh TP talk or description of this kind

2087
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,840
of stuff but but it was just raunchiness

2088
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,960
dude like fermentation not like Fruity

2089
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,520
or nothing just like raw raunchiness

2090
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,480
dude like and almost like uh some of the

2091
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:44,080
[ __ ] that I Grew From or some of it

2092
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:45,839
almost kind of smelled like I don't know

2093
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:49,399
being where you're from maybe you

2094
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,719
visited the gulf and like you smell

2095
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:51,719
there's like kind of this almost like

2096
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,560
rotten

2097
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:56,800
seaweed uh smell sometimes especially in

2098
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,760
the mornings when the Todd comes in kind

2099
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,840
of smell like that bro and it was just

2100
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:06,920
right up my alley bro so if I could get

2101
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:08,840
something like that in a Chuck bro and

2102
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,560
not have to like Fork out because you

2103
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,880
know bro if you want to find anything

2104
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,280
good you most likely you need to pop a

2105
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:18,480
couple packs and dude that [ __ ] adds up

2106
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:21,158
and I'm a little seed addict so I can't

2107
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:24,118
I can't keep up with uh purchasing you

2108
01:29:21,158 --> 01:29:25,559
know $100 packs every every week so for

2109
01:29:24,118 --> 01:29:28,679
for me it's it's as simple as that

2110
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:32,400
saving money and yeah just having

2111
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:34,359
something to do and I'm ADHD bro so like

2112
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:37,039
the more [ __ ] I keep myself doing and

2113
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:39,639
busy uh the better and something that I

2114
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:42,479
found really interesting uh was [ __ ]

2115
01:29:39,639 --> 01:29:44,960
around with the Autos bro is like

2116
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,319
pollinating like uh I don't know the

2117
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,960
scientific uh terminologies for this

2118
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:51,000
stuff first signs of like your sex and

2119
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,158
stuff especially like on your females

2120
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,679
you get that first little white hair

2121
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,279
that comes out but the my point is I was

2122
01:29:54,679 --> 01:29:58,840
able to pollinate those specific things

2123
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:00,559
with one seed bro and was able to

2124
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:03,319
pollinate the actual buds with a

2125
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:06,360
different pollen and like obviously if

2126
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:07,599
you're selling seeds or you know if

2127
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:10,039
you're worried about contamination

2128
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:14,119
that's [ __ ] [ __ ] but the way I

2129
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:18,519
did it was I had Max blueberry ex

2130
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:22,519
right a male and I hit it to Blueberry

2131
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:25,760
ex females I had some blueberry Autos

2132
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:28,280
outside so I took some pollen and I

2133
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:31,360
dusted those little little just those

2134
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:35,880
little pre flowers and it took and then

2135
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:39,319
like literally a week later I um I had a

2136
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:41,480
male Auto of some kind I forget like

2137
01:30:39,319 --> 01:30:43,639
some kind of what it doesn't matter but

2138
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:45,759
I hit that to the actual main buds as

2139
01:30:43,639 --> 01:30:47,279
they as they start to fully come in and

2140
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,760
I'm just now going through those to see

2141
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,118
if they actually if it worked because uh

2142
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,360
you know I'm curious if you could do

2143
01:30:51,118 --> 01:30:54,000
that like I don't think you could do

2144
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:55,759
that or want to do that with like your

2145
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,960
traditional plants but that was just

2146
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,480
something I thought that was really cool

2147
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,560
about the Autos in particular was just

2148
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:03,678
being able to like for my own personal

2149
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,520
stash just uh I was able to do multiple

2150
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:07,760
hits to it you know I don't know I

2151
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,880
thought that was cool and what what was

2152
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,960
neat about that is like when I run the

2153
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:14,639
the ones that I think are crossed to a

2154
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,000
non-auto obviously if they don't Auto

2155
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,880
flow then it worked and then obviously

2156
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,079
the ones that I crossed to the the bud

2157
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,400
the auto to Auto when they start pre

2158
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:23,960
when they start to flower within a you

2159
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,559
know three or four weeks I know they're

2160
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,560
actually Auto so it's pretty easy to

2161
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,159
determine you know which one wasn't or

2162
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,840
whatever but I don't know just a fun

2163
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:34,399
experiment I like to

2164
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:38,800
do yeah I mean

2165
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:41,000
I so to be clear I probably am going to

2166
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,320
do

2167
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:48,158
uh like seed

2168
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:52,118
projects um but yeah it's going to be

2169
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:56,319
you know just for me to like you said

2170
01:31:52,118 --> 01:31:59,839
just to like look at stuff also so um

2171
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:02,118
I'm going through all these uh Shoreline

2172
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:06,000
hybrids

2173
01:32:02,118 --> 01:32:07,599
and uh I probably in a couple of years

2174
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,920
going to try and

2175
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:14,679
reverse

2176
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:18,480
uh Shore back onto those Keepers just so

2177
01:32:14,679 --> 01:32:20,920
that so I have a uh you know in case

2178
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:24,000
something happens I have a little little

2179
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,239
bit of a seed backup to be able to you

2180
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,359
know pop

2181
01:32:25,238 --> 01:32:33,479
out what I like about Shoreline

2182
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:37,118
again I I think it was either farmer Dan

2183
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:39,399
or uh Kush the giant that said uh and

2184
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:42,479
this was on a podcast with Matt that he

2185
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:44,319
said he wished he had you know a lot of

2186
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:47,799
those guys operate with clones out there

2187
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:49,639
only and um he said that he wish he had

2188
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,159
just Chuck something over the years I

2189
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:53,359
forget what particular plan he was

2190
01:32:51,158 --> 01:32:54,599
talking about but he said he wish he had

2191
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:56,359
Chuck something over the years because

2192
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,560
he ended up losing that cut and didn't

2193
01:32:56,359 --> 01:33:00,118
have any seeds of any kind of it and I

2194
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,800
think it's important to say for people

2195
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:03,799
who are watching like just because you

2196
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,159
cross two plants together don't mean

2197
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,000
you're exactly going to get uh a

2198
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:10,198
representation of like a particular

2199
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,079
plant in there but that you know there's

2200
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:15,678
the odds that you can find and and like

2201
01:33:13,079 --> 01:33:19,960
for example when I crossed the the uh

2202
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:22,920
creamy punch to the Appalachia f3s it

2203
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:25,359
was interesting because I could see the

2204
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:28,920
the Appalachia that I used to do the the

2205
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:31,118
original uh pollination was u a really

2206
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,920
tropical one it had a little bit of

2207
01:33:31,118 --> 01:33:34,719
mango like as like two or three months

2208
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,399
into the Cure but not much mango at all

2209
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,359
it was more like this real tropically

2210
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:42,279
like reminded me like a tropically kind

2211
01:33:38,359 --> 01:33:44,158
of drink and when I that creamy punch

2212
01:33:42,279 --> 01:33:45,679
kind of like really just like

2213
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:48,118
personified that and brought it out and

2214
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:49,880
made it a little bit more smooth but you

2215
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:52,799
know you can definitely that being said

2216
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:54,359
you definitely can get some sort of idea

2217
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,560
from some stuff sometimes but yeah I

2218
01:33:54,359 --> 01:33:58,359
mean like an S I know a lot of people

2219
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:01,039
will buy s1's and I've done this myself

2220
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:02,639
thinking like oh man like this is like

2221
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:04,639
inting the cut you know we talk about

2222
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:07,239
this in the Discord and it's not always

2223
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,679
the case obviously so I think yeah we

2224
01:34:07,238 --> 01:34:12,479
actually we just talked about this today

2225
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:16,039
in the in the Discord server

2226
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:18,079
um yeah no I feel you and that's uh you

2227
01:34:16,039 --> 01:34:22,439
know that was what I was telling telling

2228
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:25,840
that guy um I don't necessarily want an

2229
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:30,039
exact carbon copy even if you know like

2230
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:33,800
which is it is not likely with you know

2231
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:36,880
s1's depending on what what the actual

2232
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:40,880
um clone being like reversed onto itself

2233
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:43,600
is um right because it's gonna it's re

2234
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,400
jumble reshuffles everything uh so if

2235
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:49,520
it's if it's not very homogeneous you're

2236
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:53,960
not going to get you know homogeneous

2237
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:57,080
results um for some stuff obviously I

2238
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:59,880
mean [ __ ] those 991 s1s were it was like

2239
01:34:57,079 --> 01:35:03,000
growing just clones of each other the

2240
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:06,279
whole [ __ ] run

2241
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,158
um but you know I don't even if that

2242
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:12,198
were if every clone that you if every

2243
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:17,439
time you made s1's it was you know

2244
01:35:12,198 --> 01:35:18,960
perfect in line with how the mom was um

2245
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:21,279
that's not necessarily what I want

2246
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:24,399
because everything has its drawback no

2247
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:26,880
matter how good it is you just you know

2248
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:31,079
there's only so much room in the cup uh

2249
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:34,920
and very few things like very

2250
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:39,039
few just check every box

2251
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:42,158
um what I'd much prefer is is something

2252
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:43,800
that has a representation of the

2253
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:46,920
expression that I

2254
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:51,480
like but with improvements on you know

2255
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:55,118
whatever else is wrong with it um

2256
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:59,599
whatever failing it has you know if I

2257
01:35:55,118 --> 01:36:02,279
I'm I'm much more excited about oh

2258
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,159
that's what I that's what I love about

2259
01:36:02,279 --> 01:36:06,118
that

2260
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:09,799
weed but in a better

2261
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:12,799
form I I can I understand it completely

2262
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:15,079
I you know um I've gone through stages

2263
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:18,719
where I hate keeping cuts of anything

2264
01:36:15,079 --> 01:36:21,118
bro uh I really enjoy like that unknown

2265
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:23,719
of popping seeds dude and you're right

2266
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:26,880
like I'm not

2267
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:29,118
like has there been plans that I want a

2268
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,279
an expression a certain expression that

2269
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:34,000
the mom or whatever you know whatever

2270
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,960
that I want to see of course but like

2271
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,399
sometimes like that's the fun part of

2272
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:40,118
popping some of these crosses that some

2273
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:44,920
of these guys make is like for example

2274
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:47,759
the P Haze for you know scen P Haze is

2275
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:50,480
uh sweet PE times Band-Aid Haze number

2276
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,199
seven I believe and that's yeah one of

2277
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:54,118
our uh local U from our Discord one of

2278
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:57,118
the guys

2279
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:59,479
um selections I guess or cross he made

2280
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:02,039
uh something that uh I enjoyed about

2281
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:04,519
running those was the finding the ones

2282
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:05,519
I'm not a big the hazes that I've tried

2283
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,880
there's certain ones that there's

2284
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,159
certain things about Haze I just don't

2285
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:11,239
like mainly like the flavor the profiles

2286
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:15,399
and stuff like that the highs obviously

2287
01:37:11,238 --> 01:37:18,079
I enjoy um growing

2288
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:19,920
them do I say I don't know if I would if

2289
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:22,880
I had the right setup I would enjoy them

2290
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:26,239
most of my tents are not um set up for

2291
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:28,319
hazes are growing hazes uh the am hazes

2292
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:32,039
that I grew which I didn't

2293
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:33,639
finish uh just because of my that was

2294
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:36,760
some [ __ ] that I through with when dad

2295
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:38,480
was going through all this [ __ ] um those

2296
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:40,239
what blew my [ __ ] mind and you were

2297
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:43,039
talking about

2298
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:45,519
like the way plants are and the way they

2299
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:47,118
express and the negatives and drawbacks

2300
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:50,400
something that blew my mind about those

2301
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:53,000
am hazes was how they didn't like light

2302
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:54,079
they literally the one and a couple of

2303
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,599
the other

2304
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:57,760
noticed this too I'm not going to take

2305
01:37:55,599 --> 01:37:59,279
credit for the one knowing that I just

2306
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,760
they told me like yo they don't like

2307
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:03,559
light like that and I was like I want to

2308
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:07,320
try [ __ ] and test stuff you know you

2309
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:09,039
know I I like to think that you know I

2310
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:10,599
want to try [ __ ] and see it for myself

2311
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:12,158
it's not that I don't believe people but

2312
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:14,520
sure enough put them direct the ones

2313
01:38:12,158 --> 01:38:16,519
directly under the center of the light

2314
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,000
uh started to kind of just not really

2315
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:20,880
like look terrible but just little

2316
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,920
yellowed up and kind of just you know

2317
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:26,359
did some droopy [ __ ] and the ones on the

2318
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,719
sides were perfect and I moved I

2319
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,198
switched some stuff around and move

2320
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:31,359
those to all the edges of the tent and

2321
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:33,559
sure enough they perked up so something

2322
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:35,158
about like that blew my mind that it was

2323
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,199
like okay now not only do I have to like

2324
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:39,559
flower this longer flowering variety

2325
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:42,039
plant out in a tent that sucks now I

2326
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:43,960
have to like worry about the how much

2327
01:38:42,039 --> 01:38:45,599
the light it gets and [ __ ] and for me

2328
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,359
I'm popping different [ __ ] and different

2329
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:50,279
tins you know I'm never really running

2330
01:38:48,359 --> 01:38:52,279
uh I mean I'm running full packs a lot

2331
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:54,519
of times but sometimes like for example

2332
01:38:52,279 --> 01:38:56,399
I might have two of each like right now

2333
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:58,400
I got a full pack of skank dogs which is

2334
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,000
six seeds going but I have them at

2335
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:03,479
different stages based on how fast one

2336
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,599
grew or how slow one grows so I try to

2337
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:09,879
keep plants together and and I do train

2338
01:39:06,599 --> 01:39:11,719
to a certain point but you know as I've

2339
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:13,560
gotten more involved in more plants it's

2340
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:14,679
harder to do all that [ __ ] or it's I

2341
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,000
don't have all the time in the world to

2342
01:39:14,679 --> 01:39:20,560
do that I have a real life so um I try

2343
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:24,279
to just do it based on um yeah how tall

2344
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,679
they grow and [ __ ] like that so um

2345
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:28,319
what were we getting at with this oh

2346
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:29,960
drawbacks so yeah just seeing that uh

2347
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:32,118
kind of blew my [ __ ] mind because it

2348
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:33,039
was like yeah it's negatives that I

2349
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:35,439
never would have thought I would have

2350
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:38,719
thought this [ __ ] sativa would have

2351
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:40,719
loved Son you know uh I don't know where

2352
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:42,880
all the shit's from and don't pretend to

2353
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:46,118
but in my mind I'm thinking this plant's

2354
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:49,719
GNA love like light oh [ __ ] no dude it

2355
01:39:46,118 --> 01:39:51,679
hated it so it's kind of funny like that

2356
01:39:49,719 --> 01:39:54,039
sometimes it's weird yeah I just had to

2357
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:58,079
turn down the light on on

2358
01:39:54,039 --> 01:40:01,079
the PES packs that I have going because

2359
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:03,000
they same thing they started

2360
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:06,079
like they started getting pretty

2361
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,520
stressed out from just and it wasn't

2362
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,279
it's I didn't even like Crank It Up

2363
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:13,360
higher or anything you know it was just

2364
01:40:10,279 --> 01:40:15,960
what I normally would put it at for you

2365
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:17,839
know their distance from The Lion I saw

2366
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,198
that too on my my batch and I feel like

2367
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,079
a terrible grower because I've seen

2368
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:23,799
other guys grows of PHS and I'm just

2369
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,279
well I had thrips and like I said I

2370
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,800
always had a lot of [ __ ] going on and um

2371
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:30,479
I actually when those were transplanted

2372
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,719
uh she transplanted them for me while I

2373
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:35,559
was out of town and like I'm not saying

2374
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:37,599
she [ __ ] them up or anything like that

2375
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,840
I'm just saying it's not the most ideal

2376
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:40,679
situations there's like three or four

2377
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,719
things going on there but yeah I also

2378
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:45,239
saw that too I had to dial a lot of [ __ ]

2379
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:49,439
back I also made the mistake of running

2380
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:52,158
them um she put them in two two gallon

2381
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:54,559
pots instead of like three or or five

2382
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,559
gallon and uh that kind of [ __ ] me a

2383
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:59,719
little bit because at the time uh wasn't

2384
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,280
really leaning into a lot of U like I

2385
01:40:59,719 --> 01:41:02,960
wasn't really feeding a whole lot I was

2386
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,519
really kind of relying on like what was

2387
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,800
in you know the the soil and stuff at

2388
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,719
the time um these runs I'm doing the

2389
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:12,520
canera dude and I'm [ __ ] loving it

2390
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:15,239
bro I wish I could show you some of this

2391
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:17,000
[ __ ] bro I'm so happy with everything I

2392
01:41:15,238 --> 01:41:19,519
I've just surrendered to it and I'm

2393
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,760
doing exactly what they call for like on

2394
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,920
their everything to it not not

2395
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,480
everything in their line but I'm

2396
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:28,079
literally just doing the the the the

2397
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:30,238
tana floras and the Tana or the Vegas

2398
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:31,800
and floras or whatever it's called and

2399
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:36,118
then I'm doing some cow mag some

2400
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:38,599
recharge and um uh there was something

2401
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:40,238
else some mosquito dunks and something

2402
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:42,400
else I forgot what no I think that's it

2403
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,238
actually but uh yeah dude and I'm and

2404
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:46,319
I'm loving it dude I'm running in Ocean

2405
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:49,198
though still so for like the first few

2406
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:51,039
weeks I'm I'm you know when I upot I'm

2407
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:54,198
not really like pumping them that hard

2408
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:57,000
and and right now I'm kind of I'm right

2409
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:58,559
like five 600 ppms whatever maybe some a

2410
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,760
little bit more like I said I got a

2411
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,159
couple different stages so like my

2412
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,880
seedlings and things like that I'm like

2413
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:06,279
two two 300 somewhere in that area maybe

2414
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:10,719
a little bit more by the time I had some

2415
01:42:06,279 --> 01:42:12,439
C mag in there but um yeah man it's it's

2416
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,359
great dude it's more expensive and I

2417
01:42:12,439 --> 01:42:16,839
know you could get stuff for a better

2418
01:42:14,359 --> 01:42:18,439
price and I'm going to experiment uh

2419
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,760
with it this is was this happened to be

2420
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:22,279
the time I was going to experiment with

2421
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,199
the can of some of the Cana products and

2422
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:26,639
dude I [ __ ] love them bro like

2423
01:42:24,198 --> 01:42:28,879
they're I've messed with biob bids a

2424
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:32,440
little bit I [ __ ] like that bro that

2425
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:33,679
[ __ ] was it burned a lot of my plants

2426
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:35,439
you know a lot of those [ __ ] they call

2427
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:39,440
for the certain amount and it's always

2428
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:41,238
way over bro it [ __ ] my [ __ ] up so um

2429
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:42,399
that's I think that's why I had a little

2430
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:44,919
bit of trouble with Kenna in the

2431
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:47,238
beginning because I was I'm used to [ __ ]

2432
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:49,760
Burning uh so I really didn't

2433
01:42:47,238 --> 01:42:51,919
surrendered to or didn't really like do

2434
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,719
what they recommended I was you know

2435
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:57,639
that Golden Rule going half or half yeah

2436
01:42:55,719 --> 01:42:59,920
and didn't really wasn't really excited

2437
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:01,920
about what I was seeing and I was having

2438
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,800
some issues with one of the blue sours

2439
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:07,079
it just like I could tell it was hungry

2440
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:08,520
and I like I was like dude I looked it

2441
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:10,599
up on their little chart and they were

2442
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:13,119
like you know add whatever it was at the

2443
01:43:10,599 --> 01:43:15,599
time like 50 milliliters of the the

2444
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:19,359
Vegas or whatever the the the grow the

2445
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:21,319
grow part of it the and uh so I did bro

2446
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:24,079
and literally like within like six hours

2447
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:25,920
that [ __ ] was like Greening back

2448
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:29,000
up and like perked up and I was like

2449
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:31,520
[ __ ] so for like a week straight I just

2450
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,399
followed their regimen bro and like it

2451
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,880
feels kind of I feel like a goober kind

2452
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:37,960
of because like normally like the way I

2453
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:40,560
would do it in the past would just kind

2454
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:42,880
of just operate not completely off

2455
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:44,520
visuals but you know you grow for a

2456
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,639
while and use the same pot size you kind

2457
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:49,320
of have an understanding of when your

2458
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:51,118
plants are uh needing food at least the

2459
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:54,559
way I was growing and I would kind of

2460
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:58,279
operate in that uh way of growing and

2461
01:43:54,560 --> 01:44:00,039
then like I would maybe uh top dress or

2462
01:43:58,279 --> 01:44:03,479
I would lean in on bottles especially

2463
01:44:00,039 --> 01:44:05,719
during flour but like doing it this way

2464
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:07,158
uh that's been interesting because I've

2465
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:09,880
tested it out

2466
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:13,279
like freshly transplanet [ __ ] for

2467
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:16,679
example literally um I

2468
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:17,960
forget the bars uh Bittersweet

2469
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:19,520
recommended the bar lights they're

2470
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,760
little clone lights little bars

2471
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,760
four-footers I forget the brand I guess

2472
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,639
it doesn't really matter but I got them

2473
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:29,079
under that

2474
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:32,079
and bro I gave him 200 uh 200 ppms of uh

2475
01:44:29,079 --> 01:44:33,639
the can of stuff and some cow mag and

2476
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:35,158
they're like a week and a half old and

2477
01:44:33,639 --> 01:44:37,679
they haven't burned they love it bro

2478
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:40,479
they're perked up like I'm also running

2479
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:43,440
the these ones in promix I don't have I

2480
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:45,559
don't really use a lot of promix uh so

2481
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:47,198
I've up here in Michigan bro I've just

2482
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:50,599
like had a lot of issues with starting

2483
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:53,198
seeds and just weird little things and I

2484
01:44:50,599 --> 01:44:55,560
thought a lot of it was my water um I've

2485
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:58,039
dialed that in I got really a decent

2486
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:59,719
little setup with r and a couple things

2487
01:44:58,039 --> 01:45:01,880
uh actually need to do some work on it

2488
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:04,279
today but um I didn't couldn't figure

2489
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:07,920
out what it was back at home the water

2490
01:45:04,279 --> 01:45:12,559
the city water U had a lot of calcium in

2491
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:14,199
it and other stuff I guess uh you I knew

2492
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,760
it had a lot of calcium in it because on

2493
01:45:14,198 --> 01:45:17,198
my fish tanks you get a lot of calcium

2494
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:21,320
buildup and stuff like on the filters

2495
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:23,678
and [ __ ] like that and um that water was

2496
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:25,719
great here this water I'm ating off of

2497
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:28,599
[ __ ] whale water and it's dog [ __ ]

2498
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:31,399
bro it comes out like 300 ppms that's

2499
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:33,599
the [ __ ] tap bro that's fil like not

2500
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:35,638
uh red but it's semi filtered or some

2501
01:45:33,599 --> 01:45:37,360
[ __ ] Bro there is a a pre-filter down

2502
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:40,840
there on that system on that whale

2503
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:45,079
system and it's dog [ __ ] uh so I do have

2504
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:49,440
to run R so I did switch to the pr miix

2505
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:52,679
with the micara bro and I I don't know

2506
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:53,598
if I'm sound like Rob or not Rob but uh

2507
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:55,920
anyway

2508
01:45:53,599 --> 01:45:58,679
I'm sound like somebody else anyways uh

2509
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,039
it actually really my seeds these these

2510
01:45:58,679 --> 01:46:01,239
Sprout are great dude I'm really

2511
01:46:00,039 --> 01:46:02,800
impressed with I don't know if it's a

2512
01:46:01,238 --> 01:46:05,959
coincidence you know you gotta take that

2513
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,560
[ __ ] with like grain of salt but uh I'm

2514
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:10,239
gonna start maybe trying to start all my

2515
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:12,800
[ __ ] in promix because I mean you know

2516
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,879
you got like eight to 10 days there uh I

2517
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,480
went ahead and started at like I guess

2518
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,800
it's probably been like seven to give

2519
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:22,559
them food and they it's it's been really

2520
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,440
smooth normally I run in the uh uh Happy

2521
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,039
Frog

2522
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:29,559
or like a mix of Happy Frog and cocoa or

2523
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:32,840
a mix of Coco and fox farm and sometimes

2524
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,880
Fox Farm can be a little too much and uh

2525
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:35,360
yeah just really impressed with the

2526
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,719
promix dude I don't know do you run any

2527
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:38,799
promx have you [ __ ] with promx at all

2528
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:43,719
I know you do a lot of organic [ __ ] but

2529
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:47,119

that's that'll get me you know pretty

2539
01:47:16,359 --> 01:47:24,000
far usually um if I need to feed I give

2540
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:25,960
a bit of uh fish hydraulis from

2541
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,679
dram

2542
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:33,118
um I mean that's pretty much that's most

2543
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:34,520
of my feed really is uh just some dram

2544
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:39,118
fish iyra

2545
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:43,960
aate um yeah it's been you know I end up

2546
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:46,960
I still give uh microbes and fulvic acid

2547
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:53,158
little pinch of uh saponins in there

2548
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:54,840
just to like help um the uh the Water um

2549
01:47:53,158 --> 01:47:59,118
because I've been I've been like messing

2550
01:47:54,840 --> 01:48:03,279
around with dry backs a little bit

2551
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:05,839
um for the last several uh last several

2552
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:07,719
flowering runs

2553
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:13,560
and

2554
01:48:07,719 --> 01:48:16,719
uh it just helps to like soak it up

2555
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:21,199
um yeah I end up switching

2556
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:25,359
to uh what's it called a like a I guess

2557
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:29,000
it's a pure eps salt stuff from uh from

2558
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:32,799
envy and some gypsum some Diamond

2559
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,520
K uh that's like what I taper taper down

2560
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:38,079
to whenever I'm not when I'm trying to

2561
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:40,159
give cow mag but not give anything else

2562
01:48:38,079 --> 01:48:43,399
attached to it

2563
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:46,118
besides uh you know

2564
01:48:43,399 --> 01:48:47,920
sulfur the organic shit's over my head

2565
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:50,880
bro I'll be honest like a lot of that

2566
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:53,679
[ __ ] uh I admire you guys for doing it

2567
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,880
dude and it's awesome I I think that's

2568
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:58,279
something that is so cool about weed in

2569
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:59,800
general how many styles there are and

2570
01:48:58,279 --> 01:49:01,960
how many ways there are I know we all

2571
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:04,520
joke on each other bottle boys and [ __ ]

2572
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:06,198
but I think it is really cool how

2573
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,520
especially like with like the Discord

2574
01:49:06,198 --> 01:49:10,118
scene everybody's way they grow and [ __ ]

2575
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:12,560
and we give each I know we joke on each

2576
01:49:10,118 --> 01:49:14,679
other but I really do enjoy seeing

2577
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,480
people's way of doing [ __ ] because it's

2578
01:49:14,679 --> 01:49:22,719
you can learn a thing or two from people

2579
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:23,799
you know oh dude I I got so I was

2580
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:28,760
growing

2581
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:31,960
successfully in Organics right but when

2582
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:34,679
I started talking more and more to you

2583
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:36,560
know people like bidder and local and n

2584
01:49:34,679 --> 01:49:38,639
and you know people who are running

2585
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:42,080
[ __ ]

2586
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:44,239
uh doing like hydroponic or drain to

2587
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:48,000
waste whatever um

2588
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:52,079
salt um like trying to pick

2589
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,319
up what they're doing and incorporate it

2590
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:55,920
into

2591
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:59,279
into my program you

2592
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,880
know uh and that's been like that's why

2593
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:04,679
I've been messing with

2594
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:09,279
dryback um messing with

2595
01:50:04,679 --> 01:50:10,279
uh how I feed um doing it like more

2596
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:13,238
based

2597
01:50:10,279 --> 01:50:14,840
on on when they're pushing

2598
01:50:13,238 --> 01:50:17,279
stuff

2599
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:19,560
um to try and kind

2600
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:21,118
of you know because I mean it's still

2601
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:24,480
it's still the same

2602
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:28,639
plant um in our systems there there may

2603
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:32,598
be differences in how we deliver those

2604
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:35,239
nutrients or how we how we do things but

2605
01:50:32,599 --> 01:50:36,880
those plants still do better when you

2606
01:50:35,238 --> 01:50:38,839
know they're they're finished without

2607
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:41,199
nitrogen you know but they're going to

2608
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:45,319
need calcium still so finding a calcium

2609
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:48,839
and you know just [ __ ] like that um and

2610
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:51,799
being able to like uh break down other

2611
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:54,480
processes better because you know

2612
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:56,679
Hydroponics is is such a you know they

2613
01:50:54,479 --> 01:50:59,399
fine-tuned it to such a

2614
01:50:56,679 --> 01:51:02,599
degree where

2615
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:06,679
um I guess it's a it's a lot more like

2616
01:51:02,599 --> 01:51:09,400
scientific in in what's actually going

2617
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:11,679
on uh because they're controlling you

2618
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:15,679
know much more of

2619
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:18,239
that um and just just incorporating

2620
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:22,039
those you know those hey we found out

2621
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:24,399
this that's why we do it this way now um

2622
01:51:22,039 --> 01:51:26,880
and and figuring out how to you know

2623
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:28,319
kind of incorporate it into into how I

2624
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,239
grow cuz I

2625
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:34,559
still

2626
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:37,678
I I have friends who grow both and it

2627
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:41,639
really doesn't matter I don't think um

2628
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:44,639
it's more so on the grower and and how

2629
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:48,520
well you can actually grow you know and

2630
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:49,800
how how many uh problems pop up in that

2631
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:53,840
in that

2632
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:57,039
grow yeah I think uh I think I'm that's

2633
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:59,279
a good place to end it for this one bro

2634
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:01,078
um I think what I got on this free uh

2635
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:03,840
version only like two hours so I think

2636
01:52:01,078 --> 01:52:06,479
we're about to hit our our two hour

2637
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,039

01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:13,118

2640
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,039
growing and stuff maybe go into Organics

2641
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:17,359

2642
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:19,719
