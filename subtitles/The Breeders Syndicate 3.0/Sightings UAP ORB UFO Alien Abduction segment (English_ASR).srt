1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,660
regression therapy is an extremely

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,539
controversial method in which abductees

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,879
relive their UFO encounters under

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,798
hypnosis some scientists suggest that

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,360
what they're actually reliving might be

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,939
repressed emotional trauma or

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,759
subconscious fears from childhood but

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,359
for the abductee the Alien Encounter is

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,359
very real

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,039
in abduction cases

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,259
many times

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,780
the person will remember consciously

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,579
that something strange or bizarre

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,079
happened to them something out of the

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,820
ordinary

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,600
they

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,640
desire to go into hypnosis

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,460
to retrieve

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,039
the hidden memories during some

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,378
abductions I'm aware of them

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,379
of their taking sperm samples

22
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,659
in many different ways they've done it

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,659
many different ways

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,140
with tubes with

25
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,219
um

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,219
like catheters

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,959
there's one way I have not been able to

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,759
deal with

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,759
emotionally or under regression

30
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,478
and that's one where there's a being on

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,700
top of me

32
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,280
and I can't deal with that yet

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,500
under hypnosis Jesse long is reliving

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,519
trauma that he believes is caused by his

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,519
abduction experience

36
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,280
[Music]

37
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:44,340
[Applause]

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,799
as incredible as it sounds these people

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,680
are actually reliving these terrifying

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,860
experiences long claims to have not only

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,880
emotional scars but real physical scars

42
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,219
as well

43
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,959
even more disturbing are stories from

44
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,899
women who believed they were abducted

45
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,319
for breeding purposes as incredible as

46
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,320
this may sound

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,679
urge

48
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:13,080
cases having to do with missing fetuses

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,199
I remember they numbed me from the waist

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,879
down and they took something that looked

51
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,359
like

52
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:20,359
uh

53
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,259
and

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,200
umbilical cord attached to placenta

55
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:31,199
and they levitated it into some kind of

56
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:36,539
chamber later abduction

57
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:38,759
scenarios she is actually shown a baby

58
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,799
now this baby is not like a human baby

59
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,560
that as we know it

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,560
it's a cross between

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,140
an alien and a human it's the central

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,019
question of UFO research today why are

63
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:54,659
they manufacturing these Offspring these

64
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,159
babies if we knew the answer to that I

65
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,859
think we would have a large part of the

66
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,439
UFO mystery finally in hand

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,500
not every reported encounter with an

68
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,000
alien is frightening and traumatic some

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,739
people who claim contact with

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,900
extraterrestrials tell us that for them

71
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,900
the encounter was a peaceful community
