it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,920

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,640
BC Seed makers there is uh one of the

24
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,079
most successful BC Seed makers there is

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,239
that still around doing his thing um

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,480

00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,719
off yeah Jay so like I mentioned before

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,960
I was actually just refreshing myself

31
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,239
and watched the last couple of chats you

32
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,000
had with Matt um which was now maybe

33
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,239
just under a year

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,959
ago in there yeah in there you talked

35
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:24,438
about you know moving uh to Argentina

36
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,919
and so maybe before we get into the the

37
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,078
nitty-gritty of what's been going on

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,478
just recently maybe tell us a bit about

39
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,438
what it was actually like to move like

40
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,840
what was that whole experience like um

41
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,758
well for me I'm I'm quite used to moving

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,640
in my life so I lived in Spain for quite

43
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,399
a few years and in Hall and and back and

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,718
forth to Canada so I'm I'm quite used to

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,599
moving but uh this is a long way to

46
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,158
travel it's about 30 hour flight from

47
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,239
from Canada and I've been going back and

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,960
forth now for the last year uh about

49
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,199
four or five trips and now I'm making a

50
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,399
more permanent switch um down here um

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,039
just the cost of living is so much

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,560
cheaper and uh to get into the legal

53
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,599
system for for growing and selling seeds

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,520
it's way cheaper and more econ

55
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,799
economical here Canada is just uh it's a

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,280
nightmare of bureaucracy so it just

57
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,519
seemed like a natural uh move to me I

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,959
speak Spanish or a basic Spanish um so

59
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,360
yeah yeah this was just a nice place

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,080
where I can come and produce seeds here

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,319
on a larger scale at a much much better

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,560
price is Argentina mostly a

63
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,560
Spanish-speaking

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,759
Nation yes it's all Spanish okay yeah I

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,360
didn't know if it was like Portuguese

66
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,679
like Brazil because it's down isn't it

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,519
down in that region yeah yeah well

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,319
neighbors to Brazil that's right okay

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,280
cool yeah but they have their own

70
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,958
version of Spanish here it's not it's

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,280
not like Mexican yeah that makes sense

72
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,439
yeah cultural cultural

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,598
Spanish was there a lot of preparation

74
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:57,120
for you to move like from there not

75
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,518
really um like I said the last over the

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,759
last year and a half or so I've been

77
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,120
making regular trips down here just

78
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,719
getting to know the market going to the

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,120
big Expos and the trade shows getting to

80
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:11,598
know the Distributors and the licensing

81
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,680
process um and yeah so my my choice was

82
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,318
between Chile and Argentina but in the

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,400
end I chose Argentina it's just there's

84
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,518
more going on here um I just I I like

85
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,439
the like the culture and the city is

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,599
like buenos Aras is like living in a

87
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,878
European city like Barcelona or and then

88
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,119
when you go out to the country it's like

89
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,919
being in the Prairies out in Canada go

90
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,840
out to rural Alberta or something you

91
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,759
know oh wow so it's got kind of The Best

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,319
of Both Worlds um yeah so yeah that

93
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,919
sounds lovely um one thing I I want to

94
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,438
ask you right away is uh what the actual

95
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,199
kind of uh weed scene there was like you

96
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,519
know genetics culture all that there

97
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,719
there's a huge weed scene here and it's

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,920
been U it's it's growing by bounds every

99
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,878
year um and they they've recently

100
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,839
legalized it um but but the legal Iz

101
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,759
ation process is so broad um there's the

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,719
medical personal licenses that you can

103
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:10,399
open a what they call an OMG Club where

104
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,079
you can uh grow weed for people you

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
can't make a profit but you can pay your

106
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,720
Growers very well yeah um that's kind of

107
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,639
how that works um my the licensing that

108
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,320
I've began here now is for seed

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,519
production um seed import export and

110
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,000
research um so that's yeah that's the

111
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,758
process I'm I'm starting now and is is

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,399
it is it less prohibitively expensive

113
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,720
down there to get those licenses than

114
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,918
say Canada or us it's it's

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,120
ridiculously economic I don't want to

116
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,478
almost say it because I don't want my

117
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,360
competition to move here it's it's

118
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,279
hundreds of dollars not tens of

119
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,919
thousands of dollars put it that way

120
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,119
under a thousand dollars I got all my

121
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,000
licenses yeah that's amazing that's

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,840
amazing so it's it's just a paperwork

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,279
process so is it a long paperwork

124
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:05,319
process um um not too bad uh a few

125
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:07,359
months a few months um and I'm going to

126
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm doing my prayor process in the in

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
the one of the provinces a smaller City

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,478
so it'll happen a lot faster than doing

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,918
it here in buers areas where there's 17

130
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,719
18 million people oh sure it takes

131
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,959
longer to get to the paperwork so um I

132
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,039
got had my legal problems out in the

133
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,599
province this year so that's where I'm

134
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,240
doing my paperwork now and uh yeah it

135
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
should happen pretty quickly so I'm

136
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,199
pretty pleased with that I've got a good

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,560
lawyer getting my my all my my papers in

138
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,199
order

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,600
so yeah it's been an

140
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,680
adventure um has it changed the work

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,000
that you've been doing to ex uh sorry

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
that's a weird way of saying it has

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
moving there changeed like the way

144
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,638
you've approached your work in any way

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,079
like what have you been working on this

146
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,560
last year or so um well there's lots of

147
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,879
people here and and farms uh that I've

148
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,759
been testing out my genetics so I've got

149
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,038
to see my genetics grow on a much larger

150
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,240
scale and see how they perform here more

151
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,240
so than I could in Canada Canada was so

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,160
prohibitive uh and lot most was indoors

153
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,478
and here I was able to do some see a lot

154
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,800
of my genetics in under green houses and

155
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,758
on big farms and it's and in Chile as

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
well I got friends over there that um

157
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,000
grow for medical associations and just

158
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,719
the scale that I've seen my genetics

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,399
growing on here is just so much better

160
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
than Canada um for for me so yeah I'm

161
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,918
got get getting to learn a lot about my

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,120
strains in a different you know a

163
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,799
different attitude a different climate

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,639
see which ones are thriving which ones

165
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,720
don't do so well can you tell us some

166
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,800
specifics about like specific uh

167
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,680
highlights or contrasts in in in the

168
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,120
growing

169
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,160
patterns uh well the big thing down here

170
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,560
because we're S at the Amazon the high

171
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,039
high humidity uh really really big

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,519
problem here and that's what everybody's

173
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:53,759
looking for all the serious grillers

174
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,318
here they're looking for genetics that

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,919
can handle the humidity and don't get

176
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
Bud Rod or powdery milde um and they

177
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,159
have a lot of lot of the Spanish

178
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,079
genetics is what's on the market here

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,639
the Spanish seed companies and they tend

180
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,680
to have a big problem with uh with with

181
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,360
uh with mold and everybody everybody

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,639
that's been growing my strains here

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,439
that's one of the things that they

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,800
really really like I've did because I

185
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,240
living in British Columbia on the west

186
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,439
coast I'm sure you know all the rain

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
I've a lot of my strains are really

188
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,598
really resistant uh to Bud rot and uh so

189
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,439
I'm I'm hearing a lot of good feedback

190
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,199
um yeah I'm very happy about that and

191
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,560
but yes harvest season now is going to

192
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,680
be um uh in about two and a half months

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,598
or so about two months uh but I've had

194
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
reports from last year as well now I've

195
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,959
been coming here for a while so and are

196
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,478
there any on specific that you're you're

197
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,239
pretty stoked about that have done well

198
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,360
in that super wet climate down there

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,280
actually yeah there's been a few my

200
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,960
Avalon I'm completely happy with it my

201
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,439
blue Dynamite which is the Avalon

202
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,198
original grapefruit cross uh extremely

203
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,000
well but those were I selectively read

204
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,680
those in Canada for mold resistance but

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,639
U my surprises though I've been uh my my

206
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,879
half CBD half THC strain uh first

207
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:15,280
Contact yeah it is just so amazingly

208
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,199
healthy and robust here with no bud Rock

209
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,279
and just it looks the buds look like

210
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
they're they were growing indoors uh oh

211
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,679
wow it was just beautiful this is the

212
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,120
Outdoor feels that I seen of it on two

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,560
different farms and uh how did they take

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,478
that THC CBD down there is is is that

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,240
something that they look for when buying

216
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,679
cannabis um more and more the older

217
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,918
people yeah it's more and more becoming

218
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,478
but they're like they just want the

219
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,918
strong stuff to a lot of the people

220
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,519
because because people here the econom

221
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,519
is bad people want the most bang for the

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,159
buck makes sense

223
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,799
so yeah but my other strain that's been

224
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,240
thriving down here is my Latina sativa

225
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,039
if I told you about that one it's the

226
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,360
Colombian red acrossed with a Mexican

227
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,679
sativa that I've been working on back in

228
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,680
Canada for years years and years and

229
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,399
there's plants now over it's still early

230
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,519
in the season but three three and a half

231
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,679
meters and going strong and start just

232
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,320
starting to flower now where did you

233
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,799
grab that Colombian red from do you

234
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,160
remember where it was

235
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,278
sourced I'm not exactly sure it was

236
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,759
probably at least 20 years ago I think

237
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,480
it was one of Ramy L Joe's friends oh

238
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:26,039
wow yeah so yeah it was it was yeah back

239
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,440
in the early 2000s so I kind actually

240
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,039
actually can't nail it down right now

241
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,959
off top of my head was it long flower

242
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:35,879
yes very long um about about 12 weeker

243
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,278
about 12 weeks we were this close to

244
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,360
getting ramulo and this close to getting

245
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,600
him on the show oh you were gonna oh

246
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,519
sweet oh yeah I have talked to him and

247
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,440
he's super cool he's super nice but yeah

248
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,879
nice guy yeah he's great and and what

249
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,760
was the Mexican sativa like that you

250
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:57,320
used in that line um I think it was a

251
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,919
wwan oh nice um that I used to yeah and

252
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,720
yeah still like I said it's from from 20

253
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,559
years years ago so I kind of revived a

254
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,560
few years ago I revived it again and

255
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,518
then brought the seeds down here and uh

256
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,119
they're just yeah they're just thriving

257
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,759
thriving they plant doesn't stop growing

258
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,679
like they're back at home huh yeah yeah

259
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,240
exactly makes

260
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,278
sense um I did want to ask real quick as

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,000
well like have you been working on

262
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,000
anything new since you've been there um

263
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,600
yeah I have a a few local strains uh two

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,200
local ones I think one is from Brazil

265
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,800
another one from the northern provinces

266
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,920
here The Growers up in

267
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:39,120
centes Northern province of Argentina

268
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,719
have been growing and amazing like the

269
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,360
the branching pattern it reminds me of

270
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,000
the old original grapefruit from back in

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,360
the 90s and just constantly branches but

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,799
has that almost like the a haze smell oh

273
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,240
nice a lot of people tell are telling me

274
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,838
when they see the cut here I think it's

275
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,799
reminisced a lot of the old Brazilian uh

276
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,160
varieties from way back um but this

277
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,919
group group of Growers have had it now

278
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,399
in in the northern provinces here for a

279
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,000
while so we I've got that but yeah

280
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,958
that's a local variety I I believe comes

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,879
from Brazilian genetics because a lot of

282
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,518
the stuff comes down from from Paraguay

283
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,679
and Brazil yeah um Argentinas for some

284
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,399
reason don't grow a lot of their own

285
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,958
weed even though they have such perfect

286
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,278
growing conditions it's it's it's kind

287
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,078
of surprising to me um were there any

288
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:27,320
like old Argentina strains you had heard

289
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,879
of when you got there that were kind of

290
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,120
legendary Legacy type strains

291
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,000
um yeah there's a few things I can't say

292
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,959
any names in specific but no nobody

293
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,679
really raved about any of the the local

294
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:42,679
genetics there wasn't anything that

295
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,439
really stood out as something special uh

296
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,799
when I talk to people I always all the

297
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,480
local Growers you said all all the good

298
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,479
stuff genetics come from elsewhere the

299
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,200
local stuff is it's not worth bragging

300
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,720
about yeah

301
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,519
so so but yeah there Brazilian stuff has

302
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,360
they have some good genetics there so oh

303
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,399
yeah like the bajah blackhead was a big

304
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,560
one there the lon Verde stuff like that

305
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,078
okay

306
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,719
yeah have they taken to the cookie stuff

307
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,919
there like the modern stuff are they are

308
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,278
they about that yet no really they're

309
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,919
not no not yet a few of the a few of the

310
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,720
international like the Dutch and Spanish

311
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,879
companies that try to advertise some of

312
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,920
their seeds as American genetics sure um

313
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,919
because it's the flavor of the the month

314
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,240
type of thing but the cookies and that

315
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,120
not you know I sell quite a bit of the

316
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,839
uh there's a lot of interest in the like

317
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,078
the gelato yeah and the granddaddy pers

318
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,000
and and things like that

319
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:41,078
um but no the cookies hasn't been a big

320
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,399
thing here yet I did that's awesome did

321
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:44,439
smoke some good really good white

322
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,639
truffles the other day though so oh did

323
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,680
you it made it down there yeah that

324
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,000
counts that counts I think count yeah

325
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,198
definitely count as well maybe in bread

326
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,278
cookies for

327
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,719
sure okay that's interesting I mean when

328
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,838
you you know you talked about some of

329
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,959
the the genetics you're getting from

330
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,560
Brazil what's it like being down there

331
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,638
in terms of being exposed to this kind

332
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:12,799
of more Regional

333
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:16,159
genetics um it's well this I'm I'm I

334
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,919
live in Buenos Ares um and uh work

335
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,838
around here so they're exposed to a lot

336
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,000
of international genetics but it's

337
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,440
almost all

338
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,039
Spanish um often Spanish and a few of

339
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,800
the Dutch companies and there's only one

340
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,559
really American country company that

341
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,159
I've seen here on at the trade show

342
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,319
circuit and in the stores is the humbal

343
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:35,879
seed company yeah they've made it big

344
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,680
everywhere yeah so so me the Next

345
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,120
Generation and humbold are basically the

346
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,799
only North American companies that you

347
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,839
see on the making the their rounds down

348
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,559
here yeah well that's nice I mean that

349
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,959
it's not a ton of you know American

350
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,719
competition as it were you know yeah

351
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,119
well the thing is one good thing too I

352
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,440
think we in a good position is uh

353
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,759
they're getting sick of the Spanish

354
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,360
genetics and they're starting to figure

355
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,120
out it's all the same seeds being

356
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,879
repackaged uh all the same name all

357
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,720
slightly similar names but it's all

358
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,078
coming from the same bag yeah and

359
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,759
they've figured that out now and they

360
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,439
want something fresh you know it's

361
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,079
[ __ ] up is in America they still

362
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,160
haven't figured that [ __ ] out it doesn't

363
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,399
matter what

364
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,360
company I can't believe it I can't

365
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:21,559
believe how it's all just white label

366
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,839
repackaged and that's everybody goes um

367
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,039
but what am I gonna do yeah I know yeah

368
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,440
we've talked about it on the show a

369
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,679
bunch and people are just it just like

370
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,040
goes over their head that no there

371
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,399
really are pick from one bin throwing it

372
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:33,958
in a bunch of different seed packages

373
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,720
for the most famous you know why do you

374
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,758
know why man the psychology is like yeah

375
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,320
yeah I know other people do that but I

376
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,600
my the stuff that I buy isn't like that

377
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,879
right yeah that's true yeah well you're

378
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,800
buying a 10 15 cents a seed and then

379
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,360
they turn around put it in a baggie and

380
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,639
and sell it for several dollars yeah the

381
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,360
myar the myar

382
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,600
switch

383
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,399
Yeah so do you want to start digging

384
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,159
into more recent stuff before we jump

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,679
into to anything else oh yeah well yeah

386
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,120
I had a little Adventure yeah I'd love

387
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,479
to hear some more about it it sounded

388
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,198
pretty insane yeah it was pretty insane

389
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,959
it was just just just bad luck um I've

390
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,679
been up here I went to see I in in the

391
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:19,078
in the province here the city of Rosario

392
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,719
uh is I have my friend who has an OM and

393
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,439
and a medical cannabis club and he owns

394
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,360
a cannabis uh radio station for all the

395
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,959
and so I was going to go see him and

396
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,440
have him help me with my paperwork uh to

397
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,198
get registered here in the system so we

398
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,680
were driving there a few weeks ago and

399
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:39,078
we got pulled into a check stop and

400
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,599
happened to be a military check stop in

401
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:46,039
uh what happened to be uh cartel

402
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,480
City and so we they pulled us in they

403
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,879
didn't know what to do with us because

404
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,920
we were

405
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,000
foreigners uh all they and they found

406
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,439
all my my seed collection that I was

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,679
about to declare to the government to

408
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
sign up my my for my licensing sure and

409
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,120
uh they

410
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,519
they were military police they didn't

411
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,799
understand the civilian

412
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:10,600
law and so they locked us up for several

413
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:14,278
days with uh no phone calls no

414
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,199
nothing and uh so yeah just because they

415
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,278
didn't understand the paperwork and I

416
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,159
didn't have the paperwork in correct

417
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,838
order so the only reason we got out is I

418
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,919
have some really good friends and they

419
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,759
called the car rental company and they

420
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:33,559
tracked our car by GP s oh wow and the

421
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,800
GPS showed that we were in a really bad

422
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,278
bad neighborhood where people disappear

423
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,919
yeah so my friends thought we got

424
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,799
carjacked and so they called so they

425
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,078
called they followed the GPS and they

426
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,719
found that we were in the back of a

427
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:49,638
military compound was where they were

428
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,680
keeping us and so he showed up with uh

429
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,159
with his lawyer who happened to be work

430
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,120
for the ministry of security for the

431
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:00,480
province yeah and so my buddy rolled in

432
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
after day three we had no phone calls uh

433
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,640
from anyone or nothing I hav heard but

434
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,038

treated wa let me stop

437
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,959
you what was going through your mind in

438
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,759
the first day or we we had no idea with

439
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,558
no phone calls they they said oh we

440
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,879
called the Canadian embassy but they're

441
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,599
not answering the phone they're

442
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,559
completely useless um jeez so we were

443
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,399
just waiting when we didn't know three

444
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,879

493
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,640
part of my my conditions of my release

494
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,678
is I have to get all my cannabis

495
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,640
licenses fast so I might even get my

496
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,120
licenses faster than the local people

497
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,799
because the judge says I have to wow so

498
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,079
it could end up working out for me uh

499
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,519
I'm trying to think positive about it

500
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,359
but I I can't leave the country until

501
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,319
I'm fully licensed now so so they kept

502
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,839
your passport everything no no they

503
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:50,759
actually they gave me my passport back

504
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:53,839
but with with restrictions yeah yeah so

505
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,359
how has it yeah how how has it all felt

506
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,399
you know how long ago I mean sorry you

507
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,918
may not did tell us this but like about

508
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,720
a week and a half ago I got out so jeez

509
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,960
how were the conditions that oh sorry

510
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,440
yeah how were the conditions did you it

511
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,360
was actually I was very pleased it was a

512
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,200
military prison um and was uh because

513
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,279
they actually have bunks and there's not

514
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,759
eight guys to a cell and so we actually

515
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,480
had uh a mattress and a

516
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,279
blanket um the guys I was in with were

517
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,919
good but there's zero privacy the the

518
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,599
doors are never closed so the police

519
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,400
just come through anytime they want just

520
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,759
go through your things and and they

521
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,640
basically kept us sleep probably for

522
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,000
three days we just every every two hours

523
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,480
they'd come in and wake you up and ask

524
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,480
for an ID number or passport number just

525
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,720
some [ __ ] yeah so we never really

526
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,279
slept for three days uh and the food the

527
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,880
food was shitty like that's what you

528
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,519
expect I guess though yeah jail um but

529
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,039
yeah the guys the guys in there were

530
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,639
funny because we were a novelty they'd

531
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,119
never seen Canadians down there before

532
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,840
and I mean cell beside you know you know

533
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,759
cocaine guys that got seized with a big

534
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,918
airplane from metagene and then our

535
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,759
cellmates a big ecstasy dealer and

536
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,600
everybody was treating us like like

537
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,319
weird like why are you here it's a bag

538
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,439
of seeds we didn't even have a joint

539
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:19,038
with us that's crazy so no flower even

540
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,720
nope not even a single joint oh my so so

541
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,798
the judge and the prosecutor right now

542
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,319
are arguing they're they're trying to

543
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,720
figure out what classification this fits

544
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,599
under because the laws are still being

545
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,600
written here yeah it wasn't really a

546
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,639
crime it was just failure to do do my

547
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,079
paperwork in the right order yeah U so

548
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,278
that's that's what we're working on

549
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,000
right now I'm I'm going to do whatever

550
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:43,359
they they ask of me and I'm going to get

551
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,839
my licenses and just try to get back to

552
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,240
work so yeah that did it affect anything

553
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,798
you currently have growing did you have

554
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,278
to chop stuff

555
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,558
down um um maybe I shouldn't even ask

556
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:58,278
that uh let's go to the next one

557
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:01,319
yeah did it slow you down at all should

558
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:03,919
say um well yeah a little bit Yeah it

559
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,918

561
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,000
punches yeah God that's a rough rough

562
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,840
way to go all for seeds all just trying

563
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,798
to to grow some some legal weed in a in

564
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,038
a country that's supposed to be really

565
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:22,720
uh good with it yeah well it is it is

566
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,960
very good with it it's but my my Spanish

567
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,480
is a little bad and the paperwork I

568
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,558
didn't get it filed in the right order

569
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,679
so that's that's basically we just

570
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,319
basically I'm gonna be looking at a

571
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,759
probably paying a few fines and they'll

572
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,240
be fine well at least it wasn't cartel

573
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,640
people that picked you up yeah but it

574
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
was Narco police it was the the police

575

had a legal problem in my life so yeah

580
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,240
that's got to be very unner especially

581
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,879
in another country where you don't

582
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,919
really speak the language as well and

583
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,840

undiscovered no no I got good friends

609
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,559
friends here I think so yeah dude I

610
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,798
can't even imagine if I were in that

611
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:05,519
same situation like trying to re

612
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:06,798
realistically having to rely on someone

613
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,440
else to figure out one that you're

614
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,720
missing two to take action you know yeah

615
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,400
yeah I was I was trying to figure I

616
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,880
thought when you get it sitting there

617
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,480
you start thinking okay just keep your

618
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,960
mouth shut and let give them time to

619
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,679
figure this out but it was day two two

620
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,960
and a half and like okay did they figure

621
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,679
this out now and then that like a

622
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,960
miracle they showed up out of nowhere

623
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,320
and and so so get so the police they

624
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,519
they treated us like [ __ ] yeah uh and

625
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:35,398
then after we had my friends come and

626
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,798
visit us we started treating getting

627
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,439
treated a lot a lot better and then at

628
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,798
the end when when the judge gave us the

629
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,000
release and we went back to the this the

630
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,639

721

business opportunity but I want to do

722
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,480
things myself and not team up with too

723
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,440
many people yeah um it might take me

724
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,519
slow longer to get into the system but

725
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,440
I'm My Own Boss then and that's that's

726
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,679
how I

727
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,679
prefer I didn't move I didn't move down

728
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,440
here to uh grow for other people but

729
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,840
I've been offered some several big farms

730
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,080
down here that are licensed H but I'm

731
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:57,240
taking my time I'm not in any hurry uh

732
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,119
well now now I'm in a hurry obviously

733
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,120
right

734
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,000
after my legal problems other than that

735
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:06,639
you know I have been kind of easing into

736
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,038
it quite slowly so but I I sponsor I'm

737
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,720
the sponsor of a few of the big cannabis

738
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,879
cups in Cordova and Rosario and North

739
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,960
buenos Ares so I've gotten to know the

740
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,919
community very well the last few years

741
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,278
so are there several cannabis cups a

742
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,919
year there many many it's like the USA

743
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:27,440
depending St yeah yeah no they're

744
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,200
they're popping up there's more every

745
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,480
every year there's more so that's

746
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,399
awesome it's awesome is is are the

747
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,640
Spanish there in heavy presence or are

748
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,558
they mostly doing the

749
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,240
mailing uh they're here in a heavy

750
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,720
prevence but they usually team up with a

751
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,319
local distributor yeah um and they have

752
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,079
to go through the licensing process as

753
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,918
well so a lot of the big farmers here

754
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,519
that with the licenses they get

755
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,759
contracts with the Spanish companies or

756
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,038
the Dutch companies make their seeds

757
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,119
look because they can't import seeds

758
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,319
here they have to be produced here yeah

759
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:03,918
uh so importing is is not not really

760
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:07,200
allowed but obviously everybody does it

761
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,600
um but yeah yeah they're still setting

762
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,558
up the framework of the business here so

763
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,639
more and more the seed that's being sold

764
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:16,119
here is being produced here yeah uh when

765
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,519
it comes to the Spanish companies like

766
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,079
in some of the Dutch companies are they

767
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,120
actually sending their own gear down

768
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,519
there or are they just having them

769
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:27,678
produce seeds and packaging it as their

770
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:29,278
gear um I believe bit of both yeah that

771
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,960
makes sense

772
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:37,359
yeah yeah didn't make enough here to get

773
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:39,159
into the system yeah yeah so sounds like

774
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,879
it's a good place to to produce a lot of

775
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,519
seeds though by you know the

776
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,679
economy-wise how cheap it is to produce

777
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:48,679
seeds down there yeah the economy for me

778
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,080
the economy is is yeah the number one

779
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,080
reason I can be here um you know for

780
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:59,079
couple hundred dollars they can rent a

781
00:30:54,079 --> 00:31:02,240
farm wow so and yeah labor is cheap and

782
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,240
highly skilled yeah the roads are good

783
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,200
better than

784
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,599
Canada oh wow so you know they have

785
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,080
economic problems but everything seems

786
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,638
to work here

787
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:16,158
so you had a good

788
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,240
question uh I I have a couple actually

789
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,120
but uh so while you were talking about

790
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,558
that it just reminded me of what's been

791
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,158
going on in Thailand have you have you

792
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:28,759
heard much of that Jay like the the

793
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,679
recent changes again yeah I haven't too

794
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,839
closely so you know a bunch of people

795
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:36,000
moved there because they were opening up

796
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:37,918
Etc wreck medical everything the newest

797
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,519
government is like doing a full 180 on

798
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,679
wreck um and I wonder what's going to

799
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,120
happen to all our friends or people we

800
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,399
know who have actually moved there to

801
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:52,879
grow um yeah I have a few friends too

802
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,239
yeah newest government's not keen on it

803
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,399
but they're keeping mid as far as I know

804
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,159
oh okay well in Argentina here too just

805
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,398
had pardon me the uh election a few

806
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:07,240
months ago of the the new uh president

807
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:10,079
here and he claims to be a a Libertarian

808
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,599
but I think he's pretty hard on drugs so

809
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,879
some people some people are scared of

810
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,480
what he's goingon to do but I think this

811
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,639
is so ingrained into the system now and

812
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,558
there's corruption on on every level

813
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:23,879
here that on other levels that the level

814
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,918
of corruption here there's no point

815
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,159
there's no way for them to get this out

816
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,559
of the system now like even if even if

817
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,120
the government does want to change it

818
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:35,119
it's cannabis is in now um there's there

819
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,319
is no changing it yeah I can't put the

820
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,319
genie back in the

821
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,319
bottom

822
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:48,119
yeah pardon me you're good you're all

823
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,319
good um I did so the other question I

824
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:52,239
had was uh what's going on back in

825
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,960
Canada like are you needing to maintain

826
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,120
anything over there while you're still

827
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,679
while you were in Argentina I I have um

828
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,798
I have my genetics um safe with uh uh

829
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,840
friends back in Canada and uh just

830
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:09,038
guarding my mother strains things like

831
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:11,558
that um but my partner's still in Canada

832
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:14,398
running a website it's going he's well

833
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:18,079
well stocked uh before I moved down here

834
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:20,518
he made sure he was well stocked um yeah

835
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,439
and so yeah other than that things are

836
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,278
going on smoothly in Canada I just we

837
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,960
just couldn't carry the overhead with

838
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:31,200
what it cost to you know to operation in

839
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,720
Canada legally was just it made no sense

840
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,440
it just it's not much different in the

841
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,600
US right now for a lot of the the big

842
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,600
seed makers here it's getting so

843
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,038
prohibitively restrictive and and people

844
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,519
think that because you know they hear in

845
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,558
other states that it's more legal even

846
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,880
in California and and realistically it's

847
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,440
less legal to grow more legal to buy and

848
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,080
that's when the quality dips and the

849
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,880
prices licenses Skyrocket you know yeah

850
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:58,119
yeah yeah yeah it's interesting down

851
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,120
here I think they're I like the design

852
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:03,000
how they're doing the laws down here and

853
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,918
it's it's not cost prohibitive it's not

854
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,159
it's harder for a big uh corporations to

855
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,838
monopolize the way they set it up here

856
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,079
and they've kept it Community Based and

857
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:17,599
club- based for around the communities

858
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,119
so so yeah as an OM

859
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,159
or a company company that wants to sell

860
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:27,559
weed um you can grow up to 1,300 plants

861
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,639
with the with your patients and and the

862
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,719
prices here are double or triple of that

863
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:36,399
we that we get for it in Canada like

864
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:38,039
almost 10 US dollars a gram wow um in

865
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,239
Canada you can barely sell it for three

866
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:43,199
or four dollars a gram yeah it's C so

867
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,358
low so yeah here it's amazing how high

868
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,799
the price is and how the low the cost of

869
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,838
production is so yeah so for for me it's

870
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,960
a no-brainer is there is there a

871
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:56,519
connoisseur quality Market there to be

872
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,800
had yet yes there is yes well I've got a

873
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:01,440
few people people talking about their

874
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,200
opening dab bars and places in clubs

875
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,240
like that but it's like anywhere they

876
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:09,480
have your price range from your $5 a

877
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:12,118
gram weed to your $12 a gram weed um for

878
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,480
the top top quality but a lot of people

879
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,200
here don't know the top quality yeah

880
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,358
stuff so when you show it it's it's

881
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:23,719
mindboggling to them oh I'm sure I'm

882
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:25,639
sure it's just making its way down yeah

883
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,159
and and the skills of the local Growers

884
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,679
are are coming up pretty fast yeah so I

885
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,719
mean it's farming it's a farming world

886
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,919
it's a farming Community right they

887
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,879
shouldn't take them too long to figure

888
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,358
out how this plant works and operates

889
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,480
and what we want out of it you know

890
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,358
exactly but the good stuff is still

891
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,800
being uh grown indoors here because

892
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:49,719
Outdoors is the humidity Factor but um I

893
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,240
don't know I I yeah I've seen a lot of

894
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,519
my strains being grown here um and well

895
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,039
locals don't know there difference

896
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,480
between indoor and outdoor and it it

897
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:02,639
kicks ass so I'm happy I'm I'm

898
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,838
very how how's the electrical um

899
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:07,719
infrastructure there are you able to run

900
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:09,759
big light grows there it's it's it's

901
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,399
very very difficult to find the right

902
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,960
property with enough electricity because

903
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,920
the average house here um even my hostel

904
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,358
downtown uh has only 40 amps oh [ __ ] I I

905
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,400
I can't barely turn on more than three

906
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,199
air conditioners in in the in the Hostel

907
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,280
at a time without blowing the breakers

908
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:29,399
so it's

909
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,720
inside the city it's you know I can't

910
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,639
grow there obviously um but you have to

911
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,159
get a farm and once you have a farm

912
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,400
though the sun is the weather is great

913
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,239
here all year around so basically you

914
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,358
have the bedrooms to keep your clones

915
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,239
and the mothers alive and just yeah keep

916
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:48,759
keep feeding the green houses um from

917
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,039
plants from the indoors um so yeah

918
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,560
that's that's been one of my biggest

919
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:53,800
interests in in a lot of people moving

920
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,639
to Thailand or any of these rural areas

921
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,000
in South America was the electrical

922
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,879
infrastructure for a lot of us that are

923
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,079
used to doing like big indoor operations

924
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
for our seeds and granted it's not it's

925
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,960
not really economical to do that in the

926
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,519
United States anymore either it's become

927
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,960
so expensive per kilowatt hour and

928
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,639
everything people are looking to

929
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,480
different methods yeah well some of the

930
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,480
places I've been looking at this just

931
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,599
the way they build the uh structures

932
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,920
here in the houses it's usually a you

933
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,160
can rent like usually on the main floor

934
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,880
will be a store or a restaurant or a

935
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,960
mechanic shop a place like that and then

936
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,280
the apartment's above it so I'm looking

937
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,159
kind of for an entire building

938
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,960
uh so if you have a mechanic shop or a

939
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:34,480
restaurant you know you have no shortage

940
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,920
of uh of uh electricity yeah good point

941
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,800
so those those type of locations um for

942
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,358
a place in the city but most of my

943
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,960
growing I like to do out in the country

944
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:49,039
so yeah so yeah that's we're looking for

945
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,159
that right now um for a country place so

946
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,519
so right now what kind of strange do you

947
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:56,279
have stocked with uh with

948
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,400
Taylor um pretty much our whole catalog

949
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
um we still have it well stocked there's

950
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,280
a few actually strains that aren't on

951
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,519
the on our site yet that that I should

952
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,079
be I should get on work done on that but

953
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:10,679
I have a really good Avalon cvd nice

954
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,240
that's so it's got that Avalon strength

955
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:16,639
outdoors and beautiful purple buds uh

956
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,239
but a lot more for people who are like

957
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,598
maybe hearing you for the first time can

958
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,598
you tell us more about evalon I know

959
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,920
it's one of your like Flag ship names

960
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,079
but yeah um that was actually the very

961
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,159
first strain I I read back in Canada I

962
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:33,318
believe it was

963
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:36,199
95 or 96 it was a a Afghani hash plant

964
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:38,519
crossed with the uh original blueberry

965
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:42,639
that we had back then in the mid late

966
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:45,559
90s and uh I did that first cross

967
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:49,719
outdoors and I've been selectively

968
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:52,880
inbreeding it now for almost 30 years

969
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,799
yeah so but I I did all my selecting in

970
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,119
that genetics Outdoors on Vancouver

971
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,920
Island in on a rainy rainy windy part of

972
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,960
the island so it's you know the first

973
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,079
few years when I was doing the selecting

974
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,920
of what I was breeding with you know you

975
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,039
get that first year you lose half of it

976
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,119
to Bud rot but then you breed with the

977
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,279
best plants that made it through it and

978
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,760
after several years or decade of me

979
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,960
selectively breeding Outdoors it be just

980
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,760
became so uh resistant to molds and and

981
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,039
and

982
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,680
fungus and it can it can sit out in the

983
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,000
rain for two weeks and you're not going

984
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,879
to get a lot of Bud Rock um and it'll

985
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,119
put up with wind and that's what I

986
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,079
that's what I read it for just something

987
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,519
that's for the W West Coast where it's

988
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,960
wet all the time

989
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:40,480
so and few of the hybrids with that are

990
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,679
just amazing like my my blue Dynamite

991
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,639
which is the Avalon crossed with the the

992
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:49,799
grapefruit Dynamite same thing um um and

993
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:53,879
it's the buds right now are they're just

994
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,960
just the most Picture Perfect blue blue

995
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,519
uh Buds and that's that's the one seed

996
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,039
that's been flying off the shelves for

997
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,639
us right now and everybody once they

998
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,318
grow it they're they're coming back for

999
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:06,000
more so if anybody wants to try any one

1000
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:09,519
strain of ours right now that wants them

1001
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,960
to uh be impressed try our blue Dynamite

1002
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,079
yeah that's a really popular one too I

1003
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,119
got to smoke a bunch of the Avalon space

1004
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,920
recently oh sweet yeah it's nice bro

1005
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,200
it's nice it does have a lot of this

1006
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,880
what people don't realize is that like

1007
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,159
the sweet pink grapefruit to me at least

1008
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,960
does resemble Skittles a lot in the T

1009
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,598
profile and it was already existing long

1010
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,358
before Skittles uh it's very similar in

1011
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,440
the tur profile almost identical in many

1012
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:36,000
ways and I I wouldn't be surprised if

1013
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,159
they were related in some way shape or

1014
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,639
form because it's so similar and uh

1015
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,879
sometimes it's not just like the popular

1016
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:43,118
name go find out what's in it go go talk

1017
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,440
to people who've been around for a long

1018
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,760
time and you'll learn about this kind of

1019
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,240
stuff yeah yeah there's there's a lot of

1020
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,000
uh yeah who knows what's in a lot of

1021
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:54,479
this and people R all the time so yeah

1022
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,880
yeah but it was super nice dude like it

1023
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,800
it did look like you're saying it looked

1024
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,960
like indoor IND Bud grown outdoor which

1025
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,240
is it's hard to do and and I I like to

1026
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,920
recommend your stuff for people in

1027
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,919
coastal climates in the US because it is

1028
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,200
so hardy and mold resistant and it's

1029
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,720
proven in true for that yeah yeah

1030
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,039
exactly cool so the the Avalon space

1031
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,118
that you tried uh was that indoor or

1032
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:19,000
Outdoors outdoor outdoor window oh sweet

1033
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,358
oh okay sweet sweet yeah our buddy R is

1034
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,800
a big fan of yours so he's always

1035
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:24,239
growing some uh some of your your stuff

1036
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,720
yeah yeah that's that's actually a

1037
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,000
strain we I have quite a few seeds still

1038
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,439
sitting there not too many people bought

1039
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,280
it because I'm shitty at marketing so I

1040
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,599
haven't really told that to but uh but

1041
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,440
and they're only available in regular

1042
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,119
seeds I believe good or maybe I'm wrong

1043
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,960
it's been a while I think those were he

1044
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,680
think it say regular on your website

1045
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,639
what was the space that what was that

1046
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:51,279
one um it was just another variety from

1047
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,879
a big medical Club in um in British

1048
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,400
Columbia okay uh back back country

1049
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,440
Harvest they had a 11 Acre Farm and they

1050
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,960
have did a massive fenal hunt and this

1051
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,240
is one of the cuts off of their Farm

1052
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,039
aesome yeah they had really impressive

1053
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,559
Farm up in the mountains and uh how

1054
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:13,920
would you describe

1055
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:17,440
it uh the cut the cut um it's very it's

1056
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,720
silvery um and and more of a lime green

1057
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,159
not not a deep dark green uh really

1058
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,239
silvery I guess not the flavor would

1059
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,000
come from the Avalon more the space

1060
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,000
didn't have a lot of intense flavor on

1061
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,639
its own but extremely

1062
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,920
resinous and and light green flowers and

1063
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:37,799
that's what did get the high bread with

1064
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,880
the Avalon Avalon brought the flavor to

1065
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,599
that and the hard that's for sure yeah

1066
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,960
that's the first thing I could taste was

1067
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,519
was sweet pink grapefruit I was like oh

1068
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,240
yeah I know this one oh okay some

1069
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:51,119
grapefruit hint okay yeah had a lot of a

1070
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:53,159
lot of grapefruit in it was really

1071
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,160
nice is there anything else you want to

1072
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,558
highlight as far as your

1073
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,799
strains um right now well actually yeah

1074
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,960
the our um our red

1075
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,318
truffles okay tell us we got that's U

1076
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,280
that's a a Colombian red okay with red

1077
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,880
Truffles and it's one variety that out

1078
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,079
of all my varieties people ask me about

1079
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,119
for making H hash or full melt

1080
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,960
bubble the the red truffles that res

1081
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,000
just melts in your hand yeah and the

1082
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,318
tricomb separate really easy for making

1083
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,159
bubble if you want to make a lot of

1084
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:32,880
bubble and uh and that's one that yeah

1085
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:35,440
I'm gonna do um soon as I can uh doing a

1086
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,720
big feno hunt for it here uh just for

1087
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,960
bubble has production yeah that sounds

1088
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:43,239
good dude and they're large large

1089
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,440
plants so yeah and yeah the Colombian

1090
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:50,479
red obviously the sativa in there yeah

1091
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,760
but I don't know like on that one that

1092
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,119
one probably about about nine and a half

1093
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,520
weeks something like that yeah somewhere

1094
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,240
between nine and 10 yeah depending on

1095
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:03,199
the fertilizers you you use so yeah yeah

1096
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,519
that's right uh what was looking through

1097
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,118
The Offspring like for that because

1098
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:09,960
that's kind of a the you know the two

1099
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:13,440
parents I imagine could hardly be less

1100
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,920
similar um yeah well you guys know I I

1101
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,639
know my Colombian red but uh this was

1102
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,280
just a really other good cut I got of a

1103
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:21,558
medical company in Canada that the

1104
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,720
truffles uh and you guys probably know

1105
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:27,599
way more about the TRU than I do I just

1106
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:30,598
know it dumped hash and I did the hybrid

1107
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,599
and it dumped even more

1108
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,040
hash excellent yeah I don't know the

1109
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,519
actual truffles much of the history I'm

1110
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:40,318
sure you guys I actually don't know much

1111
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,920
other than it's a cookies variety of

1112
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:46,159
some sort inbred cookies of some I think

1113
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,559
yeah yeah yeah something like that me

1114
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,838
neither I don't know exactly what's in

1115
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,720
it yeah I haven't kept myself up to date

1116
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,719
on a lot of what's going on in the US

1117
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:57,358
for the genetics because it just seems

1118
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:00,078
like it's changes so fast but it's

1119
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,119
mostly the same genetics being renamed

1120
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,720
inbred yeah it is it's all for the last

1121
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,358
last 10 or 12 years ever since yeah I

1122
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:10,118
just I quit paying

1123
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,199
attention just work on my own

1124
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,920
stuff and look for some lambers so since

1125
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,719
I've had the show I've had to pay more

1126
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,200
attention to it because people always

1127
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,838
ask about these certain things but yeah

1128
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,399
I just don't really I'd rather I'd

1129
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,880
rather learn about the old BC strains

1130
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,400
from guys like you you know what I mean

1131
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,640
and talk about that as opposed to the

1132
