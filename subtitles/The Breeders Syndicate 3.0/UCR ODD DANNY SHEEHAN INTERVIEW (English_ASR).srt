back in 1977

denied access to this information and by

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
george h.w bush who was at that time the

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,120
director of the central intelligence

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,198
agency and president carter

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,718
commissioned a major secret study to be

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,039
done by the congressional research

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,520
service the the science and technology

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,840
division i was contacted by marsha smith

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,879
who was the director of that project

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,198
and asked initially if i could uh get at

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,438
the information that was in the vatican

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,519
archives because i was legal counsel the

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,279
jesuit national headquarters in their

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,039
office of social ministry their public

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,719
policy office

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
when that when we were unable to get

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,798
that information i was later asked by

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,438
marcia to

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,320
go and deliver a closed-door three-hour

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,959
presentation to the top 50 scientists of

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,839
the jet propulsion laboratory the seti

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,679
program on the theological implications

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,920
of contact with an extraterrestrial

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
civilization because of my position at

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,719
the jesuit headquarters

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,280
in that context i asked marsha smith if

46
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,478
we could get at the classified portions

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640
of project blue book uh so i could use

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,640
that to prepare this this presentation

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,879
that i was asked to make to the top

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
scientist and setting and it was in that

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,599
context that i actually physically got

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
access to the classified portions of

53
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,399
project blue book and i saw photographs

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,559
not just photographs in the sky of some

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,519
bright light jiggling around or not even

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,519
a

57
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,599
some kind of a craft that looks like you

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,799
can kind of doctor it in the sky but

59
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,878
this was a crashed ufo uh saucer there

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
wasn't any doubt about it that had the

61
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,239
photographs of it i saw several

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
photographs that had plowed through this

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,840
field that was covered with snow was

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
stuck in the side of an embankment

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
and it was it was actually being

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,879
photographed by us air force personnel

67
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,039
uh in in with cameras and stuff all

68
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,679
around it in the photographs and i was

69
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,560
actually able to trace the markings on

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
the side on the the the dome part of

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,080
this the saucer that were nothing they

72
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,239
were not any kind of uh planetary uh

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
language at all they were a set of

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,280
symbols that were on the side of the uh

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,840
the dome of this craft and so i saw that

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
and so i knew perfectly well that that

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,598
was true and i bro i brought it back to

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
jesuit headquarters and i showed it to

79
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,000
father william j davis who was my jesuit

80
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,479
superior at the at the headquarters of

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,878
the jesuit order and he reached down and

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,039
slid opened a drawer in his desk and

83
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,439
took out a little manila folder

84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,039
and handed it to me and i unlatched it

85
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,000
and i pulled it out and it was a little

86
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,919
uh

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,318
eight and a half by 11 black and white

88
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,238
glossy photograph of a ufo you know

89
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,719
perfectly clear that it was a ufo and i

90
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,280
said where did you get this and he said

91
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,800
well my sister dodie gave it to me and i

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,719
said well where did dodie get it she

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
said her husband michael gave it to her

94
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,598
he was the air traffic controller up in

95
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,919
uh seattle washington and his best

96
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,399
friend who was a commercial pilot took

97
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,039
this photograph out of the cockpit

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,640
window of a ufo that was that was

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,479
tracking his plane uh and and he the

100
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,039
pilot didn't want to get in any trouble

101
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,560
about this by reporting it officially so

102
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,959
he said look i'm going to bring it to my

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,199
best friend mike who is the air traffic

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,759
controller here in seattle

105
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,438
he gave him the copy of the photo and

106
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,359
michael didn't want to get in trouble by

107
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,759
reporting it so he took it and gave it

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,760
to dodie his wife and he said here dodie

109
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,000
take this and give it to your brother

110
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,199
he's a priest

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,598
right

112
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,438
so billy billability kept us in his desk

113
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,438
and when i showed him what i had found

114
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,598
in the in the art in the project blue

115
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,478
book he showed me that photo so that was

116
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,639
one of the two instances in which i was

117
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,758
convinced that this was real

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,040
the second one was at roswell that i had

119
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,400
i had uh must have been 1995 96

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
something like that

121
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,719
i was in the process of representing dr

122
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,638
john mack at harvard university uh who

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,560
was in this well-known confrontation

124
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,079
with the harvard faculty over the fact

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
that he had published this book called

126
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,240
abductions uh

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
human contact with aliens

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,879
etc and in that context i was invited to

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,680
go to the international ufo congress out

130
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,439
in laughlin nevada to do a presentation

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
to give them an update on how we were

132
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,279
doing in the litigation

133
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,000
uh and so a guy came up out of the

134
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,279
audience uh and said to me mr sheehan i

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,519
need to meet with you about something

136
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,038
really important and so i did i met with

137
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,560
him with another fellow and i sat down

138
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,800
with him he said look i think i have

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,519
found the photographer who took that

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,918
famous photograph of general rainey you

141
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,599
know kneeling down in front of that the

142
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,319
balloon wreckage you know the weather

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,560
moon wreckage he said uh and i had

144
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,079
noticed in that that that photograph i

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
kept saying look at what is that that

146
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,279
raymie has in his hand he's got some

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
kind of a telegram or something in his

148
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,519
hand and and i had thought about that

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,759
many times and when the guy said look i

150
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,038
think i found the photographer that they

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
i said look it

152
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,719
if you can do that find out if that's

153
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,879
the photographer and see if there's any

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
chance that he still has the original

155
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,680
negatives of the photographs that he

156
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,000
took that night on july 9th the late

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,280
night of the july 8th and early morning

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
of july 9th in 1947 if he still has them

159
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,519
i know some people we can get some

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
financing and we can digitize those

161
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,599
negatives and get them blown up and we

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
can see if we can read that telegram

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,240
that raymie has in his hand and it turns

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
out that he tracked a guy down and it

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,879
was the photographer he did have the

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,079
negatives we got the negatives digitized

167
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,719
and blown up

168
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,038
and you could read the telegram and we

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
actually subjected it to to a

170
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,879
computer analysis so it were some of the

171
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,799
places where there were creases in the

172
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,360
in the telegram that you couldn't quite

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,199
tell what the letter was in or that we

174
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
subjected it to a computer that could

175
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,879
tell whether it you know it was a

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
consonant or a vowel or whatever it was

177
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,879
and we reconstructed that and it said

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,240
you know take the disc to right field

179
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,879
and bring the bodies of the crash

180
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,960
victims and it said that in the telegram

181
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
that raymie had in his hand

182
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,799
not thinking that in a thousand years

183
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
that anybody would ever be able to read

184
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,038
it and the dumb guy brought it with him

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,038
for the and got the photograph taken to

186
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,639
him standing there holding his hand so i

187
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,399
said look at here are the two things

188
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
these are the two most convincing pieces

189
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,159
of evidence i can tell you this if i put

190
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,198
that evidence in front of an american

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
jury

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,400
the jury would conclude beyond any

193
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,240
reasonable doubt that the ufos were real

194
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,719
and that that those bodies that were

195
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,199
recovered there in in roswell were from

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
an extraterrestrial civilization uh so

197
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
those are the two pieces of evidence

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,439
that i thought personally were the most

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,360
convincing for me okay so real quick uh

200
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,800
andy wanted to ask a follow-up question

201
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,639
on something you said and then we've got

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,079
a five dollar donation that has a

203
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,918
question for john and i also wanted to

204
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,279
get john's thoughts on whoever's phone's

205
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,198
going off if you could silence it that

206
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,038
would be great no worries either way uh

207
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,800
i know people are busy but real quick

208
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,079
john let's bring you in because i wanted

209
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,160
you i wanted to hear sort of your

210
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,839
rebuttal to the the two pieces of

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
evidence that danny found

212
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,399
um

213
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,319
you know the most convincing and then

214
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,638
we've also got a a quick question here

215
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
for you

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,079
well you're muted john so we definitely

217
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,400
know it's not your dings yeah sorry

218
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,639
sorry that was me trying to make sure uh

219
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,000
i i laughed at at rebuttal that you

220
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,079
automatically assumed that i was but

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,918
i don't know that's the guess

222
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,519
so you're gonna uh so there's a lot to

223
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,878
unpack there i i'm gonna start with the

224
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,159
latter piece of evidence first and i'm

225
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
gonna have to ask for a respectful

226
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
reminder on the first part the letter uh

227
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,759
walking into a courtroom with a

228
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,199
uh artificial intelligence uh i would

229
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
say filling in the gaps you know to just

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
kind of quickly summer it

231
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,439
uh danny i've known you a long time so i

232
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,439
mean no disrespect and to say that i

233
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,839
would respectfully disagree with a an

234
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
attorney when i'm not an attorney uh

235
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,878
makes me a little uncomfortable but i

236
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,038
think i would respectfully disagree in

237
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
the sense that if you showed a jury that

238
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,719
that you had to get a computer to fill

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,799
in the blanks uh they would say you'd

240
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,639
have to do better um and and i think

241
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,079
that we would need to

242
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:41,038
really dissect uh the claims of you know

243
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,399
what it was about roswell but sadly i

244
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,399
think there are so many holes in the

245
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,799
roswell story at this point we've lost

246
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
all the witnesses so now we're going on

247
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,399
messi's second third and even

248
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,720
fourth-hand information of he said she

249
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,360
said that's challenging in a courtroom

250
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,240
and and i often often liken

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,800
this debate away from roswell but ufos

252
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,560
and uaps as a whole as stepping into a

253
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,079
courtroom and proving your case and i

254
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,039
i've had to do that

255
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,000
uh in foia appeals now hundreds and

256
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:13,360
hundreds of times i've done 10 000 plus

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,440
foias in 25 years appeals i have no idea

258
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,440
to be honest with you how many i've done

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
uh it's definitely not thousands though

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,120
uh just just simply because

261
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
it took me years to realize that the

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,039
appeal process actually does work and i

263
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,439
always recommend people to do it so i've

264
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,599
appealed a lot more but when you get to

265
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
the appeal process then you get into

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,278
essentially making your case when you

267
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
file a foia it could be a little bit

268
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,919
more of a fishing expedition when you do

269
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,278
an appeal process you got to sit down

270
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,799
and lay out the evidence of why you're

271
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,759
challenging a final determination and so

272
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,919
the

273
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,559
very wee little experience i've had with

274
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,240
that aspect of it that's just where i

275
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,319
would respectfully disagree about that

276
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,759
latter uh piece of the evidence

277
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
happy to address the first part but i'll

278
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,639
be honest with you uh i'm i'm just

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
drawing a blank on with them no no no no

280
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,679
no that's okay don't sweat it but let

281
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,200
because you're talking about the appeals

282
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,838
process so let's let's ask this question

283
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
here and it's

284
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,120
related saying

285
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,719
all right well there was two things that

286
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
kind of came up in the whole

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,360
conversation between everybody that just

288
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,639
went is um remember that there's two

289
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,320
different types of lies that you're

290
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,919
going to deal with with the government

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,399
you're going to be ones that are blatant

292
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,479
just to cover up some a blunder or some

293
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,320
type of mishap or just something they

294
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
just don't want to get out then you also

295
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
have

296
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,879
uh lies that are unfortunately actually

297
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,680
necessary for national security and

298
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,879
things like that and these lies are just

299
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,120
to as

300
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,919
you know counter espionage things like

301
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,240
that

302
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,879
so uh you know our job is to be able to

303
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
pick through that data find what's not

304
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,639
going to cause

305
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,519
the most horrible horrendous things and

306
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,360
then you know get our answers um and the

307
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,919
other thing is is danny said that he had

308
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,480
access to all the uh the the project

309
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,039
blue book files um along with the

310
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,440
pictures did you have the access to the

311
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,679
associated documents with those pictures

312
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
to get a clear identification of exactly

313
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,120
what you were looking for that it wasn't

314
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,519
like an experimental craft that they had

315
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,679
built and you know the passengers were

316
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
just you know i've heard honestly some

317
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
really horrible stories about what they

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
who they could actually be and we won't

319
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,039
go into that because a little too dark

320
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
for my taste but uh

321
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,278
no not mine but the public uh but it's

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,440
uh

323
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,078
i if i just wanted to know if you had

324
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,560
the associated paperwork with it and the

325
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,479
reports that describe the crash in

326
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,479
detail

327
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,920
yeah i know it's it's uh it was one of

328
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
those uh

329
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,240
mistakes i've made in the past uh one of

330
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,639
the things that once i got the

331
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,919
photographs uh and i saw the different

332
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,360
photographs there were like three or

333
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,000
four of the photographs from different

334
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,560
angles etc and and you could tell that

335
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the that the air force personnel that

336
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,679
were all around them were kind of

337
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,679
stunned and they were taking these

338
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,719
photographs and this kind of excited way

339
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,958
about this this crap as i say the the

340
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,240
key was that the symbols that were

341
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,799
around the edge of the dome uh were

342
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,959
symbols that were were not anything they

343
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,919
weren't any kind of uh

344
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,319
english or russian or chinese or any

345
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,039
kind of hieroglyphics or anything they

346
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
were a completely unique set of of

347
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,919
symbols that were all around the edge of

348
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,760
this this uh the dome of this thing

349
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,039
which led me to believe that look this

350
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:28,078
is not any language that i've ever seen

351
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:31,360
or anywhere near anything on our planet

352
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,278
that's what caused me to to think that

353
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
and then one of the problems was that

354
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,320
once i

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,560
they told me that i was not allowed to

356
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,360
take any notes uh or uh or anything else

357
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,359
in the in the room with the documents

358
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
i did and it's kind of a

359
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
infamous story now but i had this yellow

360
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,959
pad with me that i had under my arm and

361
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,440
i i opened it up in on the inside

362
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:59,599
cardboard of the yellow pad

363
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,480
i reduced the the picture from this uh

364
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,519
film

365
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,159
film strip thing that i had this uh from

366
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,639
what they call this little machine

367
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,199
machine that uh that i was using to see

368
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,399
the the documents and what i did is i

369
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,920
traced the exact letters that were in

370
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,919
this uh

371
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,919
around the dome with this thing

372
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,799
and i closed it up and because i knew

373
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,719
that i

374
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,240
had done something that they were i was

375
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,440
going to get in big trouble if i got

376
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,320
caught doing it what i did is i i put it

377
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,959
under my arm uh and i walked out of the

378
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,480
place really fast to get out of there

379
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,799
because i i thought that this was kind

380
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,519
of just positive and i've kicked myself

381
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,399
a thousand times between then 1977 and

382
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
now

383
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,559
i should have stayed there and i should

384
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,560
have started taking some notes on any of

385
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,599
the documents that were around that

386
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,838
referred to that but i didn't uh so i i

387
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,320
had the i saw the photographs and i saw

388
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,360
the the letters and i copied the letters

389
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,680
and then i left uh and so the the the

390
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,959
short answer to that is i i didn't go

391
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,559
digging into all the rest of the

392
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,479
documents not only that there was tons

393
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,759
of other stuff there i mean it was a

394
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,278
whole room like by you know maybe

395
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,919
20 feet wide by 15 feet deep and they

396
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,039
had these these folding tables with

397
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,599
these boxes these look like big shoebox

398
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,838
size things with these canisters of of a

399
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
microfiche in them and it was as soon as

400
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,199
i hit that particular set of photographs

401
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,278
i it says i was able to copy the letters

402
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,278
around the top of the dome or the edge

403
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,439
of the dome of that that crap that i

404
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,519
just got up and left uh and that was a

405
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,720
big mistake is that is that tracing

406
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,039
available anywhere have you made that

407
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,199
puppy have you have you framed that

408
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,120
that cardboard

409
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,039
i i brought it back to the jesuit

410
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,519
headquarters and i put it in the files

411
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,559
of the jesuit headquarters and when i

412
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,480
left the jesuit headquarters i took

413
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,638
my files with me

414
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
and when we we left we were doing the

415
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,198
big iran conference case this big

416
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
case that we had

417
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,759
uh dealing with the the off-the-shelf

418
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,680
enterprise and uh there there was an

419
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,799
attempt on the part of jack singlaub who

420
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,559
was the president of the world

421
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,319
anti-communist league

422
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,159
and and green and these other guys that

423
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
were the lawyers for oliver north and

424
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,000
and the other guys they were trying to

425
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,000
get a hold of our documents so what we

426
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,839
did is we we stacked up our documents

427
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,559
from this big 18-wheeler and moved them

428
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,480
to california uh and actually put them

429
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:29,359
in a uh a storage facility out there

430
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,440
uh uh out by the inland empire here in

431
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
california and there was this huge

432
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,600
massive storm this sounds like one of

433
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
those dumb

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,879
excuses you'd hear there's someone on

435
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,279
the stand and you turned to drink oh

436
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,000
yeah right you know but but the fact is

437
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,519
that

438
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
there was this big flood and they

439
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,320
flooded part of the documents that we

440
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,000
had stored

441
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,160
i didn't know for years which ones they

442
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,440
were but when we took the documents out

443
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,838
of there and moved them to jackson

444
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,759
browns ranch where we had them for years

445
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,839
uh when i finally went looking for that

446
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,600
particular file a whole section of our

447
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,880
jesuit files are the ones that got

448
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
flooded out

449
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,360
and that the people at the at the stores

450
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,959
facility had just thrown them out uh and

451
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,120
never even told us about it they even

452
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,439
gave us an option to look at them

453
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,519
but i've concluded over the years that

454
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,600
had to be one of the part of the

455
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,000
documents that got flooded out so we

456
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
don't have them uh so jamar i want to

457
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,440
bring you in here real quick uh because

458
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
i haven't heard that beautiful face yet

459
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,320
but what i want to add to that though

460
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,839
is the fact that there is such a

461
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,800
counter-intelligence value to the uap

462
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,440
topic that regardless of if there is a

463
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,799
extraterrestrial connection or not and i

464
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
and i do believe that that's a big

465
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,879
possibility for a portion of what we're

466
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,600
dealing with

467
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,720
the stuff that is not extraterrestrial

468
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,639
connected can absolutely be utilized by

469
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,399
the intelligence community and

470
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,600
counterintelligence operatives whatever

471
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,759
you want to say

472
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,600
as a way to muddy the public perception

473
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,919
of what we are dealing with

474
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,079
and it costs the government nothing

475
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,039
because the general public will take

476
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:06,078
just a little tiny nugget and blow it

477
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:08,078
into something that it's not so the the

478
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,759
answer is it extraterrestrially

479
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,318
connected or not

480
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,959
then becomes irrelevant because the

481
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,879
portion that definitely isn't

482
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,240
they can use it and start throwing

483
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
things out there like oh yeah we're

484
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
totally we're totally clueless and i

485
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,559
point to the official inside

486
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,640
communication of the united states air

487
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,639
force obtained through foia

488
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
that talked about the

489
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,960
all with clearance holders and in public

490
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,519
affairs offices and so on it was the

491
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,519
internal communications that the navy

492
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,480
put out the statement to me in september

493
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,679
of 2019 uh that they had no idea what

494
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,200
those videos were first time they ever

495
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,200
acknowledged that

496
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,798
and then when you juxtaposed that with

497
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,480
the air force

498
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,000
internally and again these were not

499
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
public statements i had to fight for the

500
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
documents

501
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,840
internally the air force is going yeah

502
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,200
the navy says they're unidentified but

503
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:06,879
we're talking about uas's and drones and

504
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,200
the media turns it into ufos and aliens

505
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,440
and it really gives an insight that

506
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,120
number one military agencies don't

507
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,519
really know what the other one thinks

508
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,719
does or they agree with each other but

509
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,879
number two

510
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,200
look at the value of that because now we

511
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,720
don't know as the general public we just

512
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
don't know what to believe is it alien

513
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,558
is it not could it be could it be do

514
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,400
they have the answers do they not and

515
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,038
again that ci value the counter

516
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
intelligence value of this topic whether

517
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,119
or not it's alien is something that

518
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,520
they're going to utilize so that i

519
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,439
believe jamal if that that answers your

520
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,200
question that they will use that to

521
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
their advantage because in the process

522
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,880
it confuses russia it confuses china it

523
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,199
may confuse iran it will confuse all of

524
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,440
the powers that either we are trying to

525
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,558
play nice in the sandbox with or we're

526
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,558
not it confuses all of them to wait a

527
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,038
minute does their intelligence community

528
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,879
really not realize that that's a balloon

529
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,599
or that's a drone or wait a minute

530
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,679
that's us they're really clueless again

531
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,079
it's that confusion from the ci

532
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,679
perspective that i think is i mean is

533
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,319
what's going on capacity to to seek

534
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,240
information that is classified and they

535
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,480
can seek the authority to get it

536
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,440
declassified so they can have access to

537
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,038
it uh and and that this was undertaken

538
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,360
by the congressional research service

539
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,558
science and technology division at my

540
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,719
request

541
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,038
as special counsel to them and that

542
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,440
marsha smith who was the head of the

543
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,919
science and technology division of the

544
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,759
of the congressional research service

545
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,240
when i put the request to her to have

546
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,319
that get access to the the classified

547
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,839
portions of project blue book she just

548
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,319
came back to me

549
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,558
a couple weeks later totally surprised

550
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,240
uh that they had agreed to do this that

551
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,000
when i asked her to see if we could get

552
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,798
access to it so i could help prepare

553
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,798
this this presentation to the the seti

554
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,279
program uh at the jet propulsion

555
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,558
laboratory in pasadena california

556
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,038
we she didn't think they were going to

557
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,440
agree to do it and so she was surprised

558
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,079
that they had agreed to this and so she

559
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,279
simply told me yes i had a right to come

560
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,960
and see this

561
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,440
i had to bring two forms of photo

562
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,360
identification and i went over to the

563
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,720
the madison building which was the brand

564
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,399
new wing of the library of congress and

565
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,960
they had delivered

566
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,600
this these files and they were in this

567
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,600
room downstairs in the basement

568
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,599
of the madison building uh and there was

569
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,759
nobody even there it wasn't even open

570
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,439
yet it was brand new it just been built

571
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,279
uh so when i went in there were two

572
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
suits that were standing in front of the

573
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,798
door

574
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,600
uh when i arrived uh who checked out my

575
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,839
passport and my driver's license uh and

576
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,918
then i was allowed into the building and

577
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,599
i went down the hall into an elevator

578
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
they pointed out and went down into the

579
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,639
basement and there were these other two

580
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,038
suits in front of this room uh and and i

581
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,120
don't i don't know you know exactly what

582
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,919
agencies they were from

583
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,639
i don't know uh you know but i never got

584
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,720
a clearance that i because bob fink who

585
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,120
was the the chief investigator for bella

586
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,839
abzug who was the congresswoman from new

587
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,678
york who chaired the senate or the house

588
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,759
uh judiciary committee subcommittee on

589
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,640
human rights always said to me said do

590
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,359
not ever accept a classification

591
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,600
a security clearance because you can

592
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,639
find out virtually anything you want to

593
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,719
know

594
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
without doing that you got the kind of

595
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
contacts you got the kind of access to

596
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,919
people you don't want to have that

597
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
because what they'll do is attribute

598
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,360
everything that you've ever discovered

599
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
from any other source they'll attribute

600
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,959
it to your security clearance

601
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,158
and they'll stop you from talking about

602
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,798
it publicly

603
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,720
so i've refused to accept the security

604
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,038
clearance you know and so that i didn't

605
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,240
get a clearance to see that i'm going to

606
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,400
uh can i

607
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,759
just uh yeah please please john yeah and

608
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
quickly we'll go to andy

609
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,279
i have to ask so if you didn't because i

610
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,798
know judges and and attorneys sometimes

611
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,000
get the in-camera clearances so if you

612
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,519
shut that down

613
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,240
okay um how can crs divulge

614
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,480
or whatever agencies were in the hallway

615
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,558
divulge classified information

616
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
and that's okay

617
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,079
they didn't i did

618
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,759
well no they they brought classified

619
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,079
records

620
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,759
to you right you said boxes well they

621
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,678
brought them they brought them to the

622
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,200
library of congress they were over the

623
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,640
library of congress at the madison

624
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,640
building downstairs in the basement

625
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,840
and again my interview uh er part is

626
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,319
taking over i'm just curious then how

627
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,558
could they allow a civilian to go in

628
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,038
attorney legal background or not without

629
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,798
the proper clearance to just open up and

630
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,839
see a picture of what you said was an

631
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,759
alien

632
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,119
spacecraft from the classified files of

633
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,480
blue book like

634
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,399
i don't know i don't know i don't know

635
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,960
whether they temporarily declassified

636
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,720
the files or what they did all i know is

637
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,558
they brought them there uh and there

638
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,279
were there must have been

639
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:03,038
20 20 25 boxes of these these uh these

640
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,119
light green

641
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,038
shoebox size things with these micro

642
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,839
fish in them and they were all in this

643
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,679
room on these folding tables in the room

644
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,879
downstairs in the madison building and

645
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,159
it was like

646
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,679
must have been

647
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,600
i don't know february uh march or it was

648
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,280
i don't believe there was even snow i

649
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,719

650
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:27,440
so of 197

651
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,759
uh when they did it uh and that's where

652
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,200

653
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,558

tried to replicate them and then

660
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,759
without reading the documents included

661
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,240

662
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,640
the context of the photos you know even

663
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,120
a ts project could make soldiers say

664
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,520
what they have so i just was wondering

665
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,158
those two things okay yeah no the the

666
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,839
the uh uh i'll show you that

667
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,559
the i was always very careful because

668
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,359
the the i copied them traced them

669
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:10,000
literally in the exact sequence that

670
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,798
those symbols were were there at the

671
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,720
base of the at the base of the dome

672
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,839
but i'll show you i don't know if you

673
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
can see this

674
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,079
can you see here where where am i here

675
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,319
yeah yeah just put prop it up there you

676
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,079
go yeah see let me i'll show you i'll

677
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,000
show you exactly what they look like but

678
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,759
i don't know what the sequence is i

679
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,599
don't remember the exact sequence they

680
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,599
were in but they were they were like

681
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,599
this

682
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,038
i want to see how close my guess was

683
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,400
because i drew some stuff like oh what

684
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,720
did you draw it

685
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,960
okay

686
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,120
what does that mean andy

687
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,759
i'll tell you later

688
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,719
i think i know oh what do you think it

689
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,839
is

690
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,480
well i don't know i want to give

691
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,639
anything away but

692
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,720
uh lift it up just a little yeah okay

693
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,799
you see this yeah a little uh you know

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,038
what let's uh let's let's hold on a

695
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,200
second there uh let's blow you up real

696
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,200
quick danny okay okay

697
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,759
that's that's that's what they they were

698
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,919
a series of of uh straight lines like

699
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,599
that pointing either from the lower left

700
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,440
to the upper right or from the upper

701
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,639
left to the lower right and they had

702
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,679
these these a series of uh series of

703
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
dots

704
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,640
in in little uh little uh

705
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,278
u-shaped things like this

706
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
okay right right here and dots like this

707
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,159
different sequences of dots and they

708
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,120
were all around the the bottom of the

709
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,080
dome of the of the of the craft like

710
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,759
this

711
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,319
they were they were along the bottom of

712
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,839
the dome of the craft all right i lied i

713
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,079
got one more question all right so

714
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,558
that's that's very that's very similar

715
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,399
to uh cuneiform have you have you tried

716
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,798
to match it uh based off of different

717
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,440
dialects of cubic form yes i have this

718
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,839
is not cuneiform it's not cuneiform it

719
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,480
was not it was it was these things here

720
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,240
and that that all kinds of physical

721
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,640
structures have some similarities to

722
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640
other physical stretches but these were

723
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
these were unique uh they were they did

724
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,320
not match when i was at the headquarters

725
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:10,558
we checked it out they did not match any

726
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:15,158
other kind of of communication

727
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,158
andy that did that answer your question
