00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,919
welcome to breeders syndicate where we

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,359
explore the history of a clandestine

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,800
scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
lived it i'm matthew owner of riot seeds

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,719
i'll occasionally be joined by my

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
co-host not-so-dog breeder and grower

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,839
from mendocino

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,839
welcome to the underground

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,160
one of the things that we might start

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,238
with is just sort of like we keep

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
getting questions on

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,280
you know we talk a lot about on various

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,760
shows and it's certainly a big thing on

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,359
instagram and other places of media

16
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,280
of like

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,280
how many different directions

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
the scene is going that we don't like

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,640
yeah right and you know we've so we've

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,719
spent a bunch of time talking about like

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
various effects and all that and then

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
people keep suggesting well what if we

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,719
talked about things that we could do or

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
you know on that level or something

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,800
destructive something constructive

26
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,319
perhaps or something that like even

27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,959
someone who's not very connected or

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,118
whatever on any level could accomplish

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,118
right and so that like that resonated

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,200
with me pretty good because

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,599
it is uh it is better to talk about

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
constructive things

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,438
you know than it is to i mean it's

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,280
important to like discuss the problem so

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,359
people know what's going on

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
right but then it's like it can it can

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,599
definitely seem insurmountable

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,118
it does and right now is a really easy

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,798
time for it to filter insurmountable

40
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,879
when there's so many different

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
um problems coming at cannabis in

42
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,158
general from so many different

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
directions as we see it

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
yeah and so you know i kind of do this

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,799
thing fairly often on the discord where

46
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,478
i'll throw i'll throw out some questions

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,759
for everybody to see what they want to

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,519
hear talked about

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,359
um and you know sometimes people come up

50
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,759
with some pretty good some pretty good

51
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,799
angles on things on top of that so we

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,478
might delve into that too but um

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
i don't know you know yeah how to change

54
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:58,798
things where we're at

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
right

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
so

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
i think maybe

58
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,879
what what's really happening is that

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
anytime

60
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,679
you know

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,959
people really aren't adapted to fast

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
change

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,520
yeah right so there's been a lot of

64
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,679
changes happening really fast

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,719
and i think it makes people's heads to

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
some degree

67
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,680
um and it's happening fast enough that

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,879
like

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
you know i don't know if you think this

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,560
way matt but it's almost like every year

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200
or two is like a different scene

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,920
yeah especially now where that like that

73
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,518
maybe took like five or ten years

74
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,839
for like things to like seem

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,319
dramatically different on any level and

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
so big strain changes and stuff like

77
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,878
that yeah like strain you know strains

78
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,159
that got popular had a longer had a

79
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:47,359
longer like run time of popularity you

80
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,439
know um the laws change slower um you

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
know pricing and just you know there's a

82
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,318
lot of things that just seemed a little

83
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,959
bit more stable and now everything's

84
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,719
kind of rapid fire yeah right there's

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
rapid fire change and that makes people

86
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,158
uncomfortable right yeah people are

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,759
people are talking about there's a bunch

88
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,280
of stuff going on like right now on the

89
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,479
internet of like

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,479
you know the community's trying to

91
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,399
figure out like well who can you partner

92
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,518
with all these changes going on what is

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
ethical

94
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
yeah what's happening for the for

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,479
something that's been black market and

96
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:20,079
illicit and clandestine for so long it's

97
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,598
a different time kind of so what is okay

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
and things that weren't okay before that

99
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,759
would get you blacklisted may not be the

100
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,199
same today yeah so i mean and some of

101
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
that is just some of that is just

102
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,518
changing culture i mean you know i don't

103
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,039
want to be like old man yells at cloud

104
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,680
you know or whatever

105
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,959
because changes change but sometimes

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,040
uh

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,920
you know there's different forces now

108
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,679
than there used to be right um you know

109
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,479
and maybe the best way to put it in a

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,719
nutshell is that like before

111
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,959
all the forces against us were pretty

112
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,759
much in prohibition

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,000
yeah to a large degree right yeah and i

114
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,280
i've even been giving this some some

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,799
thought because there's people that are

116
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,318
getting roasted now for some of the

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
people they're partnering with and stuff

118
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,158
like that and they're fighting back and

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,438
i even think to some degree like maybe

120
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,120
the way

121
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,120
that people fight back against those

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,039
people like matt even for somebody like

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
you who like it used to be very

124
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,719
effective to call somebody out in the

125
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,079
community yeah

126
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,238
you know i don't know if that's even the

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,079
most effective path anymore right yeah i

128
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,839
i don't think it is

129
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
and it's hard sometimes for people who

130
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,279
have a

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,879
past of doing that constantly you know

132
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,198
you know one way to handle certain

133
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,478
situations but i think now it really is

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,478
a lot of beating your head against a

135
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,918
wall yeah i mean people are throwing out

136
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,839
the names and stuff like that that's

137
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,198
going on and you know what it's really

138
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,879
exposing is that you know there's uh

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,639
there's never been like this uber

140
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,879
ethical time in wheat

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,800
yeah weeds always been full of shady

142
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,360
characters you know for a long time it

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
was criminal in various regards

144
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,879
you know and so some people

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,319
you know um some people were in it just

146
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,759
because they felt like that was silly

147
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,959
and they loved weed

148
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
yeah and you know some people were right

149
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,638
because they were criminals yeah too you

150
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
know and that was just another criminal

151
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,918
[ __ ] to do or whatever and some people

152
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,279
are in it for rep and money and some

153
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,120
people learn it for the plan everyone

154
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,719
wants to say they're in it for the plan

155
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
yeah i mean that's a good thing to say

156
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
it's a good talking point but it isn't

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
necessarily true for everyone but what

158
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,879
people are noticing is by people's

159
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,639
associations now right now you're

160
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,120
starting to realize well like where do

161
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,800
those ethics lie

162
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,199
right and so there's and you know and

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,038
it's gone back i mean matt matt

164
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
remembers even like when colorado first

165
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,800
went legal there was people in colorado

166
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,038
that should remain nameless that got

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,038
into battles with buddies of ours

168
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,038
um about like well you know

169
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,279
go legal that's the option and if you

170
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,959
don't then you're unfair competition and

171
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,399
it's not even snitching or ratting to

172
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,159
like get you gone

173
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,918
yeah because you're just untaxed you're

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,320
not paying the same dues i am like

175
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,478
you're refusing to take the path

176
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,599
and so that was like a massive split in

177
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,439
the community

178
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,520
that was a that was a very big turning

179
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,439
point in the community when when it

180
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,839
became possible to

181
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,478
snitch people out to med boards and not

182
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,359
necessarily the police and at what point

183
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,560
is

184
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
yeah or whatever

185
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
you know or doxing

186
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,360
just a variety of pressure tactics to

187
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
get people off their back because a lot

188
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,080
of times

189
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,758
you know really what it boils down to is

190
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,359
there's people that are making

191
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,160
all kinds of choices about their own

192
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
personal future and their friends right

193
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
um and in some cases like when they get

194
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
exposed they don't want to be exposed

195
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
because

196
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,038
um they feel like that might hurt their

197
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,360
customer base sure

198
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,038
yeah right seat cells potentially which

199
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
could hurt their ability to partner with

200
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,719
some of these people because they have

201
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,879
to be useful to these bigger powers yeah

202
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
and stuff like that right and so

203
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,879
um so there's an aspect now where it's

204
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
like there's a lot of

205
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,240
there's a lot of secret snitching

206
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,879
there's a lot of doxing there's a lot of

207
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
like through proxies or whatever and and

208
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,918
how so

209
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,439
kind of what's happened is now is like

210
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,159
the community has sort of lost the

211
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,759
ability to police itself right

212
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
i can't even believe that word but it's

213
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,879
like now people are like you know it's

214
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,840
acceptable to work with police yeah

215
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,759
it is

216
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,519
you know like and be like oh this you

217
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,560
know and uh

218
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,519
yeah

219
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
so

220
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,918
i mean that that's about as 180 degree

221
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,959
sea change as you can possibly imagine

222
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,799
yeah right and so we're again we're

223
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,159
discussing issues now but really what it

224
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,038
boils down to

225
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
is

226
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,959
so

227
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,120
i look at it and i i talk about it uh in

228
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,598
my head like i think about this a lot

229
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
right where my whole life they've been

230
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,439
telling me for in regards to cannabis

231
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,119
that it's it's bad for you to have it

232
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,038
you can't have it you can't have it you

233
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
can't have it you can't have it right

234
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,879
yeah and we've all been fighting in this

235
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,360
in this community like you know the

236
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,439
overgrown overgrow was named

237
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919
right for people that don't know the

238
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,680
first real weed forum overgrow was named

239
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,318
because the concept was overgrow the

240
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,079
government yes like if too many people

241
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
start growing and so many people start

242
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,279
disobeying and people refuse to respect

243
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,360
the law then eventually they'll have to

244
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,198
change the law so that people keep

245
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,038
respect for other laws

246
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,598
yeah so that was like the whole that was

247
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,478
like the whole theory right was like was

248
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,079
uh

249
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,878
um

250
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,439
you know was overgrown yeah okay and so

251
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,520
now we have this that comes from um

252
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,719
warner i'm sorry

253
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,079
uh um

254
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,319
uh uh

255
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,758
god keys no

256
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,360
uh uh he's hawker

257
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,439
you know one of our friends might chime

258
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
in i'm not sure it's old school yeah it

259
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,918
was that concept it was him and bernard

260
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,838
mello yellow the whole thing his big

261
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,679
thing was to to get a bunch of hemp

262
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
plants give them out for free hemp

263
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,958
clones and say overgrow the government

264
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,278
here's how we're going to do it i'm

265
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,399
giving away all the hemp plants before

266
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,320
uh before 1996 when california actually

267
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
passed proposition 215 which was the

268
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
first medical in the country and it was

269
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,720
the first place to take it from totally

270
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
illegal to like a path towards like like

271
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
you can call it a gray area do you

272
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
remember when they used to push for like

273
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,639
to get like hundreds of thousands of

274
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,879
hippies to move to wyoming yeah because

275
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,958
it was so lightly populated we could

276
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,720
probably affect the vote and people were

277
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,879
trying to figure out well what state can

278
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,720
we actually get some movement

279
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,120
yeah right what state can we actually

280
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
get something and now we've overgrown to

281
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,080
the point where people are looking

282
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
around at prices uh and how to survive

283
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,278
and all the various things that are

284
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
happening and then like maybe man we

285
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,039
maybe we overgrew a bit too much yeah

286
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,120
and so that aspect that price dive that

287
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,799
worry that we talk about that's

288
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
caused a lot of people to look around

289
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,199
and and

290
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,320
and choices are being made yeah

291
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
right

292
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,680
yeah people are mentioning certain

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,240
choices right now i mean when we're

294
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,759
talking about choices um you can go back

295
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,639
to even the the roll-up of of how it

296
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,240
worked

297
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,919
and how the community reacted when we

298
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
saw things like icy mag and heaven's

299
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,919
stairway get taken down he was

300
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,919
mentioning shebang you know that was one

301
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,159
of the people that got taken down for

302
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,639
um i believe running icy mag and heaven

303
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,799
stairway somewhere after that when that

304
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,720
happened and was that o5

305
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,000
somewhere uh i see mac was later they

306
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,920
have the stairways right about 05. i

307
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,759
haven't i i mean heaven's stairway that

308
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,360
got like cannabis world and overgrowth

309
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,200
taken down yeah but it's all part of the

310
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
same bus it's all part of the same thing

311
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
when that happened i got scared enough

312
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,559
of the internet i honestly didn't really

313
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,559
start poking around again until

314
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,399
social media really came back on in the

315
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,879
mid teens yeah

316
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,200
i was scared off it for a while you know

317
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,838
make sense i got scared off i see mag

318
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,000
once the cops seized the servers i and

319
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,320
usually um yeah shebang is actually

320
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,839
there there's paperwork right now and

321
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,720
he's it he's in trial so yeah he did get

322
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,000
busted unfortunately um he got busted

323
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,920
with the server

324
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
and and top cops don't tend to give

325
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,439
servers back when they take them either

326
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,480
so a lot of people need to keep that in

327
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
mind

328
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,000
but you know that so there's an aspect

329
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
of uh

330
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,679
you know people are asking well what can

331
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,959
we do to change things positively

332
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,039
yeah right

333
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,639
um and you know there there's an aspect

334
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,319
where there i'm i'm not big on

335
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,919
mentioning names on the show or whatever

336
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
there's a bunch of comments going on but

337
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:11,199
obviously like there's a lot of stuff

338
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,399
going on recently on ig and and you know

339
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,720
people are talking about like

340
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,440
associations that people are doing

341
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,959
yeah right well you know you can you can

342
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
vote with your wallet

343
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,239
yeah

344
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,000
they're gonna try to hide their work and

345
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,000
off in different brands and different

346
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,519
this and different that you can figure

347
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,679
out who they are and you cannot spend

348
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,679
your money on them yeah right they

349
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,679
essentially need an enormous amount of

350
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,679
consumer money to stay afloat

351
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,519
always they're all doing this because

352
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,278
they think this is the best money play

353
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,919
for themselves

354
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,600
so the way to hurt them is to is to deny

355
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,799
that money play

356
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,399
yeah right is to you know you can so you

357
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,919
know maybe maybe i'll continue my

358
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,839
thought or whatever so my whole life

359
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,838
they can't have it you can't have it you

360
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,120
can't have it right and now we're at

361
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
this point where they're like man this

362
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,959
thing's kind of cool

363
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,759
i mean we'll take it from here

364
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,559
yeah

365
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,639
so to me the fight hasn't changed really

366
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,679
the fight has just shifted we used to

367
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,000
fight for

368
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,719
access and acceptance

369
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
yeah right that was the big fight access

370
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
acceptance and the ability to do that

371
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,399
without getting in trouble just because

372
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,360
it's a plan that's [ __ ] stupid yeah

373
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,799
so now we're kind of getting there

374
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,399
yeah we've made we've made way faster

375
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,319
expansion on access and and safety and

376
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
the ability to use it and i think with

377
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,879
within a number of years a lot of these

378
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
like piss testing for jobs will go away

379
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,559
i think there was something announced

380
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,879
today about that right in the news

381
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,239
i'm not sure actually but

382
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,799
it's going to go away soon because so

383
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,639
many states are led making it legal

384
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,078
um it's just going to you know and then

385
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
wide varieties of people are going to be

386
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,919
able to start using it without penalty

387
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,078
yeah it has something to do with jobs

388
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,240
not being able to discriminate in legal

389
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,838
states where there's medical cannabis

390
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
and yeah they're not allowed to

391
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,240
discriminate against legal cannabis if i

392
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,480
remember correctly so so here's the gig

393
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,639
when it as it shifts from like safety

394
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,039
and freedom and access

395
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,680
right and the right to do so now it's

396
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:12,639
going to shift to like who controls it

397
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,638
who sells it to you like who

398
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,959
um you know like

399
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
that really that who controls it

400
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,239
that's the fight and it probably will be

401
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,078
a fight that we're battling but what

402
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,079
people have to remember it's dark days

403
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,239
right now and

404
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,759
it's like a lot of people that are like

405
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,278
deeply in the cannabis industry are

406
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,039
hurting pretty bad

407
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,200
yeah which is why i think it's causing

408
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,120
some of these desperate moves

409
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
yes right is that when it comes down to

410
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,240
it there's people that like they want to

411
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
survive they want to make money and if

412
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
they have to deal with the devil they

413
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,278
will

414
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,919
right

415
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,958
but i would like to throw out there that

416
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,479
um

417
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,559
you know when it comes down to it that

418
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
we are winning

419
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,838
right it's just that the fight has

420
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
shifted

421
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,320
you know like we were fighting huh who's

422
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720
we that's winning well i mean in the

423
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,600
sense that like you know imagine 15

424
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,800
years ago if you thought that like 38 or

425
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,560
40 states in in in america would allow

426
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,958
recreational or

427
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,000
medical cannabis

428
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:15,198
right like there's more access for more

429
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,120
people now than ever before

430
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,599
right so we're not happy with the

431
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,159
direction the scene is going but that's

432
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
because our previous goal we were all

433
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,600
pretty united on

434
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,078
we want this thing to be available and

435
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,519
accessible and not get people in trouble

436
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,638
and we want to be able to smoke and

437
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
share weed

438
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,720
yeah and now it's gone into like this

439
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,480
economic thing where

440
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,759
people are like when you think about i

441
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
don't want to say corporations because

442
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,319
that's just like a group of people or

443
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
whatever but when you think about big

444
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
business say

445
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
yeah they're going to want to control it

446
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,879
they're going to want to patent it

447
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,639
they're going to want to make it look at

448
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,559
all the recreational stuff going on it's

449
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,198
not exactly legal

450
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,039
it's more like highly regulated tightly

451
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,958
taxed and controlled

452
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,240
yes you know

453
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,759
nothing decriminalized about it yeah i

454
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
mean if if i want to grow a bunch of

455
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,759
vegetables or tomatoes or fruit or

456
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
anything like that in my backyard i can

457
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,078
do that i can grow as many tomatoes as i

458
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,000
want i can cross tomatoes every person

459
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
on this on this thing tonight i could

460
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
send them tomato seeds yeah you could

461
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,120
send thousands of tomatoes yeah we could

462
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
all we could all trade and share and

463
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,879
post pictures of our hybrids and our

464
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
this and our that and everything else

465
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,759
and it would be free no one would give a

466
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,680
[ __ ] um that's legal

467
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,000
what we have is like so what we have

468
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,000
going on right now is that um you know

469
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,440
if you have a six plant limit for in

470
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,759
your state

471
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,720
you basically can't breed

472
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,720
yeah you can't keep mom stock you can't

473
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,639
have a normal amount of plants that a

474
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,920
per even a hobbyist

475
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
and this spirit

476
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,439
to me this is where the the term legal

477
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,320
legalization was bastardized and a lot

478
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,040
of uneducated even when i was 15 even

479
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
when i was 15 i knew that once

480
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,319
corporations got their hands dug in deep

481
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
enough to be able to take over

482
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,759
immediately that's when they're gonna

483
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
flip the bill even as a 15 year old kid

484
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,879
i realized that's how the world works

485
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,039
that's how corporations work

486
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,039
that's what happened but i did not

487
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,919
expect them to push it under the guise

488
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,759
of legalization because even today any

489
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,679
any average citizen who doesn't grow but

490
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,839
smokes and if you ask them if weed is

491
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,799
legal they're going to tell you yes 99

492
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
of the time they're going to tell you

493
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,719
yes and they don't even know what's

494
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,319
happening to the real growers side of

495
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
the aspect that there's nothing legal

496
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
about

497
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
being

498
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,000
they're making it legal in the sense to

499
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
possess or whatever but you still have

500
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,039
to go to approve stores

501
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,479
and buy it from approved vendors

502
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,120
and

503
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,120
as we both know that invites corruption

504
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,839
and all these different levels sure you

505
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,240
know and so strangely

506
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,519
and this might be like from a capitalist

507
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,000
perspective this might be one of the

508
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,320
first cases that i know of of this where

509
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,039
it's like uh

510
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,199
the legalization of something led to a

511
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,078
massive drop in quality and a massive

512
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,078
increase in price

513
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,720
hmm

514
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,240
yeah

515
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,838
i don't know about the massive increase

516
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
in price with the drop in quality that's

517
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,958
a hard one

518
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,038
you know well i mean there's think about

519
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,959
how many people are buying like 70 and

520
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,199
80 eighths

521
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,519
yeah

522
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,759
right yeah and think about how expensive

523
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,759
all that stuff is now yeah yeah and i

524
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,439
mean there's there's plenty of cheap too

525
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,720
but it's like the taxes i mean i saw

526
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,640
that thing where

527
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,880
you know they broke down like how much

528
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,919
an eighth is and like the farmer gets

529
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,799
three bucks and the tax man gets 21

530
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,759
bucks

531
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,759
and the dis and the and the dyspo gets

532
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,119
20 bucks and then the

533
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,359
[ __ ]

534
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,639
you know dispensary gets 40 bucks and

535
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,959
you end up paying 80 bucks yeah you know

536
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
it's it's that that is preposterous

537
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,079
there's like three layers there there's

538
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,759
the government there's the distribution

539
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,439
and there's the store

540
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,240
and they're all

541
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,759
you know pillaging because they can

542
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,798
i paid attention when i was a kid i

543
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,640
watched that movie robin hood

544
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,079
and i remember there was a sheriff of

545
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,160
nottingham

546
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,399
and i remember they would

547
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
bug people for money and i kept that

548
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
with me growing up and i was like wow

549
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,599
this tax thing is a scam isn't it like

550
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,759
to at some level

551
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,439
at some level the way it works now this

552
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,038
is uh we've all been conditioned to

553
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,720
think that this is what we need to do

554
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,200
and i agree to have society people need

555
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,440
to pitch in but i mean

556
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
what i think has happened is like

557
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,880
you know it's it's one of those things

558
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,799
where any time like any kind of vice

559
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,320
becomes more acceptable

560
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,119
they want to give money to cops in

561
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,960
schools yes obviously like they're just

562
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,558
like well you know here's funding for

563
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
various groups

564
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,558
right and so we're going to tax the [ __ ]

565
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,200
out of this vice or whatever it might be

566
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,279
right so he's the other voting half and

567
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,960
you know they they made taxes based

568
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,639
probably on like a much higher pound

569
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,840
price than people are getting

570
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,440
yeah

571
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,038
in that regard so you know so it's not

572
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,919
really so that's really what's happened

573
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,679
is like in the 215 era

574
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,200
anybody could grow whatever they wanted

575
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,559
and if they had a medical card and they

576
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,798
grew good enough leave they could walk

577
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,399
into a medical dispensary and they could

578
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,240
make a deal yeah

579
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,559
and that allowed a wide variety of

580
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,359
things to proliferate

581
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,639
i mean one of the one of the aspects of

582
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,479
the person that's getting [ __ ] talked

583
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,240
about this week

584
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,400
is that not only are people upset at

585
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,599
like the the associations that he's

586
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,480
making right

587
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,240
um but he but it you know a lot of the

588
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,400
genetics that people you know he sold

589
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,000
his genetics for high dollar and they

590
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,840
were and there was a nurse reaction and

591
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
there was a lot of disease and viroid

592
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,399
involved a lot of vibrate which we will

593
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,798
be doing a show september 8th about

594
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,798
the hop laden viroid and everything

595
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,879
you'd ever want to know inside out we're

596
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,960
going to try to cover yeah and because

597
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,200
it's it's uh it's the new

598
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
you know with all it takes is poor

599
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,798
practices

600
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,079
at a facility and especially at a

601
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,720
nursery uh and not and a lack of care

602
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,839
and spending on testing and you can nuke

603
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,880
uh you can spend so many gardens and get

604
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,639
infected

605
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,360
yeah we've had friends who have lost

606
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,919
whole collections time and time again

607
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,678
because of this virus because it's not

608
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
really your vibrate because it's not

609
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,960
easy to clean

610
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,119
and that's you know that's a that's a

611
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,480
that's a that's a product to be honest

612
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,079
of legalization

613
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,038
but without proper regulation yes

614
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,678
you know

615
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,400
um you know i mean on on a certain level

616
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,080
it's like uh you know using using razor

617
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
blades on multiple plants is sort of

618
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,720
like using tattoo needles on multiple

619
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,558
customers or junkies share needles it's

620
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,558
the same whatever whatever it's the same

621
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,480
gig it's like unless it's sterilized in

622
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,639
between or you use a fresh one for the

623
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
next like it's it's got to be kind of

624
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,280
that kind of of

625
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,440
of environment now yeah because it's

626
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,399
written it you know and so

627
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,000
there's important another reason

628
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,480
to not forget to buy seeds we should not

629
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,159
let the seed industry die

630
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
so yeah i mean that's that's another

631
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,200
thing is that

632
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
maybe what i don't know my comments have

633
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,960
totally frozen i haven't yeah

634
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
i haven't seen any new comments in a bit

635
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
so if people are typing stuff in

636
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,798
it's like for the last five minutes it's

637
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,038
just not done jack so i apologize if i'm

638
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,319
not seeing anything um

639
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,279
but

640
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,000
you know there's it used to be that

641
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,879
uh the 215 era and sort of the grain

642
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,720
market era um allowed a lot of

643
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
capitalistic activity a lot a lot of

644
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,600
small businesses a lot a lot of garage

645
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,919
size growers independent breeders

646
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,918
uh you know various types uh you know

647
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,720
pretty low bar to entry

648
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
yeah

649
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,919
you know and now that that's all getting

650
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,000
now that's all getting like you know

651
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,960
legalized or whatever else it's barring

652
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,599
entry to a lot of people yeah so

653
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
you know i i do think i do think that

654
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,158
the um

655
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,159
i do think that all the public

656
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,039
commentary this week calling out certain

657
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,159
people

658
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,599
is one of the better ways um i mean

659
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
someone asked well how do you educate

660
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,038
the public right

661
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,359
so some of it is like just like the

662
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,440
stuff that we're doing right now

663
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,439
right where we do we do a show that's

664
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,798
not like that it's not all about us or

665
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,720
whatever and we try to talk about

666
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,319
different different aspects of the weed

667
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,319
industry and different content and some

668
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,798
history and different things because

669
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,359
educating people is the best way to get

670
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,359
people on your side right and i talk

671
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,798
about matt with matt all the time about

672
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,879
this where it's like

673
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,879
um you know we really have to like build

674
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
a coalition

675
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,520
yeah it's it's going it's going to be

676
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,440
political in a way or significantly

677
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,519
yeah or a syndicate as the case may be

678
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,400
but we have to we have to build a

679
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,000
syndicate of like-minded people and they

680
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
can be pretty diverse and and the

681
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,919
important part is that we don't want to

682
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,558
eliminate a ton of people we want to

683
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,880
like have a general set of goals

684
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,960
yeah be all-inclusive and you know

685
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,559
whether whether you're politics or this

686
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
year that like you know you got to be

687
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,119
relatively accepting of people that

688
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,519
share those same basic goals yeah right

689
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,038
and so for me those basic goals are like

690
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,200
not only do i want me to be legal i

691
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,119
wanted to be easily accessible

692
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640
i wanted to be high quality

693
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,558
and i want people to be able to do what

694
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
they want with it yeah

695
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,319
you know and so i feel like and you know

696
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,400
i know that you rolled your eyes for a

697
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,720
second when i said oh we're winning

698
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
but in a sense you know because it does

699
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,279
feel like for cannabis industry people

700
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,279
it does feel like a pretty dark time

701
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,240
right there's a lot of change happening

702
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,359
fast

703
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,839
the pricing uh which used to like

704
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,479
fuel the insurgency if you will

705
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,079
yeah right right uh you know i mean

706
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,319
there's some aspects where it's like it

707
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,879
was so hard for anybody to beat the

708
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,558
taliban right because they had a bunch

709
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,799
of heroin in the hatch

710
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,038
yeah and so they were able to fund their

711
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:50,079
[ __ ] right and so when prices were

712
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,839
higher uh the insurgency in america as

713
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,199
far as like you know wheat rights or

714
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,199
whatever was was better funded yeah

715
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,880
um as the price falls apart and various

716
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,519
things a lot of people start to struggle

717
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,240
you know um but then you know the side

718
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,278
benefit is a lot more people get into it

719
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,919
yeah

720
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,159
right so like the coalition can get way

721
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,278
way way bigger than it ever was before

722
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
yeah

723
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,720
right so that's an advantage scary for

724
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,919
all of us like who depend on it solely

725
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,440
right yeah because change is scary but

726
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,520
so what it boils down to is the reason

727
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
why i said we're winning is because for

728
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,158
half my life they told me we couldn't

729
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,359
have it

730
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
and now they want to steal it from us

731
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,959
but they weren't successful in

732
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
preventing anything we wanted to do

733
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,000
before

734
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,759
yeah even though we had to battle them

735
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
for a long time to eventually get to

736
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,278
where we wanted to go yeah so i don't

737
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,038
view it

738
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,798
per i don't view it all that much

739
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,599
different than that

740
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,440
it's just like the goals and the and and

741
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,839
the idea has changed

742
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,278
yeah sure has right we're going from

743
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,240
like access

744
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,640
and and freedom and not being jailed and

745
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,200
all that to like now we get to choose

746
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,278
like well how do we want weed to look

747
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,960
how do we want it to be like

748
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,640
right and

749
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,480
oh you know so

750
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,240
there's there's an aspect of it where

751
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,159
it's like

752
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,000
i feel like people have had access to

753
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,159
most except there's a couple people on

754
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,079
here who disagree but there's uh most

755
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,880
people have access to pretty good weed

756
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,439
yeah right

757
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
shout out to dickie yeah there's some uh

758
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,038
there's some uh there's you know there's

759
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,200
some people sadly that have been exposed

760
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,038
to a bunch of jank if you will and are

761
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,440
unhappy with their access to weed but

762
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,519
lots of people's access to weed has

763
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,679
gotten much better yeah

764
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,798
clone trading is easier even if you

765
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,480
don't have

766
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,319
i mean i don't like clone sellers all

767
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,960
that much to some degree but to be

768
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,639
honest like if you it might be a lot of

769
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,440
people's only way to get at certain

770
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
things

771
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,200
yeah right so it's available and it's

772
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,120
out there and it's like it's not it's

773
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,000
not it's like you can build a collection

774
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,319
now with some money yeah if you if you

775
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,519
have finances you can at least be given

776
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,278
the illusion that you're getting

777
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,038
something with programs yeah and that's

778
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,880
and in some ways that's more that could

779
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,400
be that could be as satisfying as

780
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,400
waiting around to get into the right

781
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
groups for years and years before you

782
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,759
start getting some access to some of

783
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,439
this stuff yeah so even though it's

784
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,759
negative in some ways there's positive

785
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,798
in other ways because my whole goal with

786
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,200
weed is uh more people smoking better

787
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,960
weed yeah

788
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,640
right and you know people are talking

789
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,679
about i can barely find weed without the

790
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,840
[ __ ] cookies bottleneck right

791
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,559
and that's hard and that's okay

792
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,879
that's that's fair because really i mean

793
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,319
we we're gonna jump around i guess a

794
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
little bit if we start talking about

795
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,038
that but

796
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,119
basically that's the fight okay and so

797
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,599
instagram we like to get into a lot of

798
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,000
petty fights with one another

799
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,759
okay uh there might even be someone that

800
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,119
like you know has participated in a

801
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,960
petty fight every now and again

802
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,879
some of them are good some of them are

803
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,120
good-natured and good-hearted some of

804
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
them are a little bit more you know we

805
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,038
but we got to pick our battles because

806
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,640
it's like yeah you know you might be

807
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:07,839
battling with someone but like both of

808
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,559
you were like well i'm not i don't

809
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,678
believe in working with cops yeah

810
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,798
so we have this consensus right

811
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640
right where

812
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,798
you know we want a consensus of better

813
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,520
weed and i'll tell a story for a second

814
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,359
because there's an aspect of this that i

815
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,798
think is the truth is

816
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,439
you know when

817
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,359
um when we made alcohol illegal uh with

818
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,519
the with the whatever amendment it was

819
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,879
right yeah um

820
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,200
for a bunch of time

821
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,720
only the only the mob and everybody else

822
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,360
ran alcohol

823
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
yeah and then there was so much drinking

824
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,879
and so much lawlessness around it that

825
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,038
they basically repealed it because it

826
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,679
was better to have it legal than illegal

827
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,398
yeah they over grew over drank if you

828
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,000
were

829
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,079
they didn't i think they were seeing a

830
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,159
lot of tax dollars go out the side and

831
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,839
yeah and so yeah and so but then there's

832
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,640
an aspect right where

833
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,119
um for the next like 50 or 60 years

834
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,679
after they legalized it yeah they forced

835
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,439
him a bunch of [ __ ] beer on america

836
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,200
oh near beers

837
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,960
just you know it was like when i when i

838
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
was in when and just even in the 90s

839
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,200
when i was going to in bars in chicago

840
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,519
like the nicest beer was heineken

841
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,080
i wonder if during prohibition alcohol

842
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,639
got cheaper when it was legalized or if

843
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,918
it got more expensive but the quality i

844
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,559
guess you're i guess there was a bunch

845
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,080
of [ __ ] cheap there was one so i i guess

846
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,960
what i'm basically saying is that it

847
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,639
broke

848
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
the quality

849
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,480
it broke the relationship to quality for

850
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,559
a while right

851
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,440
decades even and everybody could choose

852
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,240
between coors or michelob or budweiser

853
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,278
or

854
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,440
old style or freaking you know keystone

855
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,599
or you know it was all cheap shitty

856
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,679
pilsners yeah right and then there was

857
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,439
this like revolution that happened which

858
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,759
was basically like people deciding well

859
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,519
what if we just brewed good beer

860
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,759
yeah right micro breweries yeah and now

861
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,519
um you know the budweiser budweiser

862
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,480
makes half the barrels it makes a

863
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,319
budweiser now that it did in the 90s

864
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
yeah half

865
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,359
and it was one of the biggest beer

866
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,919
companies in the nation

867
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,278
you know they ended up buying 15 or 18

868
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,720
micro brews

869
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,398
yeah because they want they didn't want

870
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,798
to lose their micro their their share

871
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,158
but what i mean by that is that what's

872
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,679
going to come

873
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
is people are going to try to start

874
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,840
selling really cheap really shitty weed

875
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,600
for expensive yeah and hoping that's

876
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,199
your only option and you just deal with

877
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,879
it yeah

878
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,840
and a lot of people don't know that

879
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,278
there are better options

880
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,678
and you're going to these like you know

881
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,119
legal states or whatever

882
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,278
that are that you know that maybe some

883
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,879
of them don't have the greatest history

884
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,798
um that some of the more fortunate

885
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
states do in terms of like large amounts

886
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,158
of growers and access to really good

887
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,960
weed they might have had you know

888
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,480
mexican or beasters or you know sort of

889
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,399
the low grade of what comes from the

890
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,880
better states you know shipped to their

891
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,278
state and now it's legal and so you have

892
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,200
to push for you have to push for better

893
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,640
weed yeah

894
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,679
you know because they're going to try to

895
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,559
sell you okay weed for high prices

896
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,559
yeah

897
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,599
and you have to vote with your dollars

898
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,759
on better wheat you know and then if

899
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,599
your doll if you can't find better weed

900
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,038
then grow your own and keep your dollars

901
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,639
in your pocket and spend it on something

902
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,000
else yeah

903
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,919
you know and then eventually if enough

904
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,159
people don't buy shitty weed they'll

905
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,640
have a really hard time with shitty weed

906
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,559
i just think that's such a utopian

907
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,080
way of i mean it's true this is true

908
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,000
what you're saying it is logic and it's

909
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,398
true i just think it's such a utopian

910
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,558
view to hope that that will happen

911
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,918
why so here's the thing walmart is the

912
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,440
biggest supplier and yeah okay but let's

913
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,440
let's put it this way right and there

914
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
and here's the gig there's nothing wrong

915
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
with that either because

916
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,640
there's plenty of people out there that

917
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,960
probably can't afford the quality of

918
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,720
weed that we like to smoke sure right

919
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,038
and so they might have to get lesser

920
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,640
quality wheat yeah so there's stuff like

921
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,480
that there is always going to be you

922
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,399
know an existence of the

923
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,159
the low quality or there could be some

924
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,518
people that are like i'm fine with this

925
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,360
weed and i'm going to put it in a metal

926
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,200
pipe with a screen that i never clean

927
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,038
and it gets me high and i don't care or

928
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,798
mix it with tobacco and [ __ ] yeah or

929
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,158
mix it with tobacco or whatever that and

930
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,720
that's okay too i'm not trying to be

931
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,760
some snob but what i'm saying is is that

932
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,519
like when i was when i was a kid okay

933
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,240
the only way you could get organic food

934
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,000
was like on dead tour or like crunchy or

935
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,200
organic co-ops

936
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,319
yeah

937
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,798
right

938
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,079
you know what i'm saying and

939
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,158
and now

940
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,599
um there's whole foods and there's all

941
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,519
these high-end stores and there's

942
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,079
organic food in almost every normal

943
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,079
grocery store yeah right because people

944
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,319
demanded a better grade

945
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,678
and they were willing to pay more for it

946
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,439
and now all of a sudden it's everywhere

947
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,278
when i was in the 90s you could not find

948
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,038
organic food in a normal grocery store

949
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,720
oh you know yeah yeah

950
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,319
there's just christmas stores yeah you

951
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,079
[ __ ] couldn't you had to go find some

952
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,839
hippie crunchy store maybe it existed

953
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,759
and maybe it didn't

954
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,359
you know and so

955
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,960
you know if you say oh we can't do that

956
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,479
walmart's the biggest we can't because

957
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,120
we did it with food

958
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
yeah and you know it wasn't just hippies

959
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,319
here's the thing this is what people got

960
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,759
to realize right is that hippies did not

961
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,678
make organic food a household name

962
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,079
yeah yuppies did

963
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,320
yes hippies provided the basis but

964
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,519
there's these [ __ ] yuppies right and

965
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,519

00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,599
mentioned that did that to organic food

996
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,278
when they what do you what kind of weed

997
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,359
do you think they want to buy the thing

998
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,278
is food is different than weed

999
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,319
food

1000
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,398
food one is it's necessary

1001
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,918
everybody eats food not everybody smokes

1002
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:38,798
weed everybody's eating food they're

1003
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,600
really like

1004
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,839
experience with quality not everybody

1005
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,759
has smoked weed their whole life and has

1006
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,678
experience with quality to no quality

1007
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,398
when they're getting it i mean you could

1008
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,080
see i could see yuppies buying 80

1009
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,439
cookies eights and these baggies and

1010
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,119
thinking they're getting the supreme

1011
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,880
quality and they can be

1012
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,558
they can be confused into it and i think

1013
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,760
we're going to see a lot of that because

1014
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,678
they would have to search out the

1015
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,359
education you can't force education on

1016
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,360
these people

1017
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,359
it's going to take time it will take

1018
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,319
time in in the organic food case we're

1019
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,358
talking over a 20 or 30 year period bro

1020
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,159
yeah

1021
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,918
right

1022
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,039
what's going to be left in 20 or 30

1023
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,719
years with weed and strains and

1024
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,559
all these things that we're going to

1025
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,799
lose over that 20 to 30 year period

1026
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,559
because none of the people that run

1027
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,399
these grows that are going to be able to

1028
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,078
survive and compete

1029
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,440
monetarily are going to be the ones

1030
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,159
keeping these old strains with these

1031
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,800
special qualities so you're correct and

1032
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,240
i'm not trying to be you know remember

1033
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
that we're trying trying to make the

1034
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,799
theme is like what can people do god

1035
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,960
damn it rather than like give up hope

1036
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,399
and like drink jewelry

1037
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,039
we're not trying to we're not trying to

1038
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,039
drink bleach tonight so okay yes so the

1039
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,279
aspect is is that there's going to be a

1040
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,398
ton of people out there that smoke weed

1041
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
that

1042
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,838
don't rely on weed entirely for their

1043
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,000
income yeah there are lots of people out

1044
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,279
there okay that can

1045
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,480
save a few strains in their collection

1046
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,800
as a hobbyist sure right there are there

1047
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,880
are people that can buy one or two packs

1048
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,400
from their favorite readers

1049
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,000
and that and that adds up like you know

1050
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,639
when when i'm talking about food in the

1051
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,239
90s think about like all these heirloom

1052
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,358
vegetables that just popped out of

1053
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,679
nowhere

1054
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,759
they were maintained by like a dedicated

1055
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,639
group of traders and like and

1056
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,720
enthusiasts without very much without

1057
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,039
very much money in it for a long time

1058
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,559
that's very true now the risk is is that

1059
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,480
they if their [ __ ] wasn't highly

1060
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,400
regulated and taxed and illegal like i

1061
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,838
said they could grow [ __ ] 45

1062
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,680
different kinds of tomatoes in their

1063
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,199
backyard and trade with all their

1064
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,279
friends and mail it all over the place

1065
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,199
and trade seeds and no one gave a [ __ ]

1066
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,640
yeah they haven't let us do that yet

1067
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,639
with wheat so they're making our job

1068
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,159
[ __ ] harder yes

1069
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,679
that's right they're making it harder

1070
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,159
i'm not saying it's easy it's [ __ ]

1071
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,279
hard like i have a big i have a big mom

1072
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,598
collection

1073
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,720
right it's [ __ ] expensive it sucks

1074
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,440
it's tough

1075
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,279
it's it's hard it's it's fearful and you

1076
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,039
know we're still paying electric bills

1077
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,359
from years ago

1078
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,719
oh my [ __ ] god dude so

1079
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,639
i don't even want to talk about that

1080
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,319
yeah but but there's an aspect where

1081
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,319
there's you know there's 215 people

1082
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,559
listening to us right now or whatever

1083
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,720
if each person decided there's one or

1084
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,599
two strains i love and i'm gonna try to

1085
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:25,598
make sure this one stays alive

1086
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,760
and then thousands of people start to do

1087
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,000
that then not everyone has to hold on to

1088
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
everything that's very true but if a

1089
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,880
couple people just if enough people

1090
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,960
decide to hold on to the electric

1091
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,519
boogaloo and a couple people decide to

1092
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
[ __ ] hold on to you know chem 91 and

1093
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,838
these people decide to hold on to some

1094
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,559
haze and you know i mean honestly the

1095
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:47,279
way that i don't lose [ __ ] because i do

1096
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,639
lose [ __ ] is i try to find people

1097
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
that love certain things

1098
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,480
and these four or five these four or

1099
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,880
five things

1100
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,400
yeah they grow and they love

1101
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,640
i'm not asking them to hold on to

1102
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,000
anything that they don't love yeah but

1103
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,440
they don't want to lose it either

1104
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,719
they're in love with it right they want

1105
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,358
to have you know it's one of the ways

1106
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,919
that deep that all these things survived

1107
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,799
you know and um

1108
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,480
and

1109
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,720
you know and and there's an aspect to it

1110
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,159
too where i did this for a long time and

1111
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,759
now all of a sudden a bunch of the stuff

1112
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,519
that i have is like in demand or

1113
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,680
whatever because

1114
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,039
it's old and it's like it there's not

1115
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,838
that many people that have held it that

1116
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,519
long yeah but everyone on this thing has

1117
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,440
the ability to do that to one or two

1118
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,960
things there's a constant thing like

1119
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,800
when we were throwing our little canned

1120
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,880
illuminati parties before covet [ __ ]

1121
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,280
everything up yep you know i would

1122
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,640
mostly honestly guys i would mostly grow

1123
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,079
one or two or three things for the

1124
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,358
market

1125
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,880
but then i'd have a section of the

1126
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,440
greenhouse or whatever that was just

1127
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,880
like my heads yeah it's dash and i

1128
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,358
probably brought what did i bring like

1129
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,880
probably 20 or 30 different things each

1130
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:52,799
year yeah

1131
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
i'd say that's fair if not more yeah

1132
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,280
right you know

1133
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,559
i brought we brought a bun we brought a

1134
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,560
bunch of different things for it right

1135
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,320
so then so then you know it's like

1136
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,000
trading amongst you and your friends and

1137
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
smoke some of this good weed try this

1138
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,480
out try this weird thing out right yeah

1139
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,598
there's a space for hobby

1140
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,000
so if we want if we want like we can't

1141
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,800
trust corporations we can't trust cookie

1142
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,639
we can't trust jbz we can't trust

1143
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,280
[ __ ] glass any of these people to

1144
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,598
hold to be like a genetic library no

1145
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,920
right that's fair to say it's got to be

1146
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,880
diffused and independent

1147
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,039
yes

1148
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,119
because even if those people did save it

1149
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,639
they would save it to profit often

1150
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,200
yes so it's not like they give you

1151
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,799
[ __ ] access to it so like oh how

1152
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,279
great i mean you know there was a there

1153
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,480
was a question that somebody asked about

1154
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,440
uh the impact of t tissue culture on

1155
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,320
breeder markets and collections

1156
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,639
um

1157
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,200
and uh maybe i'll maybe i'll jump into

1158
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,400
that for just a second because uh

1159
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,799
we're not going to name names here

1160
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,519
either but matt's lost his oh matt lost

1161
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,039
a chunk of stuff once trusting in that

1162
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,199
and there's an aspect where people are

1163
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,039
offering all these [ __ ] services

1164
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,039
but they're like give me all of your

1165
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,880
life's collection

1166
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,119
and let me hold on to it for you with no

1167
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
contracts and i'll tissue culture every

1168
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,000
single one of those [ __ ] oh

1169
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,240
i'll i'll

1170
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,760
i'll bring it back i'll get it healthy

1171
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,239
i'll hold it you just give me all your

1172
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,400
valuable stuff i'll hold on to it yes

1173
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,959
right and so and there's no and so for a

1174
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,960
collector like you know that works off

1175
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,400
the honor system i have high suspicion

1176
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,679
that they would just take the collection

1177
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,680
and do whatever the [ __ ] they want with

1178
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,639
it and use it in whatever way monetized

1179
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,159
it the most for themselves yeah

1180
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,679
and then just lie and say oh they got it

1181
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,598
from someone else so why we didn't use

1182
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,759
your version exactly so tc to me tc's

1183
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,800
cool if you want to do it yourself

1184
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,480
but

1185
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,160
if you want to involve some like big

1186
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,519
backed corporation

1187
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,879
you know our company that doesn't have

1188
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,800
your best interest at heart with the way

1189
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,400
the legal scene is around marijuana

1190
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,000
right now which is not very enforceable

1191
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,119
and everyone bends the rules every which

1192
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,519
way they want

1193
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,358
yeah i wouldn't say like you would trust

1194
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,039
your tc collection unless it was like

1195
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,559
your oldest homie

1196
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,239
and you had a lot of love and you really

1197
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,519
trusted him

1198
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,479
like if csi opened up a nursery and like

1199
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,559
had a

1200
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,838
you know yeah our our radio you know

1201
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,239
um there's various people that are

1202
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,599
friends of ours that we trust yeah

1203
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,000
you know but for the most part you're

1204
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,240
turning your [ __ ] over to some stranger

1205
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,400
yeah and if you don't know them for many

1206
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,318
many years it's a stranger

1207
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,240
but even if you do you're still i mean

1208
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,400
mostly yeah it's always a risk this is a

1209
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,559
valuable thing to a lot of people i mean

1210
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
i i joke about it with matt and some of

1211
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,838
my friends but like in the last five or

1212
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,358
six years every single person that

1213
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,960
screwed me over has been a long-term

1214
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,358
friend yeah

1215
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,880
as the scene has gotten tougher

1216
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,639
people are making different ethical

1217
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,000
choices about how to stay alive and how

1218
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:51,279
to keep their their lifestyle going yeah

1219
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,880
right and so for me i don't trust tc

1220
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,680
i don't trust i don't trust the

1221
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,400
collection to to being entities right

1222
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,559
now

1223
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,880
they're not established enough i don't

1224
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,480
like you know i just don't trust them it

1225
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,160
doesn't mean i might not in the future

1226
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,599
like it might develop to the point where

1227
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,759
i decided to take a risk or something

1228
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,440
like that but there's an aspect where

1229
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,480
right now it's just kind of wild wild

1230
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,240
west and like in the cannabis scene

1231
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,719
so i just think they're offering to do

1232
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,078
it because you have something of value

1233
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,838
a case in point i'm not going to name

1234
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,839
any names but

1235
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,519
with a tc situation this wasn't my

1236
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,400
experience but i was involved a little

1237
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,400
bit

1238
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,519
there are examples of people taking

1239
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,838
someone's dutted plant

1240
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,519
and to to clean them up

1241
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,199
meristem wise

1242
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,719
putting it off for six months with

1243
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,919
promises oh yeah it's going it's going

1244
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,598
good because you know a lot of us don't

1245
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,200
know how long this takes it was a new

1246
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,800
thing when this was happening

1247
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,598
and then returning

1248
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,680
a

1249
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,760
tiny tiny tiny little clone and telling

1250
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,598
them that it's tissue culture and it's

1251
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,480
still done it we've seen and this isn't

1252
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,880
even the same person we were talking

1253
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,079
about earlier there are so many examples

1254
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,880
of

1255
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,000
new technologies coming to cannabis and

1256
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,838
finding ways to take advantage of

1257
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,920
of people who have these collections and

1258
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,519
whatnot so that person that person might

1259
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,358
have paid four thousand dollars to get

1260
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,280
that thing meristem that person paid

1261
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,440
five thousand five thousand dollars to

1262
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,040
get it meristem with no with no like

1263
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,440
refund or proof

1264
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:19,279
if it it i mean if it tested positive

1265
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,039
give me my five thousand back maybe

1266
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
refund that [ __ ] but you know what i'm

1267
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,960
saying

1268
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,560
but that should be standard you

1269
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,240
shouldn't be able to charge for some

1270
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,318
process that fails

1271
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,598
yeah right that's that's you know and

1272
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,199
and so

1273
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,519
so there's an aspect where like not to

1274
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,919
get lost in the tc thing but

1275
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,639
but one of the aspects of these larger

1276
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,760
companies coming in is very soon the

1277
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,920
gelato and and and purple wave and all

1278
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,160
this cookie and overbred [ __ ] it's gonna

1279
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,318
still exist it's way too popular to like

1280
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,078
go away forever but it's going to become

1281
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,960
a segment of the market not just a

1282
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,960
market

1283
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,240
and so there's a huge interest

1284
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,000
in getting back all these old things

1285
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,519
yeah you know and there's you know for

1286
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,800
all these clone sellers and stuff like

1287
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,039
that i mean that's one of the risks of

1288
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,720
selling clones is like like you can have

1289
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,199
somebody somebody that works at one of

1290
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,719
these places this gets gets given money

1291
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,000
and it's like and all of a sudden you're

1292
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,559
just buying it

1293
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,880
yeah you know so it's like i don't mind

1294
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,318
if [ __ ] gets out there i just mind if

1295
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,599
those people if it gets out there and

1296
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,679
then all of a sudden they try to claim

1297
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,880
it as theirs and restrict others access

1298
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,279
to it yeah because in my perfect world

1299
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,519
like just to like throw a marker down i

1300
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,359
think that all weed that was bred before

1301
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,759
2018

1302
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,279
should be open source

1303
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,359
that's a fair statement

1304
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,599
and you can't [ __ ] claim [ __ ] there's

1305
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,920
nothing before 2018 that you can't

1306
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,359
patent it it ain't [ __ ] yours i don't

1307
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,000
give a [ __ ]

1308
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,199
it's it's [ __ ] it's it's open source

1309
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,280
to some degree it doesn't mean you have

1310
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,279
access to it

1311
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,000
right but you can't restrict it legally

1312
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,160
you can't sue me for having it

1313
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,199
dj shorts butthole is like this tight

1314
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,799
right now

1315
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,480
but it's f'ed up you know i mean it's

1316
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,359
like it is and the only reason i said

1317
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,358
his name is because he has a very public

1318
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,799
claim to those using blueberry and stuff

1319
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,239
and he does not like that oh he used to

1320
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,920
put it on his packs that you're not

1321
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,759
allowed to breed with it that you're not

1322
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,760
allowed to this with it that they retain

1323
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,760
control of the line or whatever the case

1324
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,200
may be and i understand that too but

1325
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,560
that's part of selling seeds is that

1326
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,000
you're putting it out there in the world

1327
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,318
and then anyone can do anything they

1328
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,760
want with it and that's the trade-off

1329
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,759
that and that's been happening since the

1330
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,839
beginning of time yeah

1331
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,280
every single famous dutch thing every

1332
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:31,519
single famous 90s strain was was bought

1333
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,440
seeds were bought and and people sold

1334
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,440
their own versions of it really fast

1335
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,358
yeah

1336
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,200
right so what's been going on from the

1337
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,598
but what i'm scared of is all of a

1338
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,879
sudden someone telling me that like

1339
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,760
oh no we we own the chem d

1340
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,640
yeah

1341
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,880
we own the 91 we own them we own this we

1342
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,239
don't you know whatever

1343
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,838
you know so it's like if you make

1344
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,519
something in the legal market if you

1345
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,119
have a legal nursery and you make your

1346
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,880
own breed and you and you do something

1347
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,240
like that to it maybe it starts to get

1348
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,079
different

1349
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,000
yeah but all the stuff that came out of

1350
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,160
the shadows all the stuff that came out

1351
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,239
of prohibition the whole genetic library

1352
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,920
of everything else it's it should be i'm

1353
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,039
not owned by anybody

1354
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,000
i agree

1355
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,318
and and you know and um and that'll that

1356
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,639
that that'll really democratize it

1357
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,358
you know case in point like i i do like

1358
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,960
having action with words and with the

1359
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,519
blue bonnet mail

1360
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,039
after i made the lines and literally

1361
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,119
immediately after i gave it to radio

1362
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,639
ridge to to have it open source for any

1363
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,160
breeder who wants to inject blueberry

1364
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,159
into their lines you know what i mean

1365
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,598
and i i try to stand behind that because

1366
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,759
i think it

1367
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,680
i really think if you're good at what

1368
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,200
you do

1369
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,879
you shouldn't tie yourself to one thing

1370
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,679
and you should be able to make new and

1371
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,760
unique and go new different directions

1372
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,960
and be inspired by stuff like that and

1373
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,400
if someone else makes something better

1374
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,280
than you you should be able to look at

1375
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,440
that admire it want to use it and better

1376
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,440
it i mean you know

1377
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,599
matt is not at all but i'm a i'm a big

1378
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,358
fan of the grateful dead right yeah and

1379
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,838
one of the reasons why

1380
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,000
they have so many shows recorded

1381
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,599
is you know and they've been they played

1382
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,039
more shows than anybody and they and

1383
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,760
there's more live recordings of them

1384
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,279
than anybody they left tapers they had i

1385
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,599
mean they made sound boards but they let

1386
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,079
tapers set up in the audience

1387
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,079
and they yeah and basically they said

1388
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,079
after we play it it's theirs

1389
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,160
that's beautiful

1390
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,760
don't bootleg our albums

1391
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,279
but our show as soon as we're done

1392
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,960
playing it we played it for you it's

1393
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,440
yours

1394
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,039
and they were pretty pork rock yes super

1395
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,720
punk rock dude they were i mean they

1396
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,759
they came from prankster

1397
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:39,759
you know from prankster ethics

1398
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,560
it was a great garage band too

1399
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,760
so

1400
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,358
you know uh yeah i mean someone just

1401
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,680
said i hear a lot of the og lines were

1402
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,598
backseat all og is backseat

1403
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,559
so let's start it started with a bag

1404
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,800
seed more bag seeds were created

1405
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,679
um it's it's it's bag seeds and bag

1406
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,079
seeds

1407
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,358
yeah it's it's accidental pollination

1408
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,318
all the way up

1409
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,799
yeah

1410
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,639
you know so so that's what i think you

1411
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,440
know there's gonna and and maybe that's

1412
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,358
what people can do people can fight to

1413
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,880
keep even if you're gonna crop one or

1414
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:11,920
two things for your little market or

1415
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
whatever

1416
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,599
save one or two other moms that you grow

1417
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,039
a plant or two of every now and again

1418
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,079
and you hold on to something that you

1419
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,000
care about

1420
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,839
yeah make it be something that you enjoy

1421
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,358
smoking

1422
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,039
you enjoy smoking it because that's what

1423
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,960
keeps you keeping it that's what keeps

1424
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,400
you keeping it you know and like and

1425
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,000
then if and then if thousands of

1426
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,519
different people hold on to one two or

1427
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,599
three or four things that they love a

1428
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,318
lot we'll have a lot more heirlooms that

1429
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,838
make it yeah because it'll be a lot more

1430
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:43,440
insulated from like you know the the the

1431
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,519
too few collectors like me you know who

1432
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,200
like there's fires there's issues

1433
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,440
there's accidents there's [ __ ] that can

1434
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,039
happen you know the more diffused it is

1435
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,079
the better the better chance we have

1436
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,199
with stuff surviving absolutely

1437
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,079
um before we continue someone did ask me

1438
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,919
um to talk about and give a kind of

1439
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,280
public service announcement during these

1440
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,599
times in cannabis and i think it's

1441
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,920
important as well a lot of us have lost

1442
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,760
a lot of people to suicide

1443
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,240
and unfortunately it's not just cannabis

1444
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,839
it's the whole economic society in

1445
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,879
america there's not a lot of empathy

1446
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:16,159
right now

1447
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,480

1451
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,639
lot of people i mean

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,760
have this i have that this has worked

1477
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,519
for me for a lot of us

1478
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,400
you know that are in our like you know

1479
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,239
mid 30s to mid 40s or whatever this has

1480
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,920
been working for us basically our whole

1481
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,719
adult life

1482
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,400
yeah

1483
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,480
yeah and now you know and now it's

1484
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,960
changing dramatically i don't do

1485
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,280
anything else good like really i like

1486
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,119
that's not even just a statement like

1487
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,040
this is what i have done most of my

1488
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,240
adult life and the stuff that i used to

1489
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,119
do

1490
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,039
that's bypassed the technology bypassed

1491
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,119
a long time ago and i think a lot of

1492
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,199
people in our community that have stuck

1493
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,838
at this for a long time that share that

1494
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:55,519
and it's it's scary the the

1495
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,920
not knowing what the future holds is

1496
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,838
scary so talk about each other there

1497
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,440
used to be this thing like with ptsd or

1498
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,759
whatever where like getting busted was

1499
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,440
like an occupational hazard right yeah

1500
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,040
and it sucked when it happens and so we

1501
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,800
used to be we used to get scared about

1502
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,079
that to some degree and now

1503
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,920
it's like you're not scared about

1504
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,440
getting busted as much as you are like

1505
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,680
just failing

1506
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,519
yeah right and so and then that and then

1507
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,919
that leads some people to like look

1508
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,280
around to like you know get

1509
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,519
sell out

1510
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,720
yeah you know i'll i'll give you guys a

1511
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,759
story of back home for a second right

1512
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:29,679
so

1513
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,520
this is this is what used to happen when

1514
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,838
we when the flood hit

1515
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,679
okay and we used to call the flood is

1516
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,799
when like the flood of outdoor really

1517
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,519
hit the market yeah right and prices

1518
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,359
dropped and not not like crazy like

1519
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,199
today but but there'd be an aspect where

1520
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,318
all of a sudden like weed would be hard

1521
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,199
to move

1522
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,279
yeah

1523
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,118
you know um and

1524
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,640
and and the issue was is it wasn't like

1525
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,240
it was hard to move it was more like

1526
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,519
there was just enough of it that like

1527
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,039
some of it was moving and a lot of it

1528
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,719
was sitting until some of more of it

1529
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,880
moved right sure

1530
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,279
and people would come up and talk to me

1531
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,400
and literally like the brokers in

1532
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,400
november or december are vampiric

1533
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,960
yeah like they're like oh you have you

1534
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,400
have fireweed and you have some savings

1535
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,559
don't you have a buddy that's like three

1536
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
months behind on the pg e christmas is

1537
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,920
coming the wife's terrified they're two

1538
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,440
months behind on their mortgage they got

1539
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,838
a bunch of fireweed and they want to

1540
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,599
make a dope deal

1541
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:25,039
yeah and a lot of times

1542
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,519
they didn't want to buy from anybody

1543
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,039
that was stable for a couple of months

1544
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,559
yeah because they wanted they wanted

1545
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,400
they wanted to take advantage of the

1546
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,920
poor planners and the people in a tight

1547
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,440
spot where they could get a more

1548
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
aggressive deal and they could make a

1549
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,639
bunch more margin

1550
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,559
yeah

1551
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,719
right i mean that was just that's just

1552
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,319
like standard that's standard business

1553
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,159
you know and a lot of times people would

1554
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,159
you know back in the day especially

1555
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,799
people would bury their stuff or not

1556
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,558
trim it till spring and you know if you

1557
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,000
had money you wouldn't sell it till

1558
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,760
february march april may yeah

1559
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,400
because that's when the flooded passed a

1560
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,079
bit and the desperation was gone and

1561
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,760
then they started coming up and looking

1562
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,119
for just good packs

1563
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,880
yeah

1564
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,559
and you know and so

1565
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,160
yeah you know there's always been sort

1566
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,920
of like that the reason why i brought

1567
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,199
that up is that

1568
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,800
right now that's kind of what's

1569
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:16,480
happening is people are looking at seed

1570
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,880
collections people are looking at clone

1571
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,119
collections people are looking around it

1572
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,800
and they're like who's desperate who's

1573
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,119
desperate what's the cheapest i can get

1574
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,519
this out of this who's failing who's in

1575
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,240
trouble who's stressed

1576
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,599
right because you know um but you're

1577
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,039
right people are saying it doesn't seem

1578
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,880
like a good way to form long-term

1579
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,239
relationships that's like you think if

1580
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,640
brokers and people like that want

1581
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,199
long-term relationships they want to win

1582
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,078
every trip to get what they want

1583
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,439
yeah

1584
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,359
that's what they're really doing there's

1585
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,920
not a bunch of the amount of people that

1586
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,719
like want to form long-lasting been

1587
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,200
mutually beneficial stable relationships

1588
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,558
that's not really weed

1589
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:55,759
you know brokers are like you know

1590
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,359
they're like they have some stable

1591
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,800
relationship with you and then they hear

1592
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,039
that like some dude is broke and is

1593
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,480
going to sell better weed for 400 less a

1594
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:03,920
pound and

1595
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,639
they're off that way

1596
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,639
yeah because that's where that dude is

1597
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:10,639
you know and so

1598
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,159
you know and and you know and and so

1599
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,719
there's a there's an aspect of that

1600
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,239
where you know people people make fun of

1601
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,358
like well you know california is all

1602
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:19,519
boof

1603
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,719
yeah and and there's an aspect of that

1604
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:22,480
where there is a lot of booth in

1605
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,159
california don't get me yes indeed

1606
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,599
there's a lot of shitty weed and there's

1607
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,118
even a lot of shitty weed in mendo and

1608
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,838
humble it's like people are trying to

1609
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,838
like brand legacy and brand that like

1610
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,639
the area that i come from it's like all

1611
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,599
just

1612
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,598
it's just all been triple a and loved on

1613
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,960
yeah that's not true either that was

1614
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,318
never true um uh it's true in some cases

1615
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,838
you know and everyone's trying to claim

1616
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,440
it right now but it certainly wasn't

1617
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,519
true for the most part people were

1618
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,400
plenty content to grow okay weed and

1619
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,880
move it

1620
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,519
yeah right so

1621
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,640
there's an aspect there where like

1622
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,519
um

1623
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,558
you know

1624
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,159
but you know i i don't know it

1625
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,400
i'm not even sure where like my train of

1626
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,318
thought was going on

1627
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,240
i'll give you something so

1628
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,639
we we were talking about solutions and i

1629
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:11,199
know like i kind of took it off in the

1630
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,279
not so solution oriented just

1631
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,879
this problem were you but

1632
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,119
one solution and you talked about it

1633
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,119
earlier was getting a bunch of people

1634
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,358
like-minded together and now with the

1635
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,240
syndicate what i originally

1636
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:26,799
what this was originally built for the

1637
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,959
big pie in the sky idea that i have for

1638
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,800
the syndicate overall

1639
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,720
first was to get everyone together

1640
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,640
that's interested in

1641
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:37,118
weed history that's truly interested in

1642
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,358
it wants to learn get together we all

1643
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,240
make each other better but from there my

1644
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,440
ultimate goal is to have it be a sort of

1645
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,358
and i know people are going to [ __ ] some

1646
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,440
people flip a union

1647
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,639
for those who came before us they don't

1648
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,159
have retirements none of us have

1649
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,358
retirements that are wheat growers like

1650
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,159
that are you know traditional um

1651
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,880
have

1652
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,639
fallbacks for that have retirement plans

1653
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,400
for these people

1654
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,239
we have to form it ourselves no one's

1655
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,559
gonna form it for us and in the only way

1656
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,318
we can do that is working together and

1657
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,240
it sucks because a lot of us won't work

1658
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,920
together but i think over time a lot of

1659
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,679
the the old school dudes the people that

1660
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,119
really care and people that used to butt

1661
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,838
heads even me and fletcher used to butt

1662
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,599
heads we don't we're we're cool because

1663
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,599
we all have that same kind of thought

1664
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,599
and goal so that that was the overall

1665
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,079
goal solution

1666
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,000
whatever i saw as my story i want to

1667
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,839
expound on that but i did gather my

1668
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,280
train of thought like 10 seconds after

1669
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,239
you started talking

1670
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,760
so

1671
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,118
the point i was trying to make is that

1672
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,720
like for all the people that are

1673
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,559
complaining about all this california

1674
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,239
booth that hits their town

1675
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,720
the only reason why that's happening is

1676
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,078
because the broker that got it here and

1677
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:43,439
brought it to there

1678
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,079
thinks that you don't have better

1679
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,960
options and he can force boof on you for

1680
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,318
a good margin for himself yeah that's

1681
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,559
why there's booth everywhere if you're

1682
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:55,039
angry at california booth don't blame

1683
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,880
california blame the dude the dudes in

1684
00:55:55,039 --> 00:56:00,239
your area that arranged for that to

1685
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,599
appear in your area yeah and there's

1686
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,000
tons

1687
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,720
of pretty good weed in california

1688
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,239
and there's some really exceptional lead

1689
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,558
and you could force your brokers to

1690
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,239
bring you that

1691
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,680
you know and then according to what like

1692
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:14,959
matt's saying too

1693
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:16,639
is

1694
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,760
matt and i battle all this all the time

1695
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,000
but like

1696
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,200
i what matt just said is basically like

1697
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,440
we need a really big tent

1698
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,960
we need whether it's a union or whatever

1699
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,559
else you know people are going to laugh

1700
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,440
at that for a second but really what we

1701
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,000
need is we need millions of people that

1702
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,679
get on board with the basic ideas that

1703
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,798
we think should cannabis should be

1704
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,480
and then to push for those ideas

1705
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,400
and then in some fashion eventually

1706
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,079
we'll probably get at least a niche of

1707
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,280
our ideas functioning the way that we

1708
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,440
want to

1709
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,119
yeah right but if but we're really good

1710
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,079
at fighting at one another uh cannabis

1711
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,838
uh used to be it's not so much anymore

1712
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,599
but cannabis used to be a great place

1713
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,599
where people with some mental illnesses

1714
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,119
that were untreated could make a decent

1715
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,440
living for themselves

1716
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,440
yes

1717
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:08,960
and so

1718
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,279
and so you know and and you could say

1719
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,280
you know and i mean i know in mendo i

1720
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,680
know like single moms that like you know

1721
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,839
just like grab grab some courage and

1722
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,358
went for it in the hills yeah and they

1723
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,759
were able to spend a lot of time with

1724
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:24,400
their kids growing weed

1725
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,599
right and making a living for themselves

1726
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,720
and there's a bunch of people that would

1727
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,559
have a hard time working a normal job

1728
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:31,759
yeah right and so so we interact with

1729
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,000
these people

1730
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,240
and then they don't [ __ ] act normal

1731
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
yeah you know and and then as time just

1732
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,919
gets tough for them too they start to

1733
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,719
freak out and they start to get [ __ ]

1734
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,400
and

1735
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,480
[ __ ] starts getting weird

1736
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,079
so you know but

1737
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,719
you know when it comes down to it too

1738
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,720
like people people with issues like they

1739
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,879
have a right to a living too

1740
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,879
yeah weed was a safe space for a lot of

1741
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,559
people despite the risks

1742
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,039
yeah it was

1743
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,920
you know and it's changing now

1744
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,639
you know

1745
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,159
uh it's it's changing and so as a result

1746
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:05,118
of that like there's a bunch of stress

1747
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,598
out there

1748
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,440
yeah um but we're really gonna have to

1749
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,240
like there's i see a ton of fighting

1750
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,960
people if people notice like i really i

1751
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,719
don't fight on instagram you know i try

1752
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,559
to be polite to people i'm trying to

1753
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,118
build consensus

1754
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,640
i want more people like yeah i might be

1755
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,480
way too polite or whatever and sometimes

1756
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,318
i have to eat [ __ ] or whatever and not

1757
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,079
take the bait and people are insulting

1758
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,759
or whatnot you know but that's

1759
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,359
at the end of the day that's their

1760
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,040
problem not mine

1761
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:34,400
yeah it's only my problem if i give a

1762
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:36,400
[ __ ] what they think

1763
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,680
that's very true which i don't because

1764
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,599
why would i care what you think when i

1765
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,118
don't even know who you are

1766
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,559
and i don't know what you do in life and

1767
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,760
i don't know what your vibe is and i

1768
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,280

1769
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,640
my good friends has an issue with me of

1770
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,480
course i'm going to listen

1771
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,920
yeah but like some stranger on the

1772
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,199
internet that's pissed off because i

1773
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,639
don't like somebody else or i don't like

1774
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,798
somebody's behavior

1775
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,199
yeah you know i mean matt you know you

1776
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,849
can go to whatever

1777
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,279
convert them however you like man

1778
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:02,880
[Laughter]

1779
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,839
whatever technique it takes whatever it

1780
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,838
is

1781
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,079
you know you do you do you uh in that

1782
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,680
regard

1783
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:13,440
[Laughter]

1784
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,558
hey i'm good at what i'm good at bro

1785
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,720
yeah you know it works you know so

1786
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,359
so there's an aspect there where

1787
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,358
um we want better we we want access to

1788
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,480
better weed we don't want it to be we

1789
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:26,078
don't want all these strains and

1790
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,480
everything else to be totally controlled

1791
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,680
by people because that will stifle

1792
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,000
innovation

1793
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,239
yeah you know hobby breeders and small

1794
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,079
rooms are where almost all of the best

1795
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,078
new strains come from

1796
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,960
yeah they're not gonna come from these

1797
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,960
[ __ ] chris compound female hunts or

1798
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,159
[ __ ] did this person or that they're

1799
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,199
just i don't think they're gonna come

1800
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,279
from there

1801
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,118
people are going to hype [ __ ] right and

1802
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,640
we both know that like you know we have

1803
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,798
friends and stuff most of those people

1804
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,558
are hype beasts anyway and they have way

1805
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,400
smaller breeders making their [ __ ] for

1806
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,079
them and doing the actual stuff

1807
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,280
that works you know we don't need to i

1808
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,119
don't want to say a bunch of names or

1809
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,960
whatever has just slipped out but the

1810
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,318
fact remains is that there's way better

1811
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,760
chance for one of you guys with a

1812
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:07,519
[ __ ] eight lighter

1813
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,920
right to come out with the next sour

1814
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,960
diesel than like one of these big legal

1815
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,159
spots

1816
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,519
yep

1817
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,358
but the only way that's going to happen

1818
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,039
is you have to grow good weed and you

1819
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,798
have to keep good weed in your room and

1820
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,679
you have to keep weed you love in your

1821
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:23,759
room

1822
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,759
the best weed comes out of weed you love

1823
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,838
right and so like people were asking

1824
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,680
earlier like how many how many how many

1825
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,239
moms i have and it varies a bunch but

1826
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:33,519
it's like my mom collection is really

1827
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:34,399
odd

1828
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,639
yeah

1829
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,160
i'm very when people ask me that i'm

1830
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:39,679
gonna be like why you want to know my

1831
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,519
plan account yeah i mean i'm not i'm not

1832
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,279
gonna that's that's i'm not i just i

1833
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,280
just meant in the sense that like you

1834
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,440
know because like some number matters or

1835
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,079
whatever but like there's an aspect

1836
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,679
where it's it's heavily based on what i

1837
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,079
personally like

1838
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:56,480
yeah whether from a breeding perspective

1839
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,720
or whether from a uh you know a smoke

1840
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,639
perspective or a combination or whatever

1841
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:01,838
so as a result there's certain things

1842
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,440
that are kind of famous that i don't

1843
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:04,880
really have a bunch of their a bunch of

1844
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,280
variations of it

1845
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,720
yeah because i don't care about it

1846
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,200
you know that's for other people to care

1847
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,358
about i like what i like it's already

1848
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,358
overwhelming enough just to try to hold

1849
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:18,078
on to what i like yeah it's really hard

1850
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,199
to hold on to [ __ ] you don't like

1851
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,240
you know

1852
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,558
it's tough

1853
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,639
yeah you know it becomes tough and so i

1854
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,440
don't expect everybody to try to like go

1855
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:30,239
go crazy and have like big collections

1856
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,838
but a lot of diversity can be saved by

1857
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,118
people just doing one two three four

1858
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,119
five things yep

1859
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,079
um do i hold anything that i'm not a fan

1860
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,599
of but as a backup for a friend yeah

1861
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,920
there's a couple of things

1862
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,920
are there some things that are untested

1863
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,519
are there some things that like if i

1864
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,920
have a close enough friend

1865
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:52,079
and they love something a ton and they

1866
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,599
want help backing it up i understand

1867
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,960
that motivation

1868
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,000
sure

1869
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,679
you know um doesn't don't deluge me with

1870
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
like favorites that you want me to hold

1871
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,279
on to please god be good but but yeah if

1872
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,798
you're a good enough friend of mine or

1873
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,920
whatever there could be something that

1874
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:07,199
because that's how that's how all this

1875
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,240
stuff survives

1876
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,598
yeah

1877
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:13,439
is uh it is is is of his friends helping

1878
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,200
friends back things up

1879
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,798
and that insulates you from like angry

1880
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:20,719
exes and accidents and fires and you

1881
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:22,960
know all the stupid [ __ ] that can

1882
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,959
[ __ ] make you lose your [ __ ]

1883
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,039
how about making s-ones if you can't

1884
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,920
hold cut it's a great idea

1885
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:33,280
um it is advanced breeding so if you're

1886
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:36,079
new to making crosses if you're new to

1887
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:38,640
identifying males identifying females if

1888
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,119
you're not familiar with an intersex

1889
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,519
plant and even when you're using uh

1890
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,318
sprays like that like my reversal spring

1891
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,559
for example you can find it

1892
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,639
rightseats.com you can go and get that

1893
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,960
and when you spray it it doesn't

1894
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:53,598
necessarily look like a male it looks

1895
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,440
like a female expressing his mail so if

1896
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,599
you're not familiar with seeing that i

1897
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,519
recommend doing your research digging up

1898
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,039
you can always go to our patreon join

1899
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:02,798
the crew

1900
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,079
we're always talking about stuff like

1901
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,318
this we're going to have a private

1902
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,480
conversation in a in a few days on

1903
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,000
reversals and reversal techniques for

1904
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,358
small groups so they can get really good

1905
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,280
questions in

1906
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,880
but yeah i mean s-ones are a great way

1907
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,720
to back up seeds but understand that

1908
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,480
just because you're reversing it or s

1909
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,759
wanting it or selling it you're not

1910
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,000
going to have an exact clone

1911
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,680
representation of the mom so do

1912
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,920
understand that but it's an excellent

1913
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,598
way to back up the pure version of those

1914
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,240
genetics

1915
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,440
um people are asking a bunch of stuff

1916
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:35,598
that that that is um

1917
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,480
that yes all those things that you said

1918
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,079
are good

1919
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,318
um we are going to be having some like

1920
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,760
more more concentrated talks with people

1921
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,159
which is nice

1922
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,000
um people are asking about super skunk

1923
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,838
stuff like that i don't know i mean i

1924
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,318
i'm not one to like shout from the

1925
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,719
rooftops you know or anything like that

1926
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:55,279
um there i do think there's hope that

1927
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,038
that uh some of these old things exist

1928
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,559
um but i think they should be like grown

1929
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,359
out and tested and

1930
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,519
and sorted out on that level first

1931
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,119
um i think uh you know a lot of times

1932
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,639
when people get like cuts or whatever

1933
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,440
and they're convinced that it's some 30

1934
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:10,318
year old thing and they flex it

1935
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,720
you know

1936
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,798
i mean grow it out yeah see what's

1937
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,959
that's important it's important and not

1938
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:18,480
just to grow it out and it's cool like

1939
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,240
if you grow it out and you're like damn

1940
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,920
this is dank that must be [ __ ] that must

1941
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,279
be it but that's not necessarily the

1942
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,119
case just because the stink doesn't mean

1943
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,240
it's legitimately what you think it is

1944
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,480
so if you're going to grow it out and

1945
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,479
you're going to assess provenance and if

1946
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,639
it's real make sure you know

1947
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,639
about it have anything knowledge about

1948
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,480
it and don't just assume because it's

1949
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:40,159
dank that it's legit

1950
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,920
yeah and you know and and so there's

1951
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,358
someone asked what's the closest thing

1952
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,960
to super skunk and seed diesel

1953
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:49,920
diesel piercing

1954
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,039
diesel or diesel yeah these diesel

1955
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,000
diesel

1956
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,680
diesels

1957
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,280
diesels and diesels

1958
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,199
i've said a bunch of times before i kind

1959
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,280
of consider the diesel family to be like

1960
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:01,038
a modern skunk

1961
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,880
you know it's not exactly super skunk

1962
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,359
diesel is much closer to modern super

1963
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,480
skunk to like an actual pure super skunk

1964
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:10,159
but in terms of like a very skunky

1965
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,838
like and i don't mean like necessarily

1966
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,838
in terps but i'm just in terms of like

1967
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,318
the way it forms and the way it grows

1968
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:19,279
and a lot of the factors to that like i

1969
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:21,358
think sours sours and diesels

1970
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,920
have various ranges of that

1971
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,838
yeah you know um and so there's plenty

1972
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,599
luckily that there's a plethora it seems

1973
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,880
like of sour cuts right now about

1974
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,160
[ __ ]

1975
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,079
i don't know

1976
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:35,440
three dozen or something like that at

1977
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,200
all that's it they all tie back to 1995

1978
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,519
so it's really amazing that like out of

1979
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,118
nowhere like 36 different individual

1980
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:44,239
cuts that are all the real deal have

1981
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,240
popped up in two years

1982
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,119
um

1983
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,640
but uh yeah you know so i mean when

1984
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,400
people talk about super skunk too

1985
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,118
there's plenty of super skunk in modern

1986
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,720
weed and like matt said diesel is almost

1987
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,880
a pure super skunk

1988
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,358
people are a great example what what

1989
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,838
people are are you know really saying is

1990
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:06,000
that like super skunk phenos that like

1991
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,078
have rank skunk

1992
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,599
tur like aromas

1993
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,079
that's the missing link but there's

1994
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,798
plenty of like like ex physical

1995
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,480
expressions of super skunk yeah

1996
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,000
you know in the way the flower forms and

1997
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,079
the way the leaves are in the way you

1998
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
know various aspects of the traits of it

1999
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,559
it's it's in a lot of stuff

2000
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,079
yes you know so

2001
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,160
um and you know there's a thing too

2002
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,720
people are asking what's we like

2003
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:32,798
i'm not i'm you know i'm not trying to

2004
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:34,879
knock anybody's stuff but i can say that

2005
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,038
like when i started collecting sour

2006
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,280
diesels to compare to my sour diesel cut

2007
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,880
that i had to figure out what name i

2008
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,400
should attach to the one that i've held

2009
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,358
for a long time

2010
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,798
um

2011
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,038
probably in the that was like what was

2012
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:49,199
that like five or six years ago matt

2013
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,200
yep at this point

2014
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,598
there's probably like half a dozen or

2015
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,759
eight six or eight new names that i knew

2016
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,880
that were never in the forums yeah did

2017
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,640
you ever hear about albany sour diesel

2018
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,280
did you ever hear about weasel's sour

2019
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,199
diesel cut on the forums

2020
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,880
did you ever hear about like the the you

2021
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:08,318
know i mean so they're and i'm not i'm

2022
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,599
not knocking these things i didn't

2023
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:13,838
remember the cop diesel yeah

2024
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,119
so i'm just i'm just saying that like

2025
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,920
there's new

2026
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,440
like nicknames added to showers

2027
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,760
probably half a dozen or more just

2028
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,400
within the last three or four years that

2029
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,440
10 years ago you never heard about

2030
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,119
yeah

2031
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,880
right and so what does that you know are

2032
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,798
they the same as other things are they

2033
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,519
the choco are they the amish are they

2034
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,119
the

2035
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,199
this or the who knows

2036
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,039
i think every time you see someone

2037
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,279
release a seed line that's hyped and

2038
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,039
named after a cut in the form like the

2039
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,640
sour diesel we saw several different

2040
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,039
breeders release their versions of sour

2041
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:48,719
diesel i think that's when you see a lot

2042
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:50,480
of old cuts pop up and stuff people's

2043
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,798
poppings and selections of brand new

2044
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,358
lines that they think is legit enough to

2045
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,440
pass for the old i mean luckily for

2046
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:59,440
people most diesel cuts are pretty damn

2047
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,039
nice yes

2048
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,039
they smoke good they get you nice and

2049
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,559
high suck it growing and then it'll be

2050
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,240
boost

2051
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,920
because i've sucked at growing diesels

2052
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,318
before and it's been fun your boobs

2053
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,358
diesels can be finicky and they can be

2054
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:13,119
punishing

2055
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:15,199
and they can not be that great but

2056
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,119
that's i mean there's so there's

2057
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,198
um so there's an aspect where there's i

2058
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:21,599
mean maybe i exaggerated with 36 cuts

2059
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,719
but there's probably at least 15

2060
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,838
18

2061
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:28,480
named cuts a lot of which claimed to be

2062
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:30,158
close to original uh i love pot asked

2063
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,439
what names are legit

2064
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,198
that's the thing names aren't

2065
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,519
necessarily legit it's the cuts that are

2066
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:37,599
legit anybody can call anybody cut

2067
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,679
anybody's cut any name so just because

2068
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
someone calls something the charcoal cut

2069
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,359
doesn't necessarily mean that it's legit

2070
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,599
because they called it the chocolate

2071
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,640
it's kind of like how we called we

2072
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,000
called it the dog and until our buddy

2073
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,560
got online

2074
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,319
and you know and then it got named after

2075
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,359
his online handle

2076
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,199
yeah

2077
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,600
because he was the person passing it out

2078
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,960
and you know who you know the amish was

2079
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,880
passed out by washroomy right yeah

2080
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,039
you know and the child and like so

2081
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,039
things got named on the internet

2082
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:11,359
choco i called the choco because he had

2083
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,960
some of my favorite pictures of it and

2084
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,199
they were some of the best pictures for

2085
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:18,158
showing people to describe which cut i

2086
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:20,000
had so it was called ecsd but i said

2087
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,079
it's the one that choco shows chocolate

2088
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,560
and it just eventually that's how that

2089
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,640
name formed the choco cut what's that

2090
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,920
yeah and and you know and then there's

2091
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,239
you know there's

2092
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,719
you know east coast sour diesel new york

2093
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,039
sour diesel you know all these

2094
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,198
um so there was like a first wave in the

2095
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:39,600
beginning it was just called sour

2096
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:41,919
yeah it wasn't really until the forums

2097
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,000
and like the mid-2000s that names

2098
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,920
started getting applied to sour diesel

2099
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,520
yeah and then there was a batch of names

2100
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,679
and now there's a new batch of names

2101
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,480
what what really really is happening is

2102
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,719
that most people have not held their

2103
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,399
sour diesel cut consistently throughout

2104
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,800
the eras

2105
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,479
so you're trying to figure out what name

2106
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,239
is the one that ties back to what you

2107
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,479
want but it's really hard when you lose

2108
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,158
chain of command when you lose chain of

2109
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,079
who has what when

2110
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,599
yeah matt and i talk about provenance or

2111
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,079
whatever right so

2112
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:16,159
here's the provenance of my sour cut i

2113
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:19,840
got it 22 years ago and i never lost it

2114
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:21,759
do i know what it is before i got it no

2115
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,760
you know do i know how what where it

2116
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,119
went and how it went between you know

2117
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,119
the mid 90s and when i got it in 2000 no

2118
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,279
but i haven't lost it

2119
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,039
and eventually if you don't lose things

2120
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,279
like you know that if you hold on to

2121
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:37,198
things for a long time then it sort of

2122
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:40,639
becomes like that's part of the reason

2123
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:43,039
why i never tried to use other sours

2124
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,800
i had sour diesel

2125
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:46,079
why did i get a different one i had the

2126
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,920
one i didn't know there were i didn't

2127
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,439
even know there was a bunch i got sour

2128
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,319
diesel i was happy with it it was great

2129
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,039
wheat

2130
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:54,079
so why would i go trade someone for it

2131
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:55,039
yeah

2132
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:56,238
you know

2133
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,359
um and people are like what's the

2134
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:01,519
difference between the two nycd and ecsd

2135
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:03,679
cuts i think he's probably referring to

2136
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,120
nycd from soma i don't think most people

2137
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,399
know about the other one uh yeah

2138
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:07,439
someone's talking about the milli i

2139
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,439
don't know if mine's the million that

2140
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,519
dude that has the million he got he got

2141
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:13,519
his the same year i got mine in the same

2142
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,920
place i got mine which was the bay area

2143
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,159
of california but we've never exchanged

2144
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,000
cuts or grown side by side to test i

2145
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:22,079
couldn't tell you but some people would

2146
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,640
use that as enough info to say yes in

2147
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,719
fact that is the same cut yeah i mean

2148
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,400
and you know and so you know he calls it

2149
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,000
the the milly because it's short for

2150
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:32,158
millennium because he got it at the turn

2151
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,560
of the millennium yeah

2152
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:36,399
you know um but with diesels i don't

2153
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,920
really think it's it's a fair comparison

2154
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:40,158
unless you grow them in the same room at

2155
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,520
the same time same greenhouse same

2156
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:43,359
outdoor

2157
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,040
treat it the same feed it the same and

2158
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,479
then you'll see differences if there are

2159
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:47,519
and if it's the same cut it'll be the

2160
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:49,678
same cut

2161
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,480
yeah but i can't i can't compare

2162
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:54,800
somebody's led living soil grow and at

2163
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,639
different conditions to somebody else's

2164
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,679
and if they just come out too different

2165
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,760
yeah

2166
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,359
in in my you know and sometimes with the

2167
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,679
same person they come out different crop

2168
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,839
to crop

2169
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:08,239
new york city diesel isn't dutch booth

2170
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,880
it is weird and shitty in the sense that

2171
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,799
soma took the diesel name and was one of

2172
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,560
the first people to offer seeds and it

2173
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,520
was some euro

2174
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:20,080
fruity thing crossed to possibly a sour

2175
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:23,679
bag seed if you want to believe in

2176
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,920
hybrid it's grapefruit

2177
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,760
but um people have found some nice

2178
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,719
phenos on it it's nothing like sour

2179
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,880
diesel

2180
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,920
yeah the good ones aren't like sour

2181
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
diesel

2182
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,199
so

2183
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,440
uh someone's asking about master kush my

2184
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:39,279
boy bitter's got a killer version of uh

2185
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,399
master kush which is the socal master

2186
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:43,439
kush cross to the hogs breath and he's

2187
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,879
just

2188
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,678
running through those it's an old scene

2189
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,760
line um but yeah i'm stoked to see it

2190
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,920
back i'm stoked to see some uh soak out

2191
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,679
master back in the forum i'm not gonna i

2192
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,279
can't really i'm not gonna engage a ton

2193
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,480
on like what all the different names are

2194
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:58,960
because one of the things that i found

2195
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:01,039
with sour names is like they get applied

2196
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,239
to a variety of different cuts at

2197
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:07,198
different times um and it's it's really

2198
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:08,479
difficult uh to try to figure out uh

2199
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,678
sour diesel

2200
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:13,359
yeah you know um so i don't i don't know

2201
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,039
how i don't know how like i don't know

2202
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,639
how to go back on that one or whatever

2203
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:18,560
and even the headband and a lot of these

2204
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,159
things that i've held for a long time

2205
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,280
there's still more mystery than i would

2206
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:22,399
like

2207
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:23,840
sure

2208
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,599
i'm just willing to say that there's

2209
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,719
mystery to it rather than like craft

2210
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,719
some story of certainty when that exists

2211
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,719
yeah stories sound so much better when

2212
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,880
they're full of intrigue and mystery but

2213
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,719
yeah that's just how it goes

2214
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,000
you know and so i mean i've had people

2215
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,840
tell me like people someone just said

2216
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,920
the albany cuts totally legit i know

2217
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,000
someone that's had it since 99.

2218
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,920
people have told me people have told me

2219
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,960
my some of my weed is spread out a

2220
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,880
little bit and some people have been

2221
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,480
trying it and liking it some people have

2222
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,480
told me that they think that the cut

2223
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:54,799
that i have is the albany for whatever

2224
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,718
that's worth but i mean i i haven't

2225
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,920
gotten it i don't have any confirmation

2226
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,279
of it i

2227
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,199
you know i think a lot of people are

2228
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,000
throwing a lot of different names at the

2229
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:03,599
wall

2230
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,640
and trying to figure out which is cool

2231
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,600
because

2232
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,719
um

2233
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,640
you know at least there's a bunch of

2234
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,319
interest in it sour diesel is way better

2235
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,560
weed than a lot of the weed that's being

2236
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,559
traded right now a lot of the hype boy

2237
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,840
weed so it should have a moment in the

2238
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,719
sun

2239
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,480
yeah

2240
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,079
you know um somebody who said there's a

2241
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,238
master there's two like the only thing

2242
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,519
i'll say about master kush is that

2243
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:25,919
it seems like there was a there's a

2244
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,520
socal master kush that seems

2245
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,239
cushy but it's kind of a bubba-ish

2246
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,400
hybrid in my opinion um and then there's

2247
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:35,599
a there was a master kush that we had up

2248
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:37,039
north that was much leggier darker

2249
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,800
thinner

2250
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,479
type of thing and it wasn't all that

2251
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,279
frosty but it might have like my

2252
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,839
favorite math kush flavor

2253
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:48,800
i saw a lot of master kush grown on the

2254
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,039
forums from nirvana that was the

2255
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,760
majority of master kush i'd seen and it

2256
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:56,880
was a lot of like big short swat

2257
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,960
baseball bat not just fat [ __ ]

2258
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,039
short squad afghanis and there was a lot

2259
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,279
of that in the in the

2260
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:05,600
mid to late 2000s from

2261
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:07,359
nirvana being grown i remember that i

2262
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,520
had uh someone just said that's the one

2263
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,679
not so i i had that cut for probably 10

2264
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,239
years i lost it when i got some troubles

2265
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,960
i got it back but it was super dutted

2266
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:17,759
and barely drank and and you know it's

2267
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,840
uh

2268
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,840
um so we lost it again but

2269
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,520
um i hope that i have it there's a

2270
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,520
chance it still floats around oregon

2271
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,040
somewhere i have some friends that gave

2272
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,840
it out and i'm hoping that like it'll

2273
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:31,198
pop up one day uh it's really flavorful

2274
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,880
some people didn't like it as much as

2275
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:36,158
far as brokers because it was a little

2276
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:39,359
darker and wasn't as as poppy in the bag

2277
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:41,279
as certain other ogs but man had a great

2278
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,359
high and it tasted good

2279
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:45,439
but most people seem to have the socal

2280
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,479
master that some that that's also really

2281
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,039
nice

2282
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,879
but it's nice so it's a bubba yeah it's

2283
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:52,319
very very nice i like it a lot i'm not

2284
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,319
trying to dis it at all it's just not

2285
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:57,359
the one that i was familiar with and it

2286
01:15:54,319 --> 01:16:00,079
seems very bubba based it is very bubba

2287
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:02,960
based it it is it is a dead ringer for

2288
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:03,760
bubba yeah it's it's it's bubba with

2289
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,520
some

2290
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,560
i don't think it has coffee terps like

2291
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,320
bubba

2292
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,960
it can depending on how you grow it

2293
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,880
really yeah it's a lot of soapy a lot of

2294
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,399
earthy but it can hit coffee it just

2295
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,880
depends how you grow it

2296
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,319
well this is the the iron og cut is

2297
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,960
around various collectors and people

2298
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:20,960
have it i

2299
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,319
yes

2300
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,600
that's the one that still exists that's

2301
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:32,639
the one that still exists and you know

2302
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,199
the the bubba the original bubba is lost

2303
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,800
as far as i know what survives is the

2304
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:39,279
bubba kush

2305
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,199
yes which was which is a which we

2306
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:43,439
believe is a hybrid of the original

2307
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:44,719
bubba and the first kush cut that came

2308
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:45,919
to l.a

2309
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,760
yeah

2310
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,520
a seed found in that i don't think the

2311
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,360
origin no one no one's told me that the

2312
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,520
original bubba even exists it was a it

2313
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:57,359
was it was a funny looking thing

2314
01:16:53,520 --> 01:17:00,560
yeah um which is a shame you know

2315
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:02,960
uh because uh you know like i said um

2316
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,560
preservation is hard and a lot of people

2317
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,800
get rid of a lot of things thinking it's

2318
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,840
going to be easier to get it back

2319
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:12,800
and then they realize they can't find it

2320
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,400
someone's asking it's if hl the hopslate

2321
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,079
and viroid is something that's always

2322
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:20,799
been in cannabis and the answer to that

2323
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:22,640
we'll cover that on on september 8th

2324
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,279
with uh to me

2325
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,600
um to me is the the company that we're

2326
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:28,559
going to be bringing on but the short

2327
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,760
answer is

2328
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,800
no it we know exactly when it came and

2329
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,039
hit cannabis and who did it

2330
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,679
somebody uh just asked if i met the guy

2331
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:42,000
that gave me the mendo perps would i

2332
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:44,480
would i grow them like i did back then

2333
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
enthusiastically and would you trust him

2334
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:47,198
um

2335
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,679
whoa so

2336
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:51,839
that's interesting uh

2337
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,880
back then i grew water culture total

2338
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,719
hydro

2339
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,159
uh so it's very unlikely that i would

2340
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,760
grow them back then

2341
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,920
uh like like

2342
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,640
like now i have a little bit different

2343
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,000
methods now um but uh

2344
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,520
sure i would grow them just as

2345
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,119
enthusiastically

2346
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,120
um

2347
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:10,880
there's no doubt that there's a lot more

2348
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:14,559
lying going on

2349
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:18,239
about ancient strains uh now than there

2350
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,039
ever was in 1998. in 1998 nobody gave a

2351
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:22,238
[ __ ]

2352
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:24,640
uh there wasn't a fam unity to impress

2353
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:27,119
on any level you know and so there was

2354
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,800
less lying uh and even then

2355
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,238
um he didn't tell me very much at all

2356
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,840
about it the only reason why i have a

2357
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,959
tendency to believe

2358
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,039
um that uh it could be as old as he

2359
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,000
thinks it is or he thought it was is

2360
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:40,000
because

2361
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,158
it's low thc

2362
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,560
it's got a crazy wide amount of

2363
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:46,559
diversity in its genes

2364
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,880
you know uh and it doesn't seem like

2365
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,159
it's related to anything else we know

2366
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,480
yeah

2367
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,799
you know so sometimes the plant backs up

2368
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,879
the story better than

2369
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,679
but there's a there's an unbelievable

2370
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,760
amount of [ __ ] right now with

2371
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,520
ancient seeds and ancient cuts and

2372
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,280
random [ __ ] and it's

2373
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,880
um there's a renewed interest in old

2374
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:10,079
things which is wonderful

2375
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,440
um but that's led to an enormous amount

2376
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,719
of scamming

2377
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:14,238
that's enormous

2378
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:17,198
an enormous amount and i just don't

2379
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:18,959
think that in 98 99 2000 2001 there was

2380
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,639
no extra money and nobody cared so i

2381
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,800
don't think there was nearly as

2382
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,039
a reason to lie

2383
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,640
it just bothers me too because and i'm

2384
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:28,238
not gonna say any names but people are

2385
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,920
selling

2386
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:30,718
people

2387
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,039
in

2388
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,600
maybe it's a big word but dreams it's

2389
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,800
like things that you haven't had that

2390
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,280
you

2391
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,960
can't quite verify

2392
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,519
but you want and you're willing to spend

2393
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,239
good money on and that's when they sell

2394
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,840
you

2395
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,519
that's how they sell

2396
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,719
that's how they work

2397
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,560
yeah

2398
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,800
um he asked because we're talking about

2399
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,520
swapping genetics and trusting people

2400
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,119
trusting people these days is hard

2401
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,679
you know um

2402
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,000
yeah and and there's not it's it's not

2403
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:04,560
as easy i mean a lot of times you know

2404
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,960
you have to grow things out and then

2405
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,679
share that share pics and share this and

2406
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,920
that and try to make your best judgments

2407
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,520
our buddy csi grows out old seeds from

2408
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,000
people all the time

2409
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,000
yeah and just kind of lets it lets it

2410
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,800
lets the plants show him what it shows

2411
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,840
them

2412
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,600
yes

2413
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,520
right and then and then he starts to

2414
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,600
believe or disbelieve

2415
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,639
um someone's asking about tennessee stud

2416
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,520
that's a

2417
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:32,159
it was the g13 nl2 from neville

2418
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,639
cross to blue it

2419
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:39,359
and pips we did the selection for the

2420
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:41,920
keeper that we used in the g13 nlc seats

2421
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:45,039
we have to say names eventually i've

2422
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,800
said names for so many years and frankly

2423
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:48,479
it hasn't made much of a difference um

2424
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,840
if you if you're interested in names if

2425
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,198
you're interested in wanting to get it

2426
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,800
right if you're interested in all this

2427
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,439
stuff

2428
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,199
the discord that's just where it is like

2429
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,839
if you if you're really interested in

2430
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:02,158
that kind that detailed kind of info

2431
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,639
join the patreon discord you'll get

2432
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,238
plenty of info and then some and then

2433
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,159
part of the reason why

2434
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:09,678
um part of the reason why we have that

2435
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:11,920
kind of approach and we're hesitant to

2436
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:14,239
mention some of the names on the chats

2437
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,239
is because like we'll be talking about

2438
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:18,399
some wider subject and matter i or

2439
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:20,718
somebody will make a offhand comment

2440
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:23,279
about someone specific and then 10

2441
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,760
people will send like a 15 second audio

2442
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:27,039
message of just that to that person and

2443
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,440
then they're all butthurt or their

2444
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:32,079
whatever it's taken out of context or

2445
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:34,719
they're doxing me or whatever yeah yeah

2446
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:37,439
and so and and so there's an aspect of

2447
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,760
there's an aspect of uh you know

2448
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,759
of wanting to keep it a little bit more

2449
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,520
like highbrow and wanting to keep it

2450
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,239
focused on the subject

2451
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,920
and not just uh and and you know not

2452
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,238
using somebody as an example and then

2453
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,319
they feel unfairly singled out

2454
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:54,399
yeah in certain rare cases when i think

2455
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:56,479
it's like crazy enough behavior

2456
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,479
um i mean i'll we'll just say it but the

2457
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,079
point to these talks is to like educate

2458
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:02,000
people and stuff like that not so much

2459
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,279
to just sit there and like vent a bunch

2460
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,960
of grievances

2461
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:06,880
yeah that's easy to do to sit there and

2462
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:10,399
bend a bunch of grievances and it's

2463
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:12,719
really easy to sit there and talk about

2464
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:14,559
things that will make you money

2465
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,119
but it's not super easy to talk about

2466
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,760
history so somebody just yeah somebody

2467
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:23,279
just asked if g13 and nl2 is still

2468
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:26,079
available and no no no um i gave the

2469
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:30,000
rest of those seeds to a seed bank

2470
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:33,279
and they passed them out and didn't put

2471
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,880
they mixed up packages named them abcd

2472
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,399
so they just got spread throughout i

2473
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,199
don't know which is which some people

2474
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:42,158
have them and may not even know it um it

2475
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:43,919
is labeled by a letter um and usually

2476
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,599
what happens is when people grow those

2477
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,039
out and i can see them i can usually

2478
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,880
tell what it is because they were all so

2479
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,679
different you know and there's an aspect

2480
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,000
too of one of one of the reasons why uh

2481
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,000
um

2482
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,079
one of the reasons why i asked people to

2483
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,319
save stuff right

2484
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,238
is and hold on to these things is

2485
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,319
because every five or ten years cannabis

2486
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,000
really does realize

2487
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,359
yeah and things that you think are

2488
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,439
common and they aren't going to be

2489
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:10,479
around for a long time in many cases

2490
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:12,319
they don't

2491
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:14,559
yeah and the only way you can be

2492
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,920
absolutely sure to preserve it if you or

2493
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,880
your friends

2494
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,158
um

2495
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,600
you know uh

2496
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:21,439
if you or your friends help make sure

2497
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,719
you stave it you know

2498
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:24,158
and uh

2499
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:25,679
real quick uh

2500
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,039
i was talking with csi a lot of people

2501
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,359
have been asking if we were going to

2502
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:32,800
continue the northern lights project um

2503
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:34,799
with the nl1 nl2 the nl 2x5 that was

2504
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,600
sent by seattle greg and there's a few

2505
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,960
others

2506
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,360
we had been debating it because there

2507
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,679
was a lot of um

2508
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,279
politics when we were

2509
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,760
talking about selling the seeds we were

2510
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,920
selling the seeds a lot of backs back

2511
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,920
talk and weird stuff going on behind the

2512
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,760
scenes so we really had a serious sit

2513
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,359
and think is it even worth it we're

2514
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,159
gonna do it we're gonna go ahead and do

2515
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:55,920
it

2516
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,960
so that's the announcement right now if

2517
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,880
anybody

2518
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,359
is interested we are gonna do that but

2519
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,719
again just like the five just like the

2520
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:04,479
hawaiian lights

2521
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,000
we're gonna do it proper we're gonna

2522
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:07,839
take our time with it

2523
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,800
um anything that's worthwhile is gonna

2524
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,319
take time and i should say on that level

2525
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,719
that one of the things i really like

2526
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,158
about the way csi does and

2527
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,439
you know this project that him and matt

2528
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:18,960
have been doing is you know they grow

2529
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,198

2531
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:26,158
you know and i'll i i i'll do them a

2532
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:30,079
little bit later this fall but

2533
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:32,399

2536
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,560
couple of his favorites that he wants me

2537
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:40,158

2538

and the number eight is the one that

2539
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,079

2540
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,960
which is the super super stinky skunky

2541

i think i got that that one and i got

2543
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:53,198
one other one that i think you thought

2544
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:55,199
was very bubble gummy and

2545
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,960
yeah yeah um so i got i got two

2546
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,039

2547
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,439
bunch and wanted some close friends like

and uh you know yeah people are asking i

2557
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:22,238
don't know what i'm gonna have seeds man

2558
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,360
uh you know it's when he has them when i

2559
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:25,039
have them at some point you'll hear

2560
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:27,039
about it if you keep painting you know

2561
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:30,000
there are some there are some i did give

2562
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:31,600
uh csi a few things of mine a few a few

2563
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,198
select cuts that he's obviously like

2564
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,520
released a few things and i think he has

2565
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:38,238
a few more things in the pipeline oh i

2566
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:41,120
know about a not so not so la cushcross

2567
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:42,638
that just happened too oh i you know i

2568
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,639
haven't talked to homie in a couple of

2569
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,600
weeks so i'm behind him and i have been

2570
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,679
meaning to

2571
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,000
i don't know if you wanna but he i think

2572
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,399
what's happening too is that like he's

2573
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,719
kind of a pain in the ass to get excited

2574
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,079
about certain things and so you can be

2575
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,279
like oh you want to do this you want to

2576
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:59,279
do this and you'll be like yeah yeah

2577
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:00,960
whatever and then all of a sudden you'll

2578
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,639
be like oh i want to do that thing and

2579
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,639
then i'll and then it'll start happening

2580
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,480
so he has moods

2581
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,239
um and i think northern lights took a

2582
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:09,439
while to get pushed like that because he

2583
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:11,519
doesn't like

2584
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,799
stuff typically associated with dutch

2585
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,560
stuff stuff that's going to smell like

2586
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,800
old dutch stuff

2587
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,239
he's got his prejudices but he also lets

2588
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,480
the plants talk to him and he's willing

2589
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,319
to be surprised and i think now that

2590
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:23,919
he's used the la in a couple of things

2591
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:26,238
and he's gotten some really positive

2592
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,639
responses from lots of people

2593
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:30,319
it's made him more interested in seeing

2594
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,520
what else it can do

2595
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:32,399
yeah

2596
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,440
so

2597
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:35,679
um

2598
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:37,759
you know i don't think

2599
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:40,079
shanti baba would be one of the most

2600
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:42,639
unusual people to collab with he's not

2601
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:45,119
much of a collaborate with anyone like

2602
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:48,159
that i don't know if he's ever done a

2603
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:51,439
collab with anyone in america so

2604
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:52,638
that would be pretty far-fetched

2605
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,119
yeah

2606
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,840
that would be pretty far-fetched

2607
01:26:55,119 --> 01:27:00,399
um you know so uh

2608
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,400
yeah but they um i mean so you know as

2609
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:03,759
always we try to keep it like

2610
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:05,039
light and we try to go in different

2611
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,000
directions

2612
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:09,119
you know uh on that aspect but

2613
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,600
um

2614
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:13,679
you know we'll see there's a lot of uh

2615
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,600
there's a lot of interest in old seeds

2616
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,760
right now and old lines

2617
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:20,480
and if a bunch of people could get 90

2618
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,000
scentsy work or 90s serious work or this

2619
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,799
or that they would

2620
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,679
jump all over it and so

2621
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:30,000
you know um you know hopefully some of

2622
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,800
that stuff survived and hopefully

2623
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,039
amongst the wave of [ __ ] uh there's

2624
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,199
actually a few real gems

2625
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,198
that come to the surface as well

2626
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,839
you know i think a lot of people

2627
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:44,158
really really missed the [ __ ] out when

2628
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:47,520
uh pip swede offered silver pearl like

2629
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:50,238
people who are into old dank unique

2630
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,920
legit [ __ ] when pete tips we've released

2631
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,279
that silver pearl we talked about it a

2632
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,480
lot because it was one of my favorite it

2633
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:55,359
still is one of my favorite things to

2634
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:57,839
smoke

2635
01:27:55,359 --> 01:28:00,079
but there are times when people do drop

2636
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,600
these old gems that they've kept forever

2637
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,279
and people just for one reason or

2638
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,199
another miss out so make sure you guys

2639
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:07,599
are keeping your eyes peeled

2640
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:10,000
i think pip was just like two years too

2641
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,719
early i agree like if he was if he

2642
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,800
dropped it last year like in 2021 or

2643
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,639
something like that and he had some

2644
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,600
because the crazy thing about pip silver

2645
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,159
pearl

2646
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,320
um is that like you look at that you

2647
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:24,719
look at a picture of that weed and you

2648
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:26,559
hold it up to old silver pearl pictures

2649
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,719
and boy is it a ringer

2650
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,600
it's a dead ass

2651
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:33,279
man it really really looks like you know

2652
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,800
if not this i mean i'm not saying it's

2653
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:36,719
the same plant but

2654
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,320
you can really see like it's a very

2655
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,719
close resemblance

2656
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,158
and his death coast like for people if

2657
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,560
he would release death coast now or if

2658
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:47,359
that clone made it around it would smoke

2659
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,440
every i in my opinion it would smoke

2660
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:51,359
most sours it would smoke most burnt

2661
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:54,399
rubber stuff i mean it was some of the

2662
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:57,039
loudest weed i'd ever ever entertained

2663
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:58,799
it's [ __ ] crazy i love that [ __ ] yeah

2664
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:00,479
i mean he's he's got you know the cool

2665
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,159
thing about him is he breeds what he

2666
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,119
loves and he's got some pretty cool

2667
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:05,439
lines

2668
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:06,238
and he also got a bit lucky

2669
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:08,479
yeah

2670
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:09,839
you know um a couple of times i mean

2671
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:11,198
he's gotten unlucky too you know he

2672
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,800
tried to he tried to reverse his

2673
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:13,759
sauerkraut and i think he got like 20

2674
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,800
seeds

2675
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,679
yeah yeah so that's exciting you know

2676
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,279
um

2677
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:21,119
and uh

2678
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:22,880
you know silver pearl to me this is kind

2679
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:25,359
of an unusual smell but like silver

2680
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,679
pearl to me smells like baby poo

2681
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:29,119
it smells like it smells like it smells

2682
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,119
like little kid poo and they're just

2683
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:32,639
living on milk when they're very young

2684
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:33,760
before anything

2685
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,600
i know you don't know that smell but

2686
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,920
i've had a bunch of kids so it smells

2687
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,239
like that it has this weird it has one

2688
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,719
of those smells that like smells gross

2689
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:44,799
but because it's weed it's good

2690
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:47,279
that's so weird like to me i smell like

2691
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,920
a hint of bubble gummy squid and the

2692
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:51,679
rest is like dang indescribable thing

2693
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,119
like my nose smells just indescribable

2694
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:57,760
day with like sweet pleasant bubble gum

2695
01:29:55,119 --> 01:30:00,158
yeah it's it's pretty leafy and it's and

2696
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,960
it's pretty very it's pretty frosty and

2697
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:06,799
it doesn't yield that very big buds

2698
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,800
it's insanely resinous for its era

2699
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:10,800
that's for sure and it's like

2700
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,719
um it's uh

2701
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,000
what is the exact cross again it's like

2702
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:18,719
it's like is it early girl by nl5 by

2703
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,719
skunk one yes yeah early pro no five

2704
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,880
skunk yeah that's what it is and then

2705
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,279
they cross he crossed that to hayes c

2706
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:28,560
and made silver haze yeah

2707
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:30,399
um but yeah especially that death coast

2708
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,280
there's some things that pip did and he

2709
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:35,439
wasn't like a fanboy on ig and he didn't

2710
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,759
have this massive following but if

2711
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,279
people would have like bought him out

2712
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,480
the way they bought some more well-known

2713
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:42,880
breeders out they probably would have

2714
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:44,559
been happier all that money spent on

2715
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,960
other people

2716
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,639
yeah hope you enjoyed your animal mints

2717
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,920
uh did it remind you of the smell of

2718
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:52,000
shoreline no

2719
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,719
no it didn't to me

2720
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,719
uh shoreline like i said the indoor was

2721
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,239
very hot garbage the outdoor was very

2722
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,840
hot garbage and

2723
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:02,238
legit urine

2724
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,960
somebody just asked what's early pearl

2725
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,718
my understanding of early pearl is early

2726
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,719
pearl is uh

2727
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:12,399
a worked early girl

2728
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:15,279
which is um something that

2729
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:17,198
which is pollyanna crossed with uh early

2730
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:19,840
pearl i believe is pollyanna which is a

2731
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:22,000
mexican cross with early girl correct

2732
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,000
and that's what it is and it's worked

2733
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,079
stuff from rob clark

2734
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,600
yeah um the pollyanna came from rob

2735
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:31,679
clark the early the early girl huh

2736
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,000
pauliana came for rob clark there's

2737
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:36,239
there's speculation that

2738
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,960
the afghani and i think it's the afghani

2739
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:41,119
and or the mexican and pollyanna might

2740
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,800
be the mexican in skunk one that's the

2741
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:44,479
one thing we uh are trying to figure out

2742
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,360
yeah i mean there's there's some i mean

2743
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:49,678
i'm sure that uh sam and him know

2744
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:52,238
um you know but yeah he

2745
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:55,279
he was responsible for a number of early

2746
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:58,158
strains that went over to amsterdam i

2747
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,599
believe he brought over cali a uh caliel

2748
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:01,359
maybe

2749
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,079
california orange

2750
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:05,759
um and uh you know but there was a there

2751
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:06,800
was a handful of there was a handful of

2752
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,960
people

2753
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,840
um that were bringing things to holland

2754
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:13,600
and he was certainly one of them

2755
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,480
so

2756
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:19,120
um but yeah and there's no doubt that

2757
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:22,718
um rob and sam in the in that we're

2758
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:24,840
working with mexicans and colombians

2759
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,639
trying to get colombians to finish in

2760
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,159
california yeah

2761
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,440
and so they were working with various

2762
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,279
and that makes sense because that's like

2763
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:32,719
the two most important things in that

2764
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:33,599
area at the time

2765
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,439

and has been hunting uh through any kind

2778
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:59,359
of seed he can to try to see if he can

2779

find something that he remembers from

2780
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:02,960
that era

2781
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:06,799
we had a nice early early pearl cut in

2782
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:08,480
san diego too in the hog crew yeah so

2783
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,239
um so yeah you know some of that some of

2784
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:12,718
that early work some of that i don't you

2785
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:14,959
know is is really nice

2786
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,399
um and i wish it was still around for i

2787
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,000
mean there was an interesting thing i

2788
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:19,359
was talking to this gentleman from

2789
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,520
australia

2790
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,359
okay who worked with neville

2791
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,239
um some of the last years of neville's

2792
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:25,920
life

2793
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,759
yeah and he said one of neville's great

2794
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,840
regrets is that he couldn't take all the

2795
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,960
stuff he had in the 80s and 90s and work

2796
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,480
it now

2797
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,399
yeah

2798
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:36,399
with like you know 30 more years

2799
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:38,158
experience and a better

2800
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,000
sense of things and a better sense of

2801
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:42,000
the importance of things in certain

2802
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,679
aspects and he did a really good job

2803
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,198
back then

2804
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,719
yeah but i think a lot of breeders have

2805
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:48,559
that regret where it's like boy do i

2806
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,719
wish i had everything i had in the 90s

2807
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,920
and early 2000s now

2808
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,920
yeah

2809
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,520
you know um i have a lot more knowledge

2810
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,440
now

2811
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,280
smoked a lot more weed seen a lot more

2812
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:00,559
things talked a lot more

2813
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:01,519
so

2814
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,880
you know

2815
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,880
um

2816
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,480
and uh

2817
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,639
and yeah so

2818
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,079
uh that's that's early girl and you know

2819
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,679
i wish that we could get stuff from

2820
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:12,559
scentsy that was real

2821
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:15,279
um

2822
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:18,080
but um i i think those times passed

2823
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:19,359
sometime by the early to mid 2000s yeah

2824
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,119
i agree

2825
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:23,119
people asked how did they go downhill so

2826
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,840
fast so what happened to scentsy

2827
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,679
is that um they i think they were legit

2828
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,760
all throughout the 90s even after

2829
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,679
neville left they still had most of

2830
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,280
their original moms and dads and they

2831
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,760
released some things that were like

2832
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,880
unreleased neville work in the later 90s

2833
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,880
anyway

2834
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,840
and then the laws changed they got

2835
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:44,960
busted i think they lost some things

2836
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:47,039
um and then they outsourced to spain

2837
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:49,679
that was the big death now

2838
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:51,279
so at that point who i i actually

2839
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,600
believe that there could be one or two

2840
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:56,000
things amongst you know the their

2841
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,760
collection that might still exist

2842
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,118
super silver yeah that's everywhere

2843
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,639
that's one of the ones that did get

2844
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:02,399
everywhere and stayed in but you know

2845
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:05,920
but which ones are they and which ones

2846
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:07,679
are legit and which one's from who knows

2847
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:11,039
i think they've been untrustworthy for

2848
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:12,319
at least 15 15 plus years yeah

2849
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,079
sadly

2850
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:15,599
unfortunately yeah um but they had a

2851
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:17,600
good 10-year run

2852
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,760
yeah you know from the early 90s to the

2853
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,880
early 2000s they had a lot of legitimate

2854
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,840
stuff

2855
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,079
yeah

2856
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:26,159
so i would i would be very suspect of

2857
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:28,559
anything from scentsy today

2858
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,399
and the shame is that ben matt and i

2859
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,000
have talked a bunch about having ben and

2860
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:34,638
alan on

2861
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,479
um because they were there and they know

2862
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:38,719
an enormous amount about the early

2863
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:42,000
history of dutch cannabis

2864
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,039
um but they are a very dutch businessmen

2865
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,279
and we've been told that they're

2866
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:46,639
terrible interviews yeah um and they

2867
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:48,238
still claim to this day they have all

2868
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,239
the original parents

2869
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:52,000
and sensei is no different now than it

2870
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:55,279
was in the 90s

2871
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,479
um and all that type of stuff so uh

2872
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:58,719
that's hard

2873
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:00,319
they promote scentsy

2874
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,719
yep you know they're not really

2875
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:04,399
interested in in history or being

2876
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,079
accurate or telling you what they lost

2877
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:07,279
or what they have or what they like so

2878
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:08,479
they have it in there they just don't

2879
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:10,399
give a [ __ ]

2880
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:12,319
uh keeper seeds we've done a whole

2881
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:14,479
episode or two on canadian seed banks

2882
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,238
we'll probably do some more um it just

2883
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:18,238
involves getting more of the canadian

2884
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:19,919
people involved because

2885
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:21,279
me and nazar have no place telling the

2886
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,279
history of

2887
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:24,960
canada's seed banks because they're not

2888
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:26,639
yeah we do have we have a we have a good

2889
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,840
friend we chat with all the time that's

2890
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,000
from up there that has a lot of

2891
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:33,360
connections and a lot of knowledge

2892
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,880
um you know matt talked to uh

2893
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:39,599
to um a couple of times yeah yeah talk

2894
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:41,359
to red and chimera you know um there's

2895
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,800
some other friends of theirs that might

2896
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:46,639
come on at some point um but uh yeah

2897
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,719
it's not really our scene

2898
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,800
yeah and and um

2899
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,560
shaunie's gonna be probably uh

2900
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,239
interviewed we had an interview

2901
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,080
with a dude named pete from up there

2902
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:58,319
that was also part of their scene

2903
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:59,920
but sadly we don't have the audio

2904
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:01,439
anymore someone else has it and we can't

2905
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,679
get it back so we're probably going to

2906
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:05,118
do another interview again and just try

2907
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,480
to hit it from scratch johnny's going to

2908
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,238
help a lot with that because johnny's

2909
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:10,238
our canadian connect

2910
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:13,439
someone just asked what about the dudes

2911
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:15,198
that are revamping the sssc

2912
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:16,479
uh well we had a big interview with

2913
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:18,799
corel

2914
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:21,439
um so the guy that used to own

2915
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,520
the company is still alive and still a

2916
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:26,319
part of it and i believe you know he's

2917
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,920
in his 70s now probably so it's i would

2918
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:30,000
imagine his son and some other people

2919
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,840
are doing a ton um

2920
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,279
you know and it doesn't seem it

2921
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,199
certainly doesn't seem like they have a

2922
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:37,439
ton of their original stuff

2923
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:39,839
so they're trying to revamp things but

2924
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:42,399
it does seem like they have a few at

2925
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,440
least one but possibly a few very old

2926
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,118
cuttings

2927
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:47,759
yeah um that they're using sort of as

2928
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,839
the baseline to get restarted again from

2929
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,520
their work in the 80s

2930
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,039
yeah you know

2931
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,119
that was a great interview too i

2932
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:57,198
remember after that was done we were

2933
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:58,960
just so stoked like because it was

2934
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,519
special like nobody had really done a

2935
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,840
great interview with sssc in many years

2936
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,600
many many years so well if you haven't

2937
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,039
heard that stuff go check it out the

2938
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,480
other thing that i liked a bunch too was

2939
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:10,079
that obviously they talked about how

2940
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,238
they didn't have any um

2941
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:13,679
he was very upfront about quite there he

2942
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:16,000
was very upfront about most of it there

2943
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,760
was a few things where time or whatever

2944
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,840
he didn't want to speak to it

2945
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,600
um you know but he did give some really

2946
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,440
cool tidbits that we didn't know before

2947
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,400
and he added depth and he was certainly

2948
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:27,039
there

2949
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:28,479
um so all that stuff was pretty cool i

2950
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,960
think that interview probably had the

2951
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:32,479
most bombshells in it that we've done of

2952
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,039
things we didn't know

2953
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:37,519
that were unknown to most of the public

2954
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:39,600
so i think it's really cool yeah so he's

2955
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,520
so he's part he's part of the of the

2956
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,039
revamp they're certainly not going to be

2957
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,360
able to like just release their old

2958
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:47,840
catalog like it was in the 80s

2959
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:50,079
um but they do have some old things and

2960
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,440
they're mixing them with other stuff and

2961
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:53,920
you know when i interviewed him he

2962
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:56,319
seemed like an older version of us

2963
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:59,920
yeah he seemed like a cool cat you know

2964
01:38:56,319 --> 01:39:02,399
so yeah he was cool i'm into it

2965
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,679
i'm into him he was a nice man

2966
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:07,359
all right anything else you want to

things and there's you know like as

2980
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,158
always there's a bunch of stuff that the

2981
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:38,399
questions and things that i see i try to

2982
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:39,920
pick out some out of the comments if we

2983
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:41,439
didn't answer them it's not because it

2984
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,600
wasn't a good one it just didn't go with

2985
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:45,919
the flow of what we were chatting about

2986
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,679
you know so don't um so you can always

2987
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,719
ask us on the discord or you can always

2988
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:51,279
dm

2989
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:53,760
you know uh or anything like that

2990
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:56,000
and so um

2991
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,480
you know keeper topics keeper topics are

2992
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,198
hard because it's personal preference

2993
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:03,279
um what i what i consider a keeper you

2994
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:05,599
might not consider a keeper

2995
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:08,158
we might have different criteria um the

2996
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:11,119
biggest criteria that i would say for a

2997
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:14,079
keeper for you is do you enjoy the the

2998
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:16,799
flavor of the high and the way it burns

2999
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:19,359
yeah those are like you know do you like

3000
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,600
if you personally like it a whole bunch

3001
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:24,238
um then it could be a keeper

3002
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,920
you know if if i don't like the flavor

3003
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:27,678
of something even if i like the high

3004
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,520
it's not very likely that i'll keep

3005
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,279
smoking it for myself but some people

3006
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,000
may prefer the high over the flavor so

3007
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:37,039
that's why it's very i mean

3008
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,279
obviously it's it's the easier to a

3009
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:41,118
keeper becomes easier when when she

3010
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:43,759
checks all the boxes

3011
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,880
yeah you know i mean grandpa used to say

3012
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,719
there's nothing wrong with rich and

3013
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,600
beautiful you know

3014
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:49,920
uh

3015
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:53,600
but um you know so obviously if you have

3016
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:55,920
phenomenal high and incredible flavor uh

3017
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,400
that's great but you know there's plants

3018
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,199
i keep that don't have a very potent

3019
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:01,118
high

3020
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:02,079
but have other aspects that i like quite

3021
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:04,158
a bit

3022
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:06,079
um and there's there's the reverse too i

3023
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:06,879
mean i've talked a bunch about that that

3024
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:08,079
uh

3025
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,719
um

3026
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:13,359
that peacemaker that you know the uh the

3027
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:15,198
great white shark cut that i had that

3028
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:16,158
was almost hallucinogenic it was so

3029
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:18,960
strong

3030
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:22,319
but it tasted like smoke i couldn't find

3031
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,319
a good one that had any flavor

3032
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,440
so

3033
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:27,759
