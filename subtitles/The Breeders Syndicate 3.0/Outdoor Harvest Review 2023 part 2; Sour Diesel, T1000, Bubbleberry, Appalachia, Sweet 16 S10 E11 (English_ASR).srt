42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,479
show uh all right there was one more

43
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,718
strain I wanted to talk about that kind

44
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,438
of caught my attention from last year

45
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:55,919
and it was um something I got from my

46
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,758
buddy from anaku genetics up in Seattle

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,118
he sent me something called Isn't She

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,560
Lovely and it's um it's a purple

49
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,680
Pineapple Express to a gorilla glue

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,199
number four and it was the first time I

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,519
had seen uh a heavy purple plant that

52
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,799
smelled like pure pining so it I I I

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,719
smelled pining and and gotten really

54
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,280
nice Pine smells out of out of a lot of

55
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,840
strains but never a dark purple strain

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
um and there's there's hint of like a

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,439
little carolene or a little pepper in

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,840
there but it's mostly dominated by

59
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,719
pining and so that that's another one

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,840
that struck me as interesting and struck

61
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,878
other people when I'm sharing or when

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,200
when I'm cracking jars somebody will

63
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,000
will grab the grab that jar and you know

64
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,399
they'll be surprised just as much as I

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
am to get that kind of smell out of

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,879
Purple weed it's uh it was another one

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,039
of the highlights of of last year's grow

68
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,039
for

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,919
me nice that nice have you ever like

70
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,719
been to a party or a contest or maybe

71
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,238
just

72
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,359
like a group of friends together that

73
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,719
they all bring their jars and like you

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
look everybody's opening and and and

75
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,959
smelling and like you look like over the

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,400
course of the night or the day or

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,439
whatever and seeing like certain jars

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,080
will just be rans sacked and other ones

79
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,318
are still sitting there full have you

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,159
guys ever noticed that it's like a table

81
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,919
test it's like you're not really

82
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,798
watching but like that like it tells you

83
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,039
what other people are liking you know

84
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,599
what I mean yeah that was that's what

85
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,679
happened at the party last year is there

86
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,238
were lots of jars that were emptied

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
quickly and there were lots of jars that

88
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,360
were still Plum full left on the table

89
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:44,120
that's always fun to see honestly you

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,560
know yeah had it happen yeah kind of it

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,680
tells the story itself you know you

92
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,158
don't it talks for itself it's like an

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,920
unofficial little judge judgment and

94
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,840
it's like oh okay it's a poll right it's

95
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,639
like a everyone's voting basically right

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,319
maybe you know what I'm just thinking

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,639
about it right to make it as objective

98
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,719
as possible people shouldn't see how

99
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,719
much is left in each jar because that

100
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,680
might in of itself encourage more people

101
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,919
to like take from the same jar so I feel

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,680
like the jars should like be opaque or

103
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,639
something for it to be like a good test

104
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,920
because otherwise people are just going

105
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,919
to notice which jar is already

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,519
empty yeah anyway

107
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,199
sorry um yeah I think uh I think that

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,360
covers it mostly for for stuff well we

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,038
we could

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,840
want to have a second did peaches want

111
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,680
to have a second round of

112
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,439
highlights um you know the only I would

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,319
say the other one that I really enjoyed

114
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,519
in the uh Garden this year was Riot's

115
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,199
bubbleberry

116
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,519
V2 um it really did well there was some

117
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,000
blueberry T TPS and a few of them that

118
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:56,038
were just you know really nice and it it

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,279
was one of the best growing ones as far

120
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:00,478
as structure wise the way it grew it

121
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,599
didn't hardly need any kind of staking

122
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,800
or anything um I was really happy with

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,039
that one so nice seems to be

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,360
consistently one of the easiest you know

125
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:15,879
best growing things around um because

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,520
like everyone says that and I I saw that

127
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,959
too myself yeah I got a pack of the

128
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,959
bubbleberry that I'm waiting to go for

129
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,439
next year I wanted to do it this year

130
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:29,918
but I decided to do the the blue garig

131
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:32,839
and the uh the uh the the Kush Bonnet um

132
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,359
whatever the blue resin cush this is

133
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,079
just some arm armchair breeder

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,639
theorizing for me but I I wonder if it's

135
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,839
like one step away from becoming

136
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,319
something like quite amazing in terms of

137
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,959
like it's got such a strong base I feel

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,319
like or is such a good base for

139
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,918
something and I feel

140
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,080
like it's perfectly gray as it is but I

141
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,240
wonder if something could kind of like

142
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,560
take it take it a little bit further I

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,519
just don't know what that this is

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,319
specifically the bubbleberry V2 your the

145
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,079
bubbleberry yeah okay I'd like to cross

146
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,039
it with the barber

147
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,159
bud that's what I'd like to do with it

148
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,360
cuz I

149
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,479
wash um I went up and I washed what 3.6

150
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,120
lbs of

151
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,478
bubbleberry um and unfortunately she's

152
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,918
not a washer at least not the fenos I

153
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,639
had um but I have a feeling that in her

154
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,839
is some potential and then I think if it

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,000
gets crossed you know cuz the barber bud

156
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,159
is shishkaberry by Afghani one and I

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
just think if we took that

158
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,240
the bubbleberry V2 and put them together

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,240
that you could get some really good

160
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,840
crosses and then increase the potential

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,840
for washing a little bit

162
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,919
better hell yeah

163
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,560
interesting all right yeah so I think

164
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
that does a a pretty good job of just

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,918
going over what what we grew last year

166
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,279
and what we were what we're really

167
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,639
elated with and for the next little

168
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,359
segment I think it would be fun to talk

169
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,960
about um and this doesn't have to be a

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,800
long segment we can't there's not a lot

171
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,000
of juice to squeeze out of here but just

172
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,879
talking about postseason cleanup um

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,800
preparations for next year do you guys

174
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,560
do everything after fall and it's all

175
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
prepped for when spring comes around or

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,319
do you let the winter happen and then

177
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,160
prep in Spring and uh you know what kind

178
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,120
of entails prepping for for your

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,840
Following season um it'll be the next

180
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,598
little topic that we go over uh little

181
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,560
Hill you want you want to start us off

182
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,918
here and tell us what your postseason

183
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,839
operations is like well I I do the least

184
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,198
amount possible I I'm usually pretty

185
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:48,359
burnt out and and ready to call it a

186
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:50,439
season by the end yeah and um I mean I

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,280
planted a cover crop in September while

188
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:57,598
there were still plants in the ground um

189
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,079
it it still hasn't really taken yet and

190
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,959
I don't know why I've always had issues

191
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,359
with with cover crops there and they've

192
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,799
always been very hard to to get going

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,400
before before winter um so I'll Reed

194
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,639
again this spring and and see what I can

195
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,359
get going the cover crop was a mix of

196
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,800
everything Clover

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,879
legumes um

198
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,759
grasses everything okay um just because

199
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,280
I don't know what's really gonna perform

200
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,120
for me um and I've tried this over the

201
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,318
years so much and the the weeds seem to

202
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,280
do fine so those will get tilled back in

203
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,038
but um coover besides cover cropping

204
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,679
like I roll up my trellises to reuse the

205
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,718
the trellis netting because my beds are

206
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,559
long and linear

207
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,519
um I'm I'm I'm actually glad that works

208
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,879
out well because I I can use that

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,879
trellis for years and uh that stuff's

210
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,720
expensive so um but as far as like yeah

211
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,879
not not much else in the order of

212
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,000
cleanup um you know besides like

213
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,399
disconnecting irrigation and stuff like

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,679
that my stems are still in the ground

215
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,200
um there's no sense in wrestling them

216
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,278
out at the end of the season because if

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,680
you just let them rot they will pull out

218
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:13,278
with no effort in the springtime yeah so

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,000
that's that's what I let them do and

220
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,000
then you leave most of that roof ball in

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,958
the soil which is good to break down in

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,519
there and you're really just pulling out

223
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,639
the stem which uh makes life a lot

224
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,399
easier if you you can spend you can

225
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,720
spend days pulling out root balls and

226
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,399
it's just there's just no point Y they

227
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,480
come out so easy after they brought and

228
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,360
you know I don't have to like I don't

229
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,639
have to remove all trace of of evidence

230
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,079
of a grow so I I don't have to worry

231
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,519
about that but if you you know that's if

232
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,199
you have to do that that's that's

233
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,839
different but I don't so I definitely

234
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,839
like Lum

235
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:54,439
Rod yeah oh one other thing sorry

236
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:57,278
uh for the greenh houses I I have to

237
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,839
take my skins off um in the winter

238
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,838
because they'll just collapse under snow

239
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,200
load

240
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,440
oh yeah rather than taking them off and

241
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,120
pulling them back on which is such a

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,480
task um we just roll them up to the

243
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,120
center of the greenhouse um because they

244
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,360
have roll up sides anyway so we just

245
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,240
keep rolling them all the way up to the

246
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,519
very peak of the greenhouse and then tie

247
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,079
them off up

248
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,679
there

249
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,599
and there's not enough room for snow to

250
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,399
really

251
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,200
collect and uh and that that makes

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,399
putting them on in the spring a heck of

253
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,000
a lot easier just have to untie and let

254
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,519
let gravity do the rest and right right

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,240
so it's so much nicer than wrestling

256
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,600
with those things in the spring and the

257
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,200
wind and all that stuff you guys they're

258
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,879
big green houses they're 108 feet long

259
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,759
some of them and um it it's a

260
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,759
task so that's my that's my into of

261
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,838
season

262
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,519
breakdown yeah I'm in I'm in the same uh

263
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm in the same boat as you by the end

264
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,679
of the season I'm just and I'm in trim

265
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,720
jail

266
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,439
my I'm not I'm not too worried about

267
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,600
cleaning up everything down there at the

268
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,279
at the end of the plot and it like you

269
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,920
said like I've there are years where at

270
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,879
the end of the at the end of the year I

271
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,919
I tried uprooting everything and trying

272
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,399
to knock that dirt out of those root

273
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,759
balls you know just sitting there just

274
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,600
beating the hell out of it trying to get

275
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,838
all the dirt out of it yeah that's

276
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,800
that's no fun after after a couple of

277
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,959
season that I just I wait wait until the

278
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,199
the Winter's over wait till that snow's

279
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,638
gone wait for that defrost to come

280
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,440
through and uh and then I start working

281
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,399
my pots and and pulling that stuff out

282
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,880
of there um last year I had a little bit

283
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,639
of a scare is my pots were

284
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:45,958
frozen H like up into to March almost

285
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,000
yeah yeah I was going to say up into

286
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,278
March I I still had my pots that were

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,600
just sitting outside frozen solid I was

288
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,600
trying to get my shovel into them and

289
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,040
not getting anywhere because the the

290
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,000
soil was frozen solid in those

291
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:03,360
pots yeah we had a win last

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,919
year yeah yeah it was it was some heavy

293
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,000
late winter heavy late winners last year

294
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,399
yeah there was there was some moments

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,679
there where I was wondering if I'm going

296
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,240
to be able to get out on June 1st

297
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,439
wondering about the the late night temps

298
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,240
that I'm looking

299
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,040
at um yeah like uh it it depends varies

300
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,639
varies from year to year there are some

301
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,159
years while I'll go down there and I'll

302
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,519
cut stocks and I'll make uh I'll make

303
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,838
like walking sticks or I'll use the

304
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,198
bigger stem the the bigger stalks on the

305
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,440
bigger plants for some sort of art or

306
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,359
craft or some sort of hanging bar that

307
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,000
that'll go up in one of the sheds or

308
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,120
something um but other than that yeah

309
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,639
it's you know once Harvest is done I I

310
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,560
leave most of that stuff down there and

311
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,440
and a lot of that work gets done uh

312
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,599
before the before the spring season

313
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
before I'm thinking about transplanting

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,000
plants

315
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,199
Outdoors

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,799
cool what about you

317
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:08,399
peaches well

318
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,159
um there's been a couple years where I

319
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,919
haven't been able to pull off getting

320
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,240
anything done after harvest because

321
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:19,360
things have been too much and too crazy

322
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,600
but um this year um I actually managed

323
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,919
to do everything I wanted which was I

324
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:29,040
went back through and turned all the

325
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:32,958
pots I added compost and biochar and

326
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,519
then planted a winter cover crop that

327
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,278
has like 12 different things in it and

328
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,159
uh started watering it and they got them

329
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:45,679
I got them to sprout and they're now all

330
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,278
full so um that's what I try to do

331
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,559
sometimes I don't get to it I got to

332
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:53,958
pull down all the bamboo pick up all the

333
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,879
uh you know twine I we use hemp twine to

334
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,319
go between the bamboo for all our

335
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,399
trellising and stuff uh

336
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,680
and so we take all that down make sure

337
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,919
there's nothing left up there no trash

338
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,679
no twine put all the bamboo away and

339
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,679
then let it go till

340
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:17,000
Springtime yeah seems to be a pretty

341
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,320
concise uh agreement amongst a lot of

342
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,519
outdoor guys is by the end of that

343
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,839
season we're you know we're we're hands

344
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,399
are full and and we're pretty exhausted

345
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,720
from doing stuff since Mother's Day

346
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,519
right it is yeah speaking of speaking of

347
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,959
a heavy winter last year I had something

348
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,159
happen to me for the first time and in

349
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:41,039
this little Valley um I so for my water

350
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,000
source I'm

351
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:49,799
about where I actually grow my outdoor

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,958
plants I'm about 200 225 yards away from

353
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,879
a creek a natural Creek Inlet and so I

354
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,958
have

355
00:14:53,879 --> 00:15:00,360
120 I think 120 gallon tote that I fill

356
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,359
with the creek water water and then spig

357
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,800
it and tap off of that just to hand

358
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,199
water my plants with a with a normal

359
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:12,078
hose off of that um but I use a little a

360
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:16,359
little pump to pump uh Creek Water that

361
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:19,198
225 feet over to my tote so uh and for

362
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,800
the past 11 or 12 years now in this

363
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,240
specific spot I've always left my pump

364
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,639
outdoors and I've never drained it and

365
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,360
never had an issue with the with the

366
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,159
water freezing inside and destroying the

367
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,800
pump

368
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,439
well last year our winter was bad enough

369
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,639
that it uh it split the bell housing the

370
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,480
pump housing it liter it basically

371
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,600
cracked the thing straight in half and I

372
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,000
was like whoa that's the first time I've

373
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,800
seen that happen it was it got pretty

374
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
cold down in that Valley last year for

375
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,039
it to to finally freeze the water in

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,120
that pump and cause it to expand like

377
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,759
that that's the the first encounter I've

378
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,759
had with a pump freezing over like

379
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
that

380
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,560
yeah ice will ice will break

381
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,559
metal if you let it yeah for sure it

382
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,239
looked like it it did it pretty easily

383
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,000
too it didn't look like it had that hard

384
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,759
of a time doing

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,919
it yeah I definitely had a lot of damage

386
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,600
over winter mostly fences but uh I've

387
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,078
definitely had some pipes break not

388
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,040
metal but it was it was a bad winter

389
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,000
knock on wood this winter doesn't seem

390
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,679
as bad we have a big storm coming right

391
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,919
now but it looks mostly it looks like

392
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,399
mostly rain with with snow on the back

393
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,879
end but not much but right hopefully

394
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,879
that holds

395
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,039
up yep so for postseason cleanup I think

396
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
that pretty much covers that topic I

397
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,919
mean you know we all we all kind of do

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,318
the same thing we do what we can when we

399
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,439
can and uh so to to round off this

400
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:55,000
discussion and finish the last little

401
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,519
portion um uh let's just talk about what

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,759
we're excited about for the following

403
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,159
year or for for the upcoming year and

404
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,640
this could include strains this could

405
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:10,000
include new uh new additions to the farm

406
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,559
um new plans you have uh you know uh new

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,759
equipment that you plan on using just

408
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,558
anything for this following up for this

409
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,879
coming up year that that you're excited

410
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,519
to to grow or excited to use in the

411
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,199
garden

412
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,160
um uh peaches let's let's start with you

413
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,600
what what's what's got you excited for

414
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,320
for this upcoming

415
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:33,279
year um well uh I actually have my Barb

416
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,558
that I'm going to get to put out as

417
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,599
clones um and my keeper feno so I'm

418
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:42,279
excited about that cuz usually we do

419
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:44,319
everything from seed and so um I'm

420
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:47,519
looking forward to not having to you

421
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,200
know kick out males and know what I have

422
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,839
and then

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,519
um yeah that's always fun and then I I

424
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,839
also have some seeds uh they were

425
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,599
calling it

426
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:03,000
Barbarella um and and it's a Barbara Bud

427
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:06,199
cross with Renee uh but recently they

428
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,279
renamed it sweet peach because it is

429
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,880
supposed to be peachier than the barber

430
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:14,639
bud and I happened when I bought the

431
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,480
barber Bud to get a free pack of that so

432
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,120
um I'm really really excited about that

433
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,360
one because I'm hoping for even more

434
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,119
Peach chirps that wait but are you mad

435
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,879
that they called it sweet peach well no

436
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,918
I

437
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,520
mean everybody like there's now a sour

438
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,080
Peach there's all kinds of stuff so you

439
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,079
know it is what it is um it would have

440
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,839
been nice cuz I would have probably

441
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:44,119
planned on naming my feno and something

442
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:47,079
I make that but it's okay um it is what

443
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,319
it is I'm just happy to find Peach TPS

444
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,199
so um that's what I'm just really

445
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,119
looking forward to that barbar Bella and

446
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,080
then like I said having some clones

447
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,798
already to go and not having to do the

448
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:00,960
whole seed thing this time um I'm kind

449
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:00,960
of looking for forward to that

450
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,480
part it's good to hear it's good to hear

451
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,200
it's always nice to have something

452
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,599
you're excited for and especially you're

453
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,679
looking forward to grow for the

454
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,798
following

455
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,919
year yeah it's a little different cuz

456
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,119
normally I'm I mean I'm excited but I'm

457
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,120
not sure what we're going to get and

458
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,558
have because we you know choose seeds

459
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,558
and we've been searching through this

460
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,158
and that and so this year the main focus

461
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,038
is going to be on just a couple of

462
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,120
strains that we've already grown and we

463
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,480
know what to expect from them so right

464
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,079
that's been something that's kind of

465
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,038
addictive for me the more that I pop the

466
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,319
The Wider spectrum of these seeds and go

467
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,480
further into these genetics is not

468
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:46,599
knowing what you're going to get is as

469
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,720
equal or almost more exciting to me than

470
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,879
like unnown cut that I know is going to

471
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,038
perform well like that they they hold

472
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,240
the same equal value in my brain they

473
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,240
both scratch the same itch you

474
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
know

475
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,000
um what about you Hill what what are you

476
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:08,079
super excited about growing for next

477
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,880
year um I'm I'm I'm excited about

478
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,960
growing less strains honestly I I grew

479
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
such a variety this year just to see

480
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,880
what was going to work for me in my

481
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,879
expansion um I'm I'm I'm looking forward

482
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,120
to having that narrowed down to to four

483
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,720
main strains in the outdoor the Phoenix

484
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:30,038
papaya bomb Mochi runs and ice cream

485
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,400
cake and then in the uh in the depths

486
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:34,960
it's going to be a whole lot of ice

487
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,679
cream cake and a little Mochi runs and

488
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,360
then uh couple other green houses will

489
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,440
have long finishers like sour diesel and

490
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,519
blue dream but uh there might be some

491
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,679
cat piss in there as well on the early

492
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:52,519
early light dep because it does well in

493
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:55,280
the cold but other than that um my uh my

494
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:58,319
little side side seed Garden where I get

495
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,000
to like grow some stuff and and hunt

496
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,519
through some stuff that I

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,440
like either for personal or just to

498
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:09,639
maybe work some breeding projects and

499
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,798
and just and just be a just be a hobby

500
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,480
grower in a little small space um I'm

501
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,839
I've got a collection of maybe six

502
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,759
poodle nuts crosses that I'm going to

503
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,480
grow out along with clones from those

504
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,839
two s1s I like um okay so I'm excited to

505
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,278
look through those it's a pretty wide

506
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:32,038
variety um I got Bubba cook to to poodle

507
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:34,519
nuts from Caleb those are old seed that

508
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,558
he used to give away his freebies um

509
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:39,759
like oh man that sounds great though

510
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,599
yeah the first bubak cush was the first

511
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,240
thingy reversed to start his seed

512
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,959
company so it's from that it's from that

513
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,480
lot um so that's that's going back quite

514
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,679
some time who knows how many will

515
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,880
germinate um I've got can I ask uh just

516
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:59,880
quickly the the URL itself is it is it

517
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:03,640
quite a slow viure oh yeah big time

518
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:07,679
get Bubba as well um Bubba does a little

519
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,799
bit better um also a very squat very

520
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,400
slow lots of nodes um short internal

521
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,278
length just like just like Urkel but

522
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Bubba's still it's still grows faster

523
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:20,839
than Urkel

524
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,038
Urkel's Urkel's just one of the slowest

525
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,119
and then and then when you flip it it it

526
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,960
doesn't stretch that much so you really

527
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,879
got to veg it to

528
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,798
size

529
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,799
right yeah um so most URL phenotypes

530
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,798
like the poodle nuts is a URL phenotype

531
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,359
of its cross just like t1000s URL pheno

532
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,200
type of vcross they're definitely on the

533
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:46,558
shorter end of plants

534
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,759
um what other crosses oh uh I got one

535
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:54,440
from Matt uh which is uh one of his

536
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:58,079
blueberry crosses cross to uh poodle

537
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:01,679
nuts or blue bonnet cross to poodle nuts

538
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:04,000
I got a pood nuts backat cross from high

539
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,000
and Lonesome I've

540
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,679
got a pood nuts to Kim 91 from uh goat

541
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,200
and monkey

542
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,000
seeds um and I've also got some poodle

543
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,759
nuts to Triangle Kush from goat and

544
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,278
monkey and I bet I'm forgetting one I

545
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,960
can't remember so you like Pol nuts I

546
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:25,000
love it I love it and it crosses the

547
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,640
smells the smells really translate well

548
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,880
they're dominant in the crosses which is

549
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,080
oh been surprising to me but it just it

550
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,520
crosses well to Sour Diesel and honestly

551
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,439
that's why I want to get poodle nuts

552
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,240
back so I can cross it to Sour Diesel

553
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,240
and grow those out that's really what I

554
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,599
want to do and uh okay but you know if I

555
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,200
can't get the cut back I'm growing out

556
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,119
these other varieties and I'm going to

557
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,278
see what's what um possibly do some

558
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,639
crosses but we'll see and then uh sorry

559
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:55,720
you did say this earlier but one thing

560
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,799
is poodle

561
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,159
nuts urle to kimd

562
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,960
sorry remind me yeah not kimd but it's a

563
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:08,159
kimd uh 3x three

564
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:12,360
3bx so it's sort of kimy um it's called

565
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:15,278
Trace dog that uh do I got it yeah JJ

566
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:20,399
did a long time ago and then made the

567
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:24,798
cross to URL um yeah so it is it is it

568
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,640
is very much kimd cross um and then I'm

569
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,480
going to grow out a bunch of old heart

570
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,360
attack cush seeds looking for some early

571
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,558
finishing plants that I know are in that

572
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,519
genetic line which is cush cleaner to

573
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:40,639
sfv or sfv to Kush

574
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,759
cleaner and uh there's these are some

575
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,278
f2s I made from that

576
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,158
cross

577
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:50,440
um and uh hopefully gonna find some

578
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,960
early finishers that's definitely on the

579
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,798
terpinolene scale I've always I've I've

580
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,840
kind of like steered clear of too much

581
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,000
terpinolene in my garden over the years

582
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,439
just because buyers kind of thumb their

583
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,440
noses at it but I feel

584
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
like it's a it's a t because it's so

585
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,320
dominant in everything it's cross to

586
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,200
like it's very easy for everything to

587
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,278
end up smelling like Jack Jacker or

588
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,480
trinoline or Jack TPS as people call it

589
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:22,159
or pine or or whatever you want to call

590
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,278
it um I I feel like the

591
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,399
the the the Next Generation hasn't been

592
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:31,038
exposed to it like we

593
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:33,359
have and and

594
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,558
so as long as it checks all the other

595
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,759
boxes and for me it needs to be early

596
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,000
because I want something to finish early

597
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,240
and to get my outdoor Harvest started

598
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,880
early um I mean it seems to me to

599
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,599
function really well as a Counterpoint

600
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,679
to something else if you can get it to

601
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,678
work with something else right like

602
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:57,759
alongside another nice

603
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,960
trip to me it's just it just overpowers

604
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,679
everything it's crossed to

605
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,679
so you you might find something that has

606
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,679
a little bit of both but for the most

607
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,759
part you're just going to get hit in the

608
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,320
face with a pine tree well maybe this is

609
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,720
why the Santa Cruz Ricks are interesting

610
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,759
to me because it does seem like there's

611
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,240
an actual shot of getting like a

612
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,640
blueberry terpinolene like a decent

613
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,839
balance uh I but I could be wrong that's

614
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:29,600
what I I me if if that's the case that's

615
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,599
great um or maybe you got lucky but

616
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,880
um the high like having Tor pinolene in

617
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,559
there I think is good regardless just

618
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,120
because I think it adds to a more

619
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,079
euphoric sort of energetic High which

620
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,798
you know most of us are looking for it's

621
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,639
it's easy to find the lethargic high but

622
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,918
if you can find that high that makes you

623
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,320
clean your house and get motivated to do

624
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,960
stuff that's that's always a fun tool in

625
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,558
the toolbox you know for for certain

626
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,798
occasions and I've always found that in

627
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:03,960
in the terpinolene strains um the you

628
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,639
know they're typically they're more

629
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,960
narrow Leaf

630
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:14,640
cultivars um uh Hayes has a lot of it uh

631
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,278
deran poison has a lot of it train wreck

632
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,679
um so some of the super silver hazes

633
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:23,599
that have gone around have been tpine

634
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:27,679
dominant I've heard that too yes

635
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,359
and I mean all those Colombian Panama

636
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,600
high they could they all have that in

637
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:37,000
there big time so um and we know what

638
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:39,000
kind of high those things have so I I I

639
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,720
I I'll like having it in my garden as

640
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,200
long as it sells I don't know if it will

641
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,240
or not but for me having an earlier

642
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,000
finisher and this is just a genetic line

643
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,480
I happen to have in my fridge and I know

644
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,398
it's there because I've grown a lot of

645
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,038
it over the years

646
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,000
um it's just kind of like hey let's

647
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:58,240
let's bring back some old stuff and see

648
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,798
how it works and maybe maybe it doesn't

649
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
you know but like I've got a little bit

650
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:04,759
of space so where I can experiment and

651
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,398
and do things like that just in in hopes

652
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,038
of finding something new that that

653
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,038
really works for me as a as a

654
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,689
grower very

655
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,690
[Music]

656
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:23,199
nice and that's yeah that's about that's

657
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,880
about what I have cooking for next

658
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,558
year sweet

659
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,799
sweet I'm uh I'm super I'm super

660
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:34,240
interested to see um especially with

661
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:39,079
Bubba kind of making a little bit of

662
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,599
that Resurgence and and uh you know um

663
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,639
CSI starting to starting to do a little

664
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,839
more work with it I'm curious to see how

665
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,440
more prevalent it it start if it's

666
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,119
cyclical and starts coming back around

667
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,000
more because Bubba was one of the first

668
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,479
like uh one of the first ones that

669
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,440
really stood out to me in my my younger

670
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,319
and earlier days of smoking it was the

671
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,360
first one that really floored

672
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,879
me who was

673
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,240
that uh it was me thousand oh that was

674
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,200
thousand okay yeah pubba Kush was one of

675
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,319
the first ones that really floored you

676
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,679
yeah yeah so with with csi's upcoming

677
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,639
work I'm I'm kind of curious to see if

678
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,960
if we see a Resurgence in the community

679
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,840
where a lot more people are playing

680
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,600
around with it now that would make me

681
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,480
really happy um and that's that's one of

682
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,558
the things that I mixed personally that

683
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm excited for to try next year um I

684
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,480
plan

685
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,359
on looking through csi's catalog and

686
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
there's two things that that I want to

687
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,839
pick up to to try for next year one of

688
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,480
them um would be I want to try the

689
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:49,119
humble uppercut by itself um I believe

690
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,519
Hill you were saying that you guys also

691
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:55,239
got cantaloupe or like sweet honeydew

692
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,399
melon out of the The Humble dupper cuts

693
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,319
that you were growing and the the the

694
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:02,959
sweet 16 humble derer cut that I grew

695
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,439
was a dead ringer for cantaloupe like

696
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,840
smelling the plant I I couldn't believe

697
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,038
how closely related to to cantaloupe it

698
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,918
was and that just made me want to want

699
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:14,640
to go back to the root of the humble

700
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,840
duber cut and and pop some of those and

701
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,759
see what's hanging out there um that was

702
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:21,119
you right little Hill that was talking

703
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,398
about the humble Tupper cut no no I I

704
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,918
didn't grow that one okay I must I can't

705
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:27,518
remember who I was talking to but they

706
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,278
they they had a friend that and a family

707
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,640
member who also grew them and they were

708
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,880
mentioning cantaloupe turps and and I

709
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,559
just I liked that line through and it

710
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,679
made me want to go back to the to the

711
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,240
original to see where it's coming from

712
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,720
um that and

713
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,759
also buying some of the some of the new

714
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,558
Bubba cush stuff that that he's got out

715
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,839
so I'll probably be running some humbled

716
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,278
uppercut and some Bubba cush stuff for

717
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:56,759
uh for next year's outdoor um one of the

718
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:58,759
sweet 16 hybrids that I was given but

719
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,398
didn't get a chance to pop was the

720
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:05,679
bubble gum um I'm really curious to see

721
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,959
if the sweet 16 bubble gum cross keeps

722
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,759
it uh you know if it comes across with

723
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,880
bubblegum turps but still has the

724
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,079
potency and the the pungent you know

725
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
fermenting smells that come from the

726
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:20,000
sweet 16 it could really bolster those

727
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,679
bubble gum turps that seem to fall off

728
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,759
in every bubble gum strain that I've

729
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,798
grown so far I haven't had anything that

730
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:29,839
smells like bubble gum in flour and

731
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:32,038
I harvest it get it in jars and the

732
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,079
bubble gum transfers over it it almost

733
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:35,679
always

734
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,798
dissipates that sounds exciting that

735
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,960
that cross just because bubble gum bu

736
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:44,240
bubblegum does so well outdoors and has

737
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,480
good finishing times and it it's such a

738
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,558
sweet Frosty bud but yeah if you if it

739
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,639
could do something to help it retain

740
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,879
that smell and flavor that that would be

741
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,519
that would be absolutely killer and it's

742
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
been it's been a great hybrid for

743
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,960
outdoor grow ERS as well anything

744
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,240
crossed to Bubblegum has been has done

745
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,399
well for people and same with Bubba I

746
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,359
haven't grown the Bubba the bubblegum

747
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,398
crosses but I've grown a lot of Bubba

748
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,199
cush crosses uh Outdoors like fullterm

749
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,918
back back when we were growing big

750
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,360
plants and I was super surprised not

751
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,240
being a huge bub cush fan I was so

752
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,759
surprised how big these plants got they

753
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,839
still had those big broad leaves that

754
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:30,359
Bubba Kush has but they were [ __ ]

755
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,759
enormous and you know there most of them

756
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:35,398
were OG

757
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:39,158
crosses um they they got

758
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:42,719
absolutely huge um that is surprising to

759
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,720
me for sure yeah they loved the NorCal

760
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,798
sun and some of the biggest biggest

761
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,319
outdoor plants I've ever had all the

762
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:51,278
biggest plants outdoor plants I've ever

763
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,839
had have been from seed but these were

764
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,440
especially just girthy because of the

765
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,879
size of their leaves and the thickness

766
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,679
of their stems um I even had a huge

767
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,720
Windstorm where the top of the plant

768
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,440
actually blew off the plant so like the

769
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,038
top maybe two and a half feet so that

770
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,798
top Cola they weren't topped or anything

771
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:15,839
actually it looked like a grenade went

772
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,638
off in the plant and there were trell

773
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,439
and everything but the that that stem

774
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:22,359
just blew straight off the plant and

775
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,960
this was in September and it was it was

776
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:30,038
a loss on on that part that blew off but

777
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,558
um yeah like a grenade went off so I I

778
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:35,638
would have thought that a Bubba type

779
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,519
would be quite mold prone as

780
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:41,439
well yeah you would think that I mean

781
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,839
that makes sense big thick indicia buds

782
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,360
um I didn't have any

783
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,519
issues I typically didn't have mold

784
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,558
issues back in the day growing big

785
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,278
outdoor plants um I was selecting

786
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,319
strains that wouldn't mold on me but

787
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:57,079
like stuff that molds on other people

788
00:33:54,319 --> 00:34:00,000
didn't mold for me but I didn't I didn't

789
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,678
have any issues CSI might say different

790
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,638
where he was because I know he always

791
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,840
had more mold problems than I did yeah

792
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:09,838
but uh it's I don't know maybe it's just

793
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,398
part of the Vigor but like the buds were

794
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:15,119
dense and like all the all the

795
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,799
parameters were there for bad mold uh I

796
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,919
just I just never had that

797
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,560
issue has anyone done a bubblegum Bubba

798
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:28,239
cross I

799
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,559
haven't interesting it's it's one of the

800
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,118
reasons that has me so interested well

801
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,960
it's not it's a keystone factor into why

802
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm curious about trying The Sweet 16

803
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,039
bubble gum is it's notorious mold

804
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
resistance and and Bud rot resistance um

805
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:48,398
uh you I I don't have any uh fears of

806
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,159
running that sweet 16 bubble gum

807
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:55,679
Outdoors as long as it can go full term

808
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:58,400
um the two other examples of the bubble

809
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,838
gum cut that CS I use that I grew in my

810
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,119
garden they were grown Outdoors endured

811
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:08,759
multiple rainstorms that were over an

812
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,880
inch and even the the Albert Walker

813
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,560
bubblegum survived ice like there were

814
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,000
there was snow that landed on it and

815
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:20,078
then froze and it was like actual I I

816
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,559
had to like thump the nugs to get ice

817
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,920
sheets of ice to fall off the buds and

818
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:28,719
there was not a trace of mildew not a

819
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,119
trace of mold not a trace of Bud rot I

820
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,679
was really impressed with the impervious

821
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,640
qualities to mold that his bubble gum

822
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:39,319
cut had and that Albert Walker bubble

823
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:43,279
gum plant that I had it had every chance

824
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:45,720
to to create mold it had it had exposed

825
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,119
uh Branch exposed stems and branches

826
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:51,439
that were rubbed and had uh had dead

827
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,318
cell material on it it had uh Decay fan

828
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,720
leafes there was all and it had plenty

829
00:35:53,318 --> 00:36:00,199
of moisture all of the the right um

830
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:04,078
qualifiers to create a moldy mess were

831
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,598
there and it just didn't happen so yeah

832
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,440
I'm I'm really curious to see what the

833
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,800
sweet 16 bubble gum does next year um I

834
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,159
I might end up doing probably two maybe

835
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,960
three plants or I I could go with the uh

836
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:21,078
the method that I did with the sweet 16

837
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,119
Kim D's and grow three of them in one

838
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,960
pot and kind of let them VI for control

839
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,119
and fight for each other for some five

840
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,760
six foot tall plants instead of some 10

841
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,599
foot tall

842
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,319
monsters um yeah so next year I'm I'm

843
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,160
excited about the bubak cush stuff I'm

844
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:40,960
excited about more sweet 16 stuff um I'm

845
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:43,039
going to I'm going to go back and I'm

846
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,880
going to run some more Appalachia stuff

847
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,920
but this time I'm probably going to run

848
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,280
the Appalachia f3s just to get a sense

849
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,119
of the green crack and the trest dog

850
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,319
mixed together

851
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:59,200
um I like those now oh nice nice I I

852
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:01,800
liked everything that I saw out of the

853
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,039
Appalachia hybrids mostly the outdoor

854
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Vigor literally just growing giant

855
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,960
Butterball bushes so I want to go back

856
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,239
to the the core Appalachia and see

857
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,000
what's there um I'll probably run the

858
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,598
loomus headband APPA appy um because I

859
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,039
was so impressed with the plant that my

860
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:23,519
brother grew last year um I'm also super

861
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:26,719
excited to jump back on the humble's

862
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:29,480
Most Wanted which I grew two years ago

863
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:33,039
didn't grow last year and I'm jonesen

864
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,440
for it this year um it was a one of my

865
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,279
favorite plants grew itself another Girl

866
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,800
Scout cookie hybrid from CSI that is

867
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,240
just does its own thing and provides

868
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,680
really great smoke for me and in my

869
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:49,078
perfect it it perfectly works for my

870
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:51,759
climate um what else am I excited for

871
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,920
next year um yeah the Santa Cru wreck

872
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,160
mixing the the Blue Dream um with the

873
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,119
atws I I'll probably run Category 5

874
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,440
again because uh I liked it a little

875
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,400
more than the Mojo rising and my brother

876
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,240
liked the Mojo Rising more than the Cat

877
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:12,960
5 so I'll probably run a couple cat

878
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:15,838
fives um I definitely am interested in

879
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,519
trying to get the blooper skunk uh up

880
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,719
and running the Gil Blue Bonnet I had

881
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,119
two of them last year but uh both of

882
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,559
them turned out being males super

883
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,358
unfortunate they were both really big

884
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,440
healthy bushy plant and I was looking at

885
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,199
them I was like oh man these end up

886
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,400
being female these are going to be great

887
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:37,960
but a loss both of them were were males

888
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,440
um the blueberry n the riot Berry the

889
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:46,318
blue garri those are all Riot stuff that

890
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,599
really intrigue me and um yeah so the on

891
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:51,679
top of of trying some more riot gear

892
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,559
some more goat farm gear some more CSI

893
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,279
gear um I'm also going to return back to

894
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,719
some of the stuff that I've created um

895
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,119
in 2021 I created a series of pine

896
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:06,838
tarush hybrids and I've played around

897
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,680
with them here and there but friends and

898
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:11,400
and close relatives have grown them more

899
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,759
than I have and I've seen some really

900
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:18,400
really good success in the Living Dead

901
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:22,280
Girl pine tar Kush crosses and the um

902
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,880
the lemon party pine tar Kush so next

903
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,280
this coming year I'm going to be playing

904
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,000
around with some of my own seeds a

905
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,880
little more I'm going to get back into

906
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,559
the the kotg f1s the uh black cherry

907
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,920
soda hybrids that I crossed to the sour

908
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:40,480
diesel white widows um in 2018 I grew a

909
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,000
handful of those and I was just really

910
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,358
happy with everything that came out of

911
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,719
them and I just haven't Revisited it yet

912
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:50,199
because I've been so happy exploring

913
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:53,598
this this plethora of genetics that I've

914
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,639
been thankfully given access to so I'll

915
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,960
do a little little return to Cinder and

916
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:00,960
come back home and pop some of my own

917
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,318
stuff and you know get back into my own

918
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,760
my own genetics which I'm also just as

919
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:09,239
excited

920
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:11,280
about hell yeah um I did I did think of

921
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,000
one prompt I had or question I had for

922
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,839
for peaches um I don't know if she wants

923
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,719
to speak to it though but I wondered if

924
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,078
you might tell us a bit about the early

925
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:23,838
Pearl stuff I know it's kind of like

926
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,359
more on Buck side of the story and we we

927
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,838
even have maybe talked about doing h

928
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:32,159
episode on that but I wonder if you give

929
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:34,119
us like a little you know update on on

930
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,318
that on what the story is

931
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:43,760
there um well

932
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:43,759
uh the early Pearl has been his definite

933
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,358
uh he's been on the search for a while

934
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,039
um last year his white whale yeah yeah

935
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,519
it has been ever since ever since I've

936
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:01,318
met him actually which you know we met

937
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:04,679
at 18 so it's been a long time and uh

938
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:10,440
last year man we had the early Pearl out

939
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:13,399
there we had the silver Pearl um S1 we

940
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:17,480
had Pips perfect Pearl and then we had

941
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:21,200
the Lost Pearl and we also had the hunza

942
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:25,079
valley uh 91 by early Pearl that we had

943
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:27,519
made the year before um cuz you know

944
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,000
he's searching for that that one

945
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,679
phenotype and uh this year actually he

946
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,800
tracked down some uh

947
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:39,039
20-year-old pear uh early Pearl clone

948
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,519
strain and so that's one of the one

949
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,559
that's going to go out on the hill too

950
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,440
um he's really excited about that one

951
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:49,920
cuz he said from what he talked to the

952
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:54,679
guy about it has the smell and the looks

953
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,519
of what he's been searching for um so

954
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,239
you know uh it's gotten to the point

955
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,679
like we've done this so much last year I

956
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,318
told him he couldn't have any of the

957
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:06,000
pots on the hill for early Pearl that I

958
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:08,358
was doing my peach hunt so there is like

959
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,079
I don't even know 20 some plants down

960
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:13,199
here in one gallon pots that he was

961
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,160
searching through last year um we found

962
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:18,639
one male that we kept it's in the uh

963
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:22,558
room back there uh that we're going to

964
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,920
use for breeding and then uh you know

965
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,720
it's just it's he's still on that search

966
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,400
we quite haven't found the one

967
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,159
yet so I don't know if that covered what

968
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,680
you're asking about or if there's yeah

969
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:39,558
know super cool yeah I think the fact

970
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,960
that like he has such such a strong you

971
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:43,760
know affiliation with the that

972
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,199
particular plant in his mind and you

973
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,200
know searching for it it's like it's

974
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:52,118
kind of an epic story it is it's a real

975
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,318
epic story because that you know

976
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:58,440
he's uh the short little story is you

977
00:42:55,318 --> 00:43:02,318
know when he he lost his dad when he was

978
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,599
young and then this guy who mentored him

979
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,880
was really like a father figure to him

980
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,760
and probably one of the only men in his

981
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,280
life that was actually like a decent man

982
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:16,400
to him and wasn't you know an ass and uh

983
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,480
he showed Cass you know all about this

984
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,079
growing and I mean Cass had been growing

985
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,199
before but when he went there this guy

986
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:29,880
was his mentor and he was a good person

987
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:31,838
and as well as a good grower and uh it

988
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,119
was the early Pearl was the strain that

989
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,039
he went and helped him with you know his

990
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,680
wife had cancer at the time and that's

991
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:42,000
why he went over there to help him grow

992
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:44,279
so he could be um you know taking care

993
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,599
of it way took her to chemo and did that

994
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:52,440
stuff and um

995
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:56,519
so that strain was what uh him and his

996
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,800
his uh his name was Stan Harden and his

997
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:03,079
whole thing about this is trying to get

998
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,720
his story told because he was one of

999
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:10,359
those old guys who you know ended up

1000
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:14,679
going to jail and he they let him out to

1001
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:16,639
die basically um and it's just one of

1002
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:19,598
those stories of you know so many that

1003
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:22,719
of us have of our uncles or grandpas

1004
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,680
that the you know the War on Drugs took

1005
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,118
people from us that should have never

1006
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,279
been taken and so that strain means a

1007
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,240
lot to him and that's why we've done a

1008
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,559
lot to try to bring it back and try to

1009
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:37,279
find you know that exact one it's just

1010
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,640
been really

1011
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,319
hard these uh stories like that are like

1012
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,000
Keystone like moments for a lot of the

1013
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:49,000
Cannabis Community it's some of my

1014
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,639
favorite um uh some of my favorite stuff

1015
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,280
in the community is hearing people who

1016
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,279
have been chasing this strain for x

1017
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,880
amount of years or they they're trying

1018
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,440
to get back to it because it meant so

1019
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,800
much to them it's it's really cool to

1020
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,240
see people in the community that that

1021
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,079
have that gumption to to chase after

1022
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:10,439
something like

1023
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,760
that yeah I mean it's it's taken you

1024
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,559
know well you guys know like seed pack

1025
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,440
we've probably gone through I don't know

1026
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,880
20 plus seed packs over the last few

1027
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,559
years um just trying to find that one

1028
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,039
and we still haven't found it so now

1029
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,720
we're switching to the trying to you

1030
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:31,318
know breed with it and you know got the

1031
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:34,318
mail and try to you know bring it back

1032
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:36,239
and bring some bger back to it he right

1033
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,159
you know feels like it's really kind of

1034
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,199
lost what it had back then and you know

1035
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:42,759
there's a whole really neat story to it

1036
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,919
all I don't want to tell it all right

1037
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,880
now cuz I know uh he wants to do an

1038
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,480
episode on it but like it it did that

1039
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,079
strain specifically well that pheno of

1040
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,639
the early Pearl I should say it was a

1041
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:59,000
pheno um did make it out to like the

1042
00:45:55,639 --> 00:46:01,199
Great Grateful Dead um Cypress Hill

1043
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,800
digital peoples I mean there was a whole

1044
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,279
little thing that happened with that

1045
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,480
strain

1046
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,920
um that that would just be neat to have

1047
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,440
that story told and it would be really

1048
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,119
neat for him to actually find it so

1049
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,838
hopefully one day we can get

1050
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,960
there yeah it's epic and yes we will

1051
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,838
hopefully have uh an actual show on

1052
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,358
this maybe actually it's like a maybe

1053
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,920
it'll be a good time to do it like

1054
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,679
either before the next season starts or

1055
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,838
a partway through or something yeah

1056
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,159
we'll see yeah but thanks for sharing

1057
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,159
that really cool yeah of

1058
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:45,558
course kush yeah what what else we um uh

1059
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,199
other than that yeah I think I think

1060
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,599
that wraps up most of what we were

1061
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:52,480
talking about um I know that we could we

1062
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,200
could talk a little bit about um the

1063
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,280
future of the outdoor round table and

1064
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:01,639
where it's going to go for 2024 tell us

1065
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:04,800
yeah tell us about your ideas so mostly

1066
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:06,480
my idea is basically a framework replica

1067
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,720
of what we did last year we're going to

1068
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,639
check in every month or every couple of

1069
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:14,239
months about what we're doing in the

1070
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:17,159
garden if anything's new updating with

1071
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:19,118
our outdoor grows but also sprinkled in

1072
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,118
I'm going to start to try and do some

1073
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,119
interviews um I over the years through

1074
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,960
Instagram through IC mag forums through

1075
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:31,280
people I've met and in the valley um all

1076
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,440
over Northern California uh I'm I plan

1077
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,319
on doing interviews uh with with these

1078
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,039
select people and and just sitting down

1079
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,239
and having a a onetoone conversation and

1080
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,400
and getting to know some of these

1081
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:45,679
outdoor Growers much like myself a lot

1082
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,960
of us are recluse uh and and we don't we

1083
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,440
wouldn't without being prodded or poked

1084
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,838
we wouldn't have jumped into the

1085
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,800
community and started talking and and

1086
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:57,239
making ourselves more known and I I know

1087
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,000
tons of cats like this um um I got five

1088
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:02,279
or six guys off the top of my head uh

1089
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,159
and women both guys and girls that that

1090
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,800
I I want to interview and I want to have

1091
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,558
discussions with and they're all uh

1092
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,318
they're all great outdoor Growers and

1093
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:14,599
great minds for for what they're doing

1094
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,639
in their own respective rights and I

1095
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,800
think that more more people should have

1096
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,039
discussions with them uh a lot of these

1097
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,000
people I've spent a lot of time uh

1098
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:26,239
sending paragraphs back and forth

1099
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,599
talking about weed and talking about

1100
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:32,279
life but haven't sat down and done a an

1101
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,838
actual voice conversation like this and

1102
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,920
I think I think uh I think people need

1103
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:38,880
to need to be exposed to to the

1104
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,838
different shades of of Growers that we

1105
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,960
have out there um almost no two outdoor

1106
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:47,719
Growers are alike it's it's a very

1107
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,679
unique community that I I've ran into so

1108
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,199
far and I'm I'm excited to to talk to

1109
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,838
him and sprinkle in some of those

1110
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,719

00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:54,359
grow um yeah I'm I'm happy to chat as as

1135
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,240
the season moves forward to to uh talk

1136
00:49:54,358 --> 00:50:00,000
about what's going on and and what

1137
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:02,399
issues are arising and and uh kind of

1138
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,880
The Season's a marathon so it's funny to

1139
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,240
check it's it's fun to check in right

1140
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,480
and see how everybody's doing and how

1141
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:12,358
they're dealing with with different

1142
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,719
things so right on guys I think to me

1143
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:15,279
that is a really nice thing about

1144
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,118
outdoor at least you know living in this

1145
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,440
in a similar region anyway where you

1146
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,680
guys are actually in Pace with each

1147
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,200
other sort of um and kind of check in

1148
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,598
whereas you know if you're indoor grower

1149
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,358
like it doesn't really matter you don't

1150
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,680
have that kind of um seasonal

1151
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:32,358
progression I guess

1152
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,279
um yeah yeah there's there's a couple

1153
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:35,838
major keystones is like you know going

1154
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,440
Outdoors when everybody and then when it

1155
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:40,838
flips into flower we're all not on the

1156
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,119
exact same schedule but we're all tuned

1157
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:45,358
into the same you know we're we're we're

1158
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,599
right on par with each other I never

1159
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,519
thought about it that way compared to to

1160
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,680
indoor you know guys who are modulating

1161
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:54,880
their own

1162
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:58,679
schedules no I love it it's like a set

1163
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,880
of um rituals or something right well

1164
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,318
yeah I feel like my outdoor Garden the

1165
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,000
more I do it it turns into a ritual it's

1166
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:08,199
it's become a meditative process for me

1167
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,480
it's like uh it's like unconscious

1168
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:14,439
meditation just going down hanging out

1169
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,240
with the plants you know cutting a few

1170
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,599

1172
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,760
it's it's basically a part of my life

1173
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,358
and it's it's like like you know

1174
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,000
meditation to me

trophy you can get again same I'll get

1221
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:35,480
in his ear for sure um because I always

1222
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:39,078
those are my favorite episodes when he's

1223
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,760
talking or a couple other folks uh but

1224
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:43,920
uh cause man yeah he talks to Matt quite

1225
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,880
a bit and Matt says that you know he he

1226
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,000
tries to be like polite because he's a

1227
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,318
friend and he doesn't want to pressure

1228
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,079
him too much but I'm like why don't you

1229
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:54,159
just pressure him oh I'll pressure him

1230

1231
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,159
