so

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,280
we are gonna chat today

57
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,919
about a pretty wide topic but people

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,479
have been asking a lot about it um which

59
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,238
is sort of like the the whole like hash

60
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,079
plant topic

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,159
right because it's meant different

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
things at different times

63
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,439
and there's a lot of old famous hash

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,239
plants

65
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,239
yeah

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
and there's a lot of breeding that got

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,599
bred into those

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
um and then there's a lot of new modern

69
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,439
ones yeah a new modern

70
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,000
plants for hash

71
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,439
yeah i mean not only not and by modern i

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
mean like even like

73
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,120
you know there was a whole new round of

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
named cuts

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,719
that oh yeah they got you know hash

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,439
plant labels or yeah different things

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,280
and now hash plan actually means

78
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,560
you know something totally different

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,239
sure it does you know um so yeah we're

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
gonna kind of talk widely about hash

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
plants so if you ever have any hash

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
blank questions or anything along those

83
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,559
lines uh today is a great day to shoot

84
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,840
them

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,280
uh and see what's up i got all the i got

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,400
all the catalogs ready i've got

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,598
illustrations ready of said hash plants

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,719
most of them

89
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,839
and i even went back and um

90
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,120
because there was one hash plan i

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,400
thought of that nobody ever really

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,360
mentions anymore but for a while in the

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,519
like the 0809 era it was pretty popular

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
and that was the cuttlefish so i even

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,840
dug up info on the old cuttlefish plant

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,879
the old cuttlefish so yeah we're going

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,560
to go over as many as we can remember

98
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,359
as many as we can so yeah we're going to

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,479
talk about the history of hash plant

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
we're going to talk about a bunch of

101
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,318
specific cuts

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
people can ask away about specific cuts

103
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,598
they're interested in like like matt

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,519
just said he's got a list

105
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,560
um but like maybe uh um the term hash

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,399
plant

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,358
you know just to start

108
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,039
right is kind of a weird term

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,638
uh because

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,000
uh all afghans back then

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,400
pretty much bred and grown for hash yes

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
but then some strains got called hash

113
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,839
plant and some strains got called other

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,439
names

115
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,758
and do we know that was neville the

116
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,000
first one to name a strain or did it

117
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
come over that way with that name and

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
then he used the name

119
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,918
i mean i don't know you know the only

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,720
thing that we know about like the g13

121
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,399
and the uh pnw hash plant

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
is that neville says he bought him an

123
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,560
organ through friends of jorge cervantes

124
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
yeah yeah

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,680
and jorge confirmed that you know yeah

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
um but we don't know the origin stories

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,439
so i assume he just called it what he

128
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,758
got it it was a hash plan

129
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,079
yeah i i assume so too i don't know

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
where it where the name evolved would be

131
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,680
nice to ask jorge but i don't know if he

132
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,758
would know but it's weird because it's

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,519
like essentially like hash plants

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,439
started off as basically being any

135
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,000
any afghan

136
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,279
yes because they were all that's what

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
that's what

138
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,599
you know marijuana was grown for yeah

139
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
was to make hatch

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,800
and so people started bringing over all

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,639
these afghans or hash plants or whatever

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
all these various different things over

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,800
to america and you know we talked about

144
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,159
this a bunch but crossing them with a

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,319
bunch of different sativas yeah

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,919
right yep

147
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,759
is is kind of that's kind of that's kind

148
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,560
of the beginning of it

149
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,919
right

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,600
yes so here's this is

151
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,439
i could probably jump the gun on showing

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
this one actually let's go ahead quick i

153
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,120
mean that's not it's not terribly

154
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
jumping the gun so what happened is is

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,478
that a bunch of people started bringing

156
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,399
over these afghans because they wanted

157
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,519
to add bigger chunkier buds to their

158
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,279
sativas

159
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,918
and they wanted their sativas to finish

160
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,839
earlier right yeah so

161
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,000
um afghanistan is a super different

162
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,918
climate than over here so most of these

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,038
hash plants or afghans that they brought

164
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,159
over they just rot it yeah

165
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,399
they just they just read in terrible rot

166
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,479
uh so the vast majority

167
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,038
of the seeds that people brought over

168
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,839
ended up being not that useful

169
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,478
yeah like people would go and get their

170
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,918
seeds from before they bred that indica

171
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,318
into it

172
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,519
right and so there so early on

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,680
um early on the big hunt for hash plants

174
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,519
or the big hunt for

175
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,319
afghans was ones that didn't rot

176
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,799
yeah

177
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,240
and that's kind of why i think some of

178
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
these cuttings

179
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,639
became so popular

180
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,159
like you know because most you know most

181
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
of the breeding that got done just got

182
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,039
done with specific moms

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,080
yeah because once you found one that did

184
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,478
that you traded it

185
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,639
right yep that's how they did over there

186
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,038
that's how they did it so so there's an

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
aspect where it's like neville went and

188
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,719
you know neville even said that like

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,759
because matt held up his his catalog or

190
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
whatever

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,800
all that hunting that neville did in

192
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,120
afghanistan he said regrettably like

193
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,960
those those afghans weren't as nice as

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,519
some of the clone only's he got sent

195
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,318
over from america yeah whether that was

196
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,879
big bud or the pacific northwest hash

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,360
plant or the g13 or

198
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,680
you know um some of the cuttings that he

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,520
got and so these cuttings that did well

200
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
you know the nl5 all these different

201
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,839
things start getting passed around yeah

202
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,598
because they work

203
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,279
right and so neville probably would met

204
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,878
with matt just held up neville probably

205
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,719
made it really famous

206
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,599
this is the hash plant pure

207
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,599
by

208
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,719
he crossed the hash plant to like the

209
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,918
g13 and the and the nl1

210
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,319
and he and then he took a g13 nl1 and he

211
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,758
back crossed it to the hash plan again

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
and that's what matt was showing that

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,240
ugly squat thing hash plant pure yeah

214
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,240
this is the hash hashtag here which i

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,439
mean you know there is debate on whether

216
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,560
the pnw hash plant that exists today is

217
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,439
this

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,038
but looking at this and granted

219
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,439
you know different growing environments

220
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,279
everything else i i would be

221
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,719
hard-pressed to say this looks anything

222
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,439
like the the cut indoors grown here

223
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
uh of the pnw it doesn't know it looks

224
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
like

225
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,120
though it sure does look puckish

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,519
like i wouldn't say it looks like the

227
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,278
the hash plant cut that gets passed

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,320
around either but boy does it look like

229
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,799
some ugly puck it sure does it's bud

230
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
formation and and all that type of stuff

231
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,879
and so what's weird maybe i should say

232
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,359
this before we move on what's weird

233
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,320
about what we did right

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
is

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
um

236
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,278
someone just asked so afghan is hash

237
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:06,239
plant now the afghan people grew

238
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,639
afghans to make into hashish

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
yes you know they that they made hash

240
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,120
they still make hash they don't smoke

241
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
flour so they never called it hash

242
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
plants

243
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,278
yeah right like it was it was just a

244
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,039
term that got put onto afghans and then

245
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,480
people think it made it meant something

246
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,120
specific

247
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,639
but all afghan and pakistani stuff

248
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
that's what they did

249
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,439
with their plants yeah you make hash

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,559
you know

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
and so

252
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,599
um you know and so there's an aspect

253
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,519
where we brought all these plants over

254
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,879
to america

255
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
okay and started [ __ ] with them

256
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,039
whether they're steve murphy's afghan

257
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,600
that started the nl thing or the

258
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,838
you know or the the pacific northwest

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,240
hash plan or the big bud story or

260
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,000
whatever but we weren't using them for

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
hash plants

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,879
we weren't growing fields like they were

263
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,039
and doing anything that they were doing

264
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,879
yeah right so what we did we were

265
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,639
looking for them to blend well with our

266
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,480
sativas

267
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,759
yeah right now that's a trip right

268
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
because that means that right when they

269
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,319
got to america a completely different

270
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,959
set of selection pressures got put into

271
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,120
play yeah they're yeah i mean they were

272
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,799
they were selecting and for breeding

273
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
they came over here they had been

274
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,399
selected to work well in the afghanistan

275
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,839
environment

276
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,600
to make to make those people hash

277
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
and we brought it over here and tried to

278
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,320
blend it with our favorite weed to get

279
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,639
good weed to smoke

280
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,959
right and and to finish early indoors

281
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,480
sure yeah but i mean

282
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,679
all these different like they weren't

283
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
trying to they weren't there was no

284
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,120
indoor

285
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,240
i mean we used afghans for indoor when

286
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,240
they came over yeah but no they from

287
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,919
afghanistan or pakistan or that region

288
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,759
they were always growing outside oh yeah

289
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,838
yeah they weren't blowing up houses in

290
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,519
that no and they didn't they came from a

291
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
cold dry environment so they weren't

292
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,200
worried about the mold i'm just saying

293
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:04,078
that like all of the farmers looking for

294
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,200
for you know uh you know genetics you

295
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,919
know various aspects that um benefit an

296
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,480
afghanistan farmer was much different

297
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,879
than a washington oregon california

298
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
indoor or outdoor grower trying to [ __ ]

299
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,559
with some mexicans

300
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
and some colombians and some panamanians

301
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,119
and some thai and blend this afghan into

302
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,200
that and get what they've got

303
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,799
we had a way different set of selection

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
pressure and we didn't really make hash

305
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,879
for a long time except for for private

306
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
yeah

307
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,200
right

308
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
yep

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,278
so

310
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,519
you know um but we liked they were short

311
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,120
they were squat um they were they had a

312
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,078
bunch of crystal

313
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,480
you know we're visual creatures too

314
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,799
so frosty looking nugs

315
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
work better for americans

316
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,000
you know and so what were the what were

317
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,360
the famous what are the famous earliest

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
hash plans

319
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,759
so the early ones i mean as far as the

320
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,329
earliest we're going to go you know like

321
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,439
uh

322
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,440
[Music]

323
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,759
i mean the pnw

324
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,278
there weren't a lot of early early

325
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,120
hashpoints but some of the the ones

326
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,879
early in the scene would be like you

327
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
know there was the seed bay cash plant

328
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,759
which would be

329
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
their hash plant pure which would be

330
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,600
different from

331
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,839
you know the g13 or the the hash plant

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,959
nl1 which was using the g13 hash plant

333
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
nl1

334
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,039
we have the puck

335
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,720
of course aka skelly we have the

336
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,039
cuttlefish hash plant

337
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,720
uh bce hash plant there was also a

338
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,958
champagne hash plant which i'm not sure

339
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
if is different from the bc hash plant

340
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,958
maybe some of the canadian folks will

341
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,479
know uh we have hash plant 13. um yeah

342
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,638
and some of these some of these aren't

343
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,759
even necessarily from the hash plant

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,839
family

345
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,759
of strains that came from neville you

346
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,399
know some of these were just called hash

347
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,879
plant because of whatever reason it

348
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,799
became a bit hash plan is a bit like

349
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,600
kush

350
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,879
in that it's a general term that applies

351
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,120
to a wide variety of things yeah

352
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,799
you know and why one thing was all

353
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
labeled kush and another thing was

354
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,958
labeled hash plant when the kush was

355
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,639
destined to be made into hash

356
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,239
yeah it's just one of those language

357
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
things that happened

358
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
yeah and then there's there is some

359
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,958
confusion uh i guess we can go into

360
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,560
individual ones in a little bit so if

361
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,239
you want to continue

362
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,159
i don't want to jump it

363
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,600
no i mean so that's basically like and

364
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,240
then it became famous because in the 80s

365
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,879
as as he just showed uh neville started

366
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,600
calling things hash plan and there was

367
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,679
famous hash plant hybrids

368
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
you know and mostly americans used it

369
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,719
because it was a short squat decent

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,159
yielding frosty plant inside yeah we

371
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
weren't you know nobody was really

372
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,198
making hash in america we smoke flour

373
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,759
mostly

374
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:55,039
yeah okay champagne was different from

375
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,240
the bc very interesting

376
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,278
good to know

377
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,720
and it's actually interesting maybe if

378
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,000
you were gonna jump around but i'm gonna

379
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,079
really jump around to like today okay so

380
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,919
when when we first brought over all

381
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,239
these hash plants they were brought over

382
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,000
and they had been bred to be excellent

383
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,839
hash plants yeah right and people like

384
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,278
people in europe and and in the know and

385
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,800
you know sammy and stuff have told me

386
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,639
that they feel like a lot of modern

387
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,319
cultivars like are really shitty hash

388
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
plants yeah that a lot of the

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,440
traditional ones that were bred for that

390
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,720
specifically and bred for resin

391
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,920
are much better plants for that yeah

392
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
because they were never bred for

393
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,319
anything else yeah and now with the

394
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,759
legalization and all that and the hash

395
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
revolution that's happened with all

396
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,919
these various elements and dabs and

397
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
everything we're actually like looking

398
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,479
people talk about dumpers yeah right

399
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
they talk about hash yield a lot in

400
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,199
various ways and methods and so figuring

401
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,799
out what plants are good hash plants is

402
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,278
like back in vogue

403
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,078
yeah kind of for the first time ever

404
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,000
yeah

405
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,919
like on any kind of like commercial

406
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
scale people have been making hash here

407
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,479
privately to share with their friends

408
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,639
forever yeah but as far as like uh like

409
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,959
a major thing it's probably it's pretty

410
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,120
recent last 20 years probably yeah

411
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,958
easily and now with testing and people

412
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,879
can be like oh this thing washes six

413
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,078
percent or this thing washes this people

414
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,320
start hunting for hash plant yields

415
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,638
yeah and and what is a good washer what

416
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,160
what keeps its flavor

417
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:29,039
but we went 40 [ __ ] years

418
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,120
without those pressures being applied

419
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,958
this is this is a good input from

420
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,198
archive he said dumpers are mainly just

421
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,958
plants with higher than average thc to

422
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,319
terp ratio

423
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,799
yeah that's good

424
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
good info so you know so there's an

425
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,479
aspect where it's like for a long time

426
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,079
from what most people is hash plants

427
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
came over here and got mixed with other

428
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,319
weed

429
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,919
you know for breeding purposes

430
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
you know because like if you look at the

431
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,679
puck or you look at that picture you

432
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,000
know some of those things were short

433
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,958
squat ugly

434
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,879
you know they weren't the most

435
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,838
attractive things always

436
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,919
yeah even even chem 91 uh you know aside

437
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,000
from hash plants cam 91 is another

438
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,159
afghani not necessarily known for its

439
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
beautiful qualities same kind of way

440
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,000
yeah same kind of way

441
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,880
yeah so but they started becoming famous

442
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,958
because he put him in the first catalog

443
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,159
yeah and so there was hash plants and

444
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,479
then you know like he was saying the

445
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,159
skelly there's some that survive from

446
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,079
back then that became got really well

447
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,958
known yeah

448
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,078
um but they're not related

449
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,758
to no

450
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,758
not not a lot

451
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
just you someone's asking me to show the

452
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,399
uh hash plant pure again so i'm going to

453
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,399
show that again

454
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,198
there we go

455
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,919
so the hash plant pure neville took the

456
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,799
hash plant clone only he got from oregon

457
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,039
and he crossed it to a male nl1

458
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,958
and then he took a male of that hybrid

459
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,240
and crossed it back

460
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,078
to the

461
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,159
to the hash plant

462
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,758
and that was his hash plant pure yeah

463
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,360
and that's honestly kind of like what he

464
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,120
did with a number of things like when he

465
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,959
offered his hawaiian indica

466
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,519
um there's a number of things where he

467
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,000
crossed it once to nl1

468
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,000
and then crossed a male of that hybrid

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
back to itself and just released it as a

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,838
pure line yeah that was actually a

471
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,838
reasonably common tactic

472
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,120
yeah

473
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,119
it does appear that neville got the hash

474
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,959
plant and the g13 on the same trip at

475
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,079
the same time from the same people even

476
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,880
how would you have liked to have been

477
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,319
able to grab a pack of that the original

478
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,200
afghan mix

479
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,399
neville sold uh neville sold

480
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,798
seeds that uh jim ortega had given him

481
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,480
yeah he got so many that he he offered

482
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,960
up the same seeds that he found all of

483
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,360
the maple leaf stuff in he sold for a

484
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,038
couple of years as just 50 pack 50 pack

485
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,159
breeder packs and 150 bucks

486
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,279
yeah

487
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
yeah

488
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,160
unreal

489
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,079
neville was cool in that sense and that

490
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,320
he pretty much just told you what he was

491
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,599
crossing there was no real secrecy

492
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,038
behind it

493
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,038
you know but he was also first

494
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,839
so he didn't have to hide anything

495
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,079
yeah

496
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,119
that helps

497
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,119
um

498
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,879
but yeah you know the these hash plans

499
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,519
some of these hash plants have gotten

500
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,559
famous it's very likely that the scout

501
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,480
the puck

502
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,519
is a direct descendant of that picture

503
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,519
matt

504
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,599
you know that's the rumor at least that

505
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,119
it seeds from then

506
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,319
and then uh

507
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,359
um our buddy body has a pretty famous

508
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,119
uh lot number of lines out that him and

509
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,959
other people have used matt got some of

510
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,759
those from ndn guy

511
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,519
yeah uh the g13 hash plant which was

512
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,798
1988

513
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,319
the 88

514
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,918
yeah that's i mean that's that's kind of

515
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,720
how they how they type it or whatever

516
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,799
but

517
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
um it's basically supposed to be from

518
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,918
the first year that neville released the

519
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,120
g13

520
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,720
hash plant hybrid yeah yeah

521
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,359
right yeah

522
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,440
i mean i i who knows what what they were

523
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,038
really from or what year or which seed

524
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
bank or any of that but that was the

525
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,960
story given with them

526
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:13,599
1988 cincy seeds plant was or g13 hash

527
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,319
plant which was what they said

528
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,639
so whatever it is i mean it's it it that

529
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,399
exists and so a lot of people have that

530
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
and people have puck hybrids and some

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
people still have the puck clone yeah

532
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,759
you know and so there's some old hash

533
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,720
plants that exist but

534
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,960
um

535
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,839
you can kind of can like and then there

536
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,679
was kind of like another wave

537
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,798
where people started kept using the

538
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,440
nickname

539
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:42,240
yes but it was all grown for flower yeah

540
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,759
in my opinion nobody was really making

541
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,079
nobody was really using it the way they

542
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,480
used it in afghanistan

543
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,839
no not not in the us

544
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,880
not in the u.s so

545
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,159
um but yeah there was there was

546
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,919
something uh puck is the hash plan

547
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,720
you know they they or they think it is

548
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,840
that's what it's i mean it looks

549
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,360
like traditional hash plant and hash

550
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,759
plant strain

551
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,359
um like in that picture it does have a

552
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,079
lot of those similar traits it does have

553
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,359
a lot of similar traits you know yeah um

554
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,279
and it's out there in the community and

555
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,399
stuff like that people breed with it

556
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,918
so

557
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,280
you know at the very least it ties back

558
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,759
to something old

559
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,000
yeah but that's most basically what they

560
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,279
were doing is is in america we were

561
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,319
looking for like

562
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,158
um

563
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,918
hash plants and afghans that we could

564
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
cross to other things and would bring

565
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,480
the flowering time and the height

566
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,159
and add some crystal and some density

567
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,960
um but uh but teeth but keep a lot of

568
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,720
the other qualities from the sativa yeah

569
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,279
those were sort of the first blends that

570
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,600
people were after was

571
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,279
structurally what the hash plant did

572
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,439
yeah and the flavors of the sativa and

573
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,440
the high and the but the flavor and the

574
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,038
smoke and the stretch

575
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,080
you know yeah

576
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,319
so

577
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,319
um you know it it's one of those it's

578
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,918
one of those aspects where we put a

579
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,960
bunch of different selection pressures

580
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,960
on it but kept the name

581
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
see we got here so one of the ones often

582
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,039
mentioned is the cuttlefish you know

583
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,360
like or not often mentioned i should say

584
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,240
um but in the in the

585
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,079
like late 2000s it was used a lot by sub

586
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,079
cools crew and

587
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,839
um best i could tell i remember talking

588
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,599
to jill about about it

589
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,759
came from bad boy

590
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,678
whoever that was one of their buddies

591
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,519
and it was actually a super skunk cross

592
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,759
to skunk

593
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,400
uh skunk one and it was like a fruity

594
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,640
they say skunky fruity i'm not sure

595
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,320
on all that but yeah that was what the

596
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
cuttlefish hash plant was it wasn't even

597
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,439
a scentsy hash plant or seed bank cash

598
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,960
plant um it was a super skunk skunked

599
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,038
one

600
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,679
so we we had a bunch of people that were

601
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,679
just asking about the g13

602
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,960
so we could focus on that for a minute

603
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,480
hey fletch you want to come on and talk

604
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,480
to you 13 you're from that area

605
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
so like i said before one part of the

606
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,079
story is that

607
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,559
neville said on one of his american

608
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,759
trips uh he bought the g13 and the hash

609
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,960
palace clone yeah uh from somebody

610
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,440
there he is

611
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,679
what's up fletch hey what's up guys how

612
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,000
you doing buddy good earning good to see

613
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,000
you dude good to see you yep what's

614
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
going on

615
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,880
just hash plan

616
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,038
the old northwest favorites i mean i

617
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,879
think something that people forget

618
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,759
is that um

619
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,360
the northwest specifically uh like

620
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,000
washington state

621
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,599
is where hid lighting company came from

622
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,599
it's where some of the first hydroponics

623
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,000
companies came from that like the early

624
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,839
80s this was the spot to grow weed

625
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,599
because

626
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,000
the climate

627
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,199
is really good for having heat inside

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,400
your house generally all year

629
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
everybody's always like oh the

630
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,480
humidity's so high up there well

631
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,640
if you know anything about

632
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,519
you know relative humidity

633
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,120
air that's 45 degrees and 80 percent

634
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,440
humidity

635
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,359
and you bring that into like a 75 degree

636
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,038
grow room and hit it with all that heat

637
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,519
from all your equipment

638
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,519
makes a perfect climate 40 feet a day

639
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,038
humidity so

640
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,519
you always hear people oh there's mold

641
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,240
or powdery mildew i mean i i know tons

642
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,038
of growers from up here and powdery

643
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,599
mildew never existed in anyone's garden

644
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,400
until clones started coming up from yeah

645
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,119
specifically from ed rosenthal's

646
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,919
um operation in the you know early late

647
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,599
90s early 2000s with yeah the other

648
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,960
lady's name that was running it but they

649
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,519
would like i mean they spread that [ __ ]

650
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,440
worldwide

651
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,759
that's what you want to be known for

652
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,960
you know centralized clone selling is

653
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,158
really what has spread most problems

654
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,240
everywhere

655
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,360
absolutely the dudding the you know the

656
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,200
the viroids the powdery mildews bugs all

657
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,719
these various different types of things

658
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,319
when people were just getting clones

659
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,839
from their buddy or a small group of

660
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,918
friends it kept most problems localized

661
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,599
yeah and it's when people start stop

662
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,759
maintaining their own mothers and will

663
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,199
just like oh i'll [ __ ] buy 200 cuts

664
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,400
for my next run

665
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
and started getting them from

666
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,840
dispensaries and getting them from these

667
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,400
centralized places

668
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,519
that's kind of when all these issues

669
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,600
um

670
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,319
started spreading like crazy

671
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,038
was because they'd get into a a poorly

672
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,960
run ed rosenthal situation or they'd get

673
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,720
into a dark heart or whatever and then

674
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,840
they would just sell to thousands of

675
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,319
people

676
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,000
exactly well let's talk to g13

677
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,918
so you know what you know

678
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
so he probably knows but i will i will

679
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,038
say one more thing and then i'll shut up

680
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,119
is that

681
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,599
um you know neville says that he got it

682
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,079
on this trip and jorge confirmed it when

683
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,759
we interviewed uh

684
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:53,119
jorgensen right

685
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,759
that was like the one tidbit that we got

686
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,839
was he remember he said that the g13 was

687
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,158
actually called

688
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,158
um

689
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,679
yeah the uw that's what his statement

690
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,000
was uh that was like literally an hour

691
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,880
and a half of of talking that was the

692
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,038
one

693
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,440
piece of weed history that he casually

694
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,038
mentioned that like was was

695
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
any but you know it seems like it was

696
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,158
one of those

697
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,678
like like fletch was saying it was one

698
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,278
of those things where

699
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,960
they were collecting different clones

700
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:23,759
that worked good indoors and trading

701
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
them

702
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,079
yeah

703
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,880
right

704
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:31,278
even up here people were really

705
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
um reserved about sharing any kind of

706
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,079
clones um

707
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,558
that was true you know probably up until

708
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,879
medical changed in like 2008 with

709
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,278
obama's um

710
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,480
whatever that that uh announcement was

711
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:45,679
where everybody basically started

712
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,038
growing weed because it said the feds

713
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,960
weren't gonna [ __ ] with you anymore if

714
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,480
you were yeah yeah paws

715
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,038
so before that getting clones was hard i

716
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,798
mean people you know everybody just if

717
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,240
you had weave you never told anybody

718
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:58,960
where it came from

719
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,558
so

720
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,240
even if it was from your garden i mean

721
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,158
there's plenty of people you'd buy wheat

722
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,319
from you never knew they grew weed um

723
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
yeah for sure they they just said their

724
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,439
uncle got it or whoever

725
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,919
yeah and um

726
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,080
so but the the g so what what were we

727
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,520
talking about g13 or what you want g13

728
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:23,359
let's do g13 udub stuff like that

729
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:25,359
um so uw and well g13 as far as i know

730
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,879
there's two there's historically only

731
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,519
two clones

732
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,919
yeah

733
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,158
airborne which is from ohio

734
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,038
and then there's pacific which is from

735
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,480
out here like west seattle yeah

736
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,519
um

737
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,120
the pacific was named pacific because of

738
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,319
the user

739
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,038
pacific on cannabis world yeah

740
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:50,558
she he i can't remember she was she was

741
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,759
like in some band or and i can't she was

742
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:52,720
some kind of

743
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,440
you know

744
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,558
modern [ __ ] of some sort yeah back then

745
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,840
but

746
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,759
um

747
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,678
she had two different clones i think

748
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,519
that's how she like to be

749
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,159
referred to and uh it was the

750
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,918
u-dub purple or i think didn't she call

751
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
it uw purple map

752
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,038
yeah you dub black or purple i don't

753
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,278
know people call it uw black now he said

754
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,480
[ __ ] that people made up out of nowhere

755
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,440
yeah

756
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
the

757
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,919
the uw purple i think was and i think

758
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,679
she would sometimes call it purple g13

759
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,278
up here but

760
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,759
like

761
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,278
having been around here for a long time

762
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,558
um

763
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,159
i never saw

764
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,879
the the uw purple or purple that she had

765
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,360
yeah

766
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,480
is the same as the purple indica tacoma

767
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,558
perp

768
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
family of plants that's well known up

769
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,038
here in washington which is like how me

770
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,600
and caleb ended up becoming friends 20

771
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,519
years ago is because he had the oracle i

772
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,079
had the pi from up here

773
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,558
we knew those were families of plants

774
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,879
that were localized to our areas

775
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,319
and um we were trying to figure out hey

776
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,559
are these things related are they

777
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,960
similar and me personally having now

778
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,480
worked with the purple indica a lot and

779
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,919
knowing its history up here i mean it

780
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,599
wasn't even called purple indica when i

781
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,600
got it up here it was just

782
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,398
an unknown clone that i received and i

783
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,240
was just able to identify it as a plant

784
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,879
from

785
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,960
that family of purples yeah yeah caleb

786
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,840
and i we got this other clone that we

787
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,399
call the tacoma perp that came from uh

788
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,519
user stony puff and stuff on yeah yeah

789
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,599
this world

790
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,798
and that was a different clone but the

791
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:38,158
same family of plants i also had pop bag

792
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,639
seeds in like 2002 of that from those

793
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,720
bags of that same weed i got

794
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:48,240
plants they were all almost identical to

795
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,240
you could have passed any of them off as

796
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,278
any of the purple weed that comes around

797
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,278
up here

798
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,558
yeah and uh

799
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,398
that was kind of that's kind of the same

800
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,319
with urkel you know it's like you've got

801
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,359
urkel

802
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,240
um

803
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,000
great

804
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,120
all that [ __ ] 71 whatever yeah yeah 20

805
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,038
different versions of the same

806
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:13,199
essentially genotype of expression yeah

807
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,640
like phenotype within a population or

808
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,038
whatever yeah

809
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
so um

810
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,798
and and it's hard to say whether the

811
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,720
chicken or the egg came for right yeah

812
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,558
did the oracle come first or did it gdp

813
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
which one came from which one and unless

814
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,519
you have

815
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,798
let's get district of it it's pretty

816
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,398
proud so

817
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,759
the g13s the airborne g13

818
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,038
um

819
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,398
that

820
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,879
i've seen

821
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,319
is probably most definitely related to

822
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,799
the lemon g

823
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,918
aka lemon g13 that was all as it was

824
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,240
also called

825
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,240
okay both carry this trait and it's also

826
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,399
a um

827
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,599
i think it's a virus that transfers from

828
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,319
it through seed from parent right

829
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,839
i don't have the actual data to support

830
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,918
exactly that

831
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,359
but for example the lemon peel that i

832
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,759
have is

833
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:13,439
crossed with i9 that has a

834
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,480
rap or virus we have tested for that

835
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,558
right

836
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,558
it's had it basically

837
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,000
i mean like after the second run from

838
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:24,240
clone

839
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,319
it had it and i've never um

840
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,159
i it doesn't transfer to any other

841
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,519
strains at all

842
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,080
except for

843
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:36,798
lemon g hybrids

844
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:39,678
weird p13 so that is really weird and so

845
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:42,079
does the lemon g itself

846
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,440
what kind of virus is it do you know rap

847
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,079
or virus

848
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,120
what is it i'm sorry raspberry dwarf

849
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,558
virus

850
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,959
interesting

851
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:55,119
never even heard that so um

852
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,360
anyways my point is simply that there

853
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,518
can even be you know stuff like that

854
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,719
that can show you

855
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
um

856
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,880
potentially a genetic relation

857
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,839
yeah for sure

858
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,320
um

859
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,798
but i mean we've never sold pure lemon

860
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,918
peel hybrids you know for this yeah

861
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,440
yeah

862
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,278
that's wild um i i think i think uh the

863
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
the airborne is the one that pip showed

864
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,919
us not so the one that he was keeping

865
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,240
his g13 that he called ohio g13

866
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,000
and i think he had a similar theory that

867
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,839
it was related to the lemon g well he

868
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,319
had the limit i mean he he rocked the

869
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,079
lemon g like he monopropped it in that

870
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,599
region for years too he was really

871
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,000
familiar with it

872
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,839
um and i will say that you know one

873
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,759
thing about the pacific that makes me

874
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,558
think that it's probably old is that it

875
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,398
is really ugly

876
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,879
you know it's not a pretty plant in my

877
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,759
opinion which one the the pacific you

878
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,679
know

879
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,440
you know like or pips ver like the g

880
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,919
like i mean that's kind of like one of

881
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,759
its things right was like the g13 was

882
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,000
like when when neville would chat about

883
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,398
it like you know he said it was uh it

884
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,839
was kind of ugly but it had crazy

885
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,000
you know it added it added a bunch of

886
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,319
potency and a bunch of crystal

887
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
yeah but by itself it wasn't all that

888
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,398
good

889
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
so when i did all those high times

890
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,359
events and everything

891
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,440
you know every once in a while you'd

892
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,639
have someone come through

893
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,558
that

894
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
you and they were always old-timers you

895
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,720
know like these are more and they would

896
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,240
just come through and just tell you some

897
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,919
information about a strain that you

898
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,278
potentially have on your menu or have

899
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,759
hybrids of

900
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,278
and this older lady kate had come to my

901
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,720
booth i think it was either at emerald

902
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,159
cup or one of the other high times

903
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,519
events

904
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,440
and she told me do you know what the

905
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,440
lemon g13 is and i said

906
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,080
well i i first had gotten it from

907
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,759
shroomie back in like 2005 or so

908
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,000
so i knew it was old i knew it was from

909
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,919
ohio because he was in pittsburgh so it

910
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,720
was from right across the border there

911
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,720
and um

912
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,038
the lemon g was like

913
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,240
you know

914
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,319
it um

915
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,960
it's a very distinct plant you can't

916
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,558
very mix it for anything else it's smell

917
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,798
how it grows

918
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,798
it's kind of like just a really big

919
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,879
plant with big buds but kind of not the

920
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:15,038
most resonant thing anyways

921
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,799
she said that it was the um g13 right

922
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,119
that's from out there

923
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,519
with a skunk misty from scentsy seeds

924
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,518
that hermied onto it and that's that

925
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,399
story yeah

926
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,079
and

927
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,918
it makes perfect sense to me if you look

928
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,839
at the plants if you've ever grown it

929
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,519
does have skunk number one type growth

930
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,519
characteristics yeah

931
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,880
that's where those long running colas

932
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,839
came from exactly

933
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,840
number one from amsterdam

934
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,959
then

935
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,798
if you've grown the airborne g13 that

936
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,759
weird

937
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:48,960
and

938
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,558
sour

939
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,038
bitter smell brian yeah that's from the

940
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,678
airborne g and so it's like you can

941
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,798
smell it between the the airborne and

942
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,720
it's

943
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,639
it's pretty obvious and then so like i

944
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,038
was saying between all those factors

945
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,759
plus the dwarf virus that's all that's

946
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,960
self-contained to that specific family

947
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,398
of plants

948
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,918
it's pretty

949
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,480
identifiable

950
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,719
yeah i can't say for certain whether or

951
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
not it's all 100 the same family so that

952
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,398
kind of covers the

953
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,358
the airborne g13 right

954
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,960
most likely a clone from ohio um i don't

955
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,119
know any other history other than that

956
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,000
and most likely the parent to lemon g as

957
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,760
well

958
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,679
yeah cool that's what i know as well

959
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,679
about it

960
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,039
ohio this is a little off topic but

961
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,878
since we touched a little bit what do

962
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,480
you think on the purple indica versus

963
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,078
circle

964
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,960
i've grown enough

965
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,119
oh that's what i was going to say

966
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,199
earlier i've grown enough

967
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,720
pi hybrids

968
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:53,358
that i've gotten oracle phenotypes from

969
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,279
purple indica hybrids wow though

970
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,679
it wouldn't surprise me in the least

971
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,839
especially considering how widespread

972
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,799
that purple indica clone or that family

973
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,519
of clones was

974
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,839
i would bet money if you if you showed

975
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,639
that purple indica to greg that he would

976
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,719
immediately be able to identify it just

977
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,358
like every other guy i know that's been

978
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,159
up in seattle and within oregon for the

979
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,719
last 30 years growing weed almost every

980
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,759
single one of them you can pull it out

981
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,919
immediately identifiable by them

982
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,320
i've never tried i should let's see what

983
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,320
he says

984
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,639
yeah what i'd like to do is go out there

985
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,119
and bring him a bunch of samples and see

986
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,879
if he can identify anything

987
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,200
you guys know i mean you guys are kind

988
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,160
of close out there yeah i mean relative

989
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,199
no

990
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,639
oh

991
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,319
oh

992
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,719
but you know what i'm saying though is

993
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,400
that like who knows what kind of smells

994
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,000
he could potentially identify as just

995
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,440
being related to something just like i

996
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,639
was talking about the lemon g and the

997
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
g13

998
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,519
yeah

999
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,280
and then the pacific g13 i never saw

1000
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,719
anything but a couple samples of it and

1001
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,720
it never was very impressive yeah the uw

1002
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,039
purple that purple family that we were

1003
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,559
just talking about purple indica those

1004
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,400
are definitely not related to the

1005
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,358
pacific g13 and then uw was just a name

1006
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,960
for

1007
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,400
any weed that came out of the university

1008
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,039
of washington

1009
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,960
area of seattle which was like kind of

1010
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,440
where you would go buy weed off the

1011
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,039
streets you know kind of like in park in

1012
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,679
new york kind of deal

1013
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,679
like go down to the u district and you

1014
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:28,559
could buy wheat off the streets

1015
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,440
um

1016
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,078
and then you had you know between that

1017
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,200
the glass blowers which was a giant part

1018
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,200
that is often overlooked i and

1019
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,879
glossed over as if it wasn't an

1020
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:45,118
important part of it but

1021
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,119
the glass blowing scene was a large

1022
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,119
part of and

1023
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,680
of the distribution network of clones

1024
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,480
around the country back very much so you

1025
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,159
know when i first got the trinity and

1026
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,920
the and the snow

1027
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,000
uh and you know a bunch of those things

1028
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,039
that was all out of eugene glassblowing

1029
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,039
circles

1030
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,719
exactly you know it was all that was

1031
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,039
that was one of the ways that hippies

1032
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,598
spread and communicated and they were

1033
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,639
blowing pipes and they they had ends

1034
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,240
exactly the dog [ __ ] same channels

1035
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,838
um

1036
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:20,000
try and think of other strains that were

1037
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,679
glass scene um the super bill um i mean

1038
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
there's a there's a handful of trains up

1039
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,279
here that that

1040
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,640
maybe haven't gotten any air time but

1041
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,320
the cough was super um oh yeah traveled

1042
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,759
everywhere through the through the glass

1043
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,599
blowing scene i mean the cough was like

1044
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,320
a

1045
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,720
oh somebody just said the quindy that's

1046
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,200
another one quimby

1047
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,039
i heard of it the quimby is just another

1048
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,639
is from oregon it's just another like

1049
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,639
old it was one of those strains passed

1050
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,759
around those same circles

1051
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,279
the green

1052
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,960
that was one two

1053
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
you know they they even had their own

1054
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,440
four-way

1055
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,320
which wasn't like a four-way from uh

1056
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,000
was like a four-way from oregon

1057
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,838
but they just called it the same thing

1058
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,519
but it wasn't anything related to

1059
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,279
neville's or anything from europe it was

1060
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,800
like trinity by something by something i

1061
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,079
can't remember

1062
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,599
for sure

1063
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,000
but

1064
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,240
so that was that's my knowledge of g13

1065
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,800
you know it's it's

1066
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:21,439
somewhat anecdotal but i've seen a lot

1067
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,640
of samples you know over the years so

1068
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,240
hold on a second people are saying we're

1069
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,039
not just hearing facts we're hearing

1070
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,519
conjecture about g13 the reason for that

1071
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,440
is because the g13 is from the 80s which

1072
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,119
is a long [ __ ] time ago

1073
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,639
and the memories are old and some of

1074
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,960
them are legends

1075
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,879
what we what we think we know for sure

1076
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,240
is that it came out of the pacific

1077
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,800
northwest

1078
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:45,759
okay and that's when it first popped up

1079
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,119
and friends of jorge cervantes gave it

1080
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,599
to neville

1081
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,640
who took it to europe and bred with it

1082
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,880
and that's

1083
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,118
huh i i can add to it and the name

1084
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,720
supposedly came from the license plate

1085
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,559
uh as best

1086
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,480
as i've dug up

1087
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,639
and license plates

1088
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,039
license and then and so it became and it

1089
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,719
became traded so then it was bred in the

1090
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,800
europe and then it was traded in the

1091
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,879
pacific northwest then it kind of became

1092
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,560
this legendary thing

1093
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,000
for the most part and so some of it is

1094
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,920
conjecture because you have all these

1095
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,119
things called g13 but what's their

1096
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,159
origin

1097
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,800
i mean

1098
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,118
one thing i'd like to mention is that

1099
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,440
when i first started growing

1100
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,599
g13 was not a really well-known subject

1101
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,838
the only thing was some intellect

1102
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,599
folklore about it and the fact that it

1103
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,519
was in the catalog back in the day that

1104
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,119
was the only knowledge about it

1105
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:42,079
and no one really gave a [ __ ] at all

1106
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,559
about it until that movie american

1107
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,680
whatever came out american beauty yeah

1108
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,400
yeah thousand dollar ounce of g13 on the

1109
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:52,078
[ __ ] uh american beauty movie and

1110
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,160
then everybody's like what's that g13

1111
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,359
[ __ ] is that some [ __ ] came from the

1112
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,598
government it's the same thing that

1113
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,440
happened with uw is like

1114
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,359
when i was buying weed

1115
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,599
uw was just a str

1116
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,519
came from an area could be multiple

1117
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,838
different strains it was like crippy or

1118
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,679
any of those other names it was never a

1119
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,838
single variety

1120
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,000
and then once you had like the medical

1121
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,000
scene around here pop up

1122
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,239
and you had people trying to like kind

1123
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,559
of stake their claim in the ground but

1124
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,799
didn't weren't really in the scene prior

1125
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,199
to that they're like i have the original

1126
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,640
uw like dude there never even was like

1127
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,679
the fact that you're even trying to say

1128
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,279
you have

1129
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,318
the only you dub

1130
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,480
is how i know you don't have it because

1131
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,480
because it doesn't exist you're trying

1132
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,000
to stake a claim about something that

1133
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,240
was um that was just a name it wasn't

1134
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,838
it's specified to a society

1135
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,679
yeah

1136
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,880
very much kind of like thunder [ __ ] you

1137
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:51,440
know all those or even or even diesel

1138
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,599
yeah yeah i mean my my buddies who lived

1139
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
in new york in that era that that was

1140
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,559
slang for for dank weed right then was

1141
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,079
it that diesel you got that diesel i

1142
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,759
mean now it like means something much

1143
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,680
more specific

1144
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,200
but it started off as just slaying for

1145
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,759
good weed

1146
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:11,199
exactly exactly and no indian guy did

1147
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,960
not have anything to do with g13

1148
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,159
people making up stuffs

1149
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
um so

1150
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,199
while we have you here let's touch on

1151
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,040
another hash plant i know we've done

1152
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:23,519
this before but i don't think we've done

1153
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,719
it on the syndicate show uh hp 13.

1154
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,119
um

1155
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,118
yeah i mean my only experience with it

1156
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,760
is that

1157
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:36,400
i went to those parties in hawaii um

1158
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,640
back in the early 2000s and that was

1159
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,039
that's the same the jason king can of

1160
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,879
bible group of people

1161
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,599
and that was the only place i ever saw

1162
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,358
it

1163
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,200
and it was well known amongst their

1164
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,559
circle that it had come from new york

1165
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,679
city or from new york somewhere right

1166
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,639
um

1167
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:57,199
it's not from hawaii it

1168
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,759
was brought there by

1169
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,358
from my understanding a bunch of hippies

1170
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,720
okay

1171
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,799
and that's that's basically yeah i mean

1172
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,118
what did you think about it

1173
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,640
i always deserve the height

1174
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,720
no well when i first saw it and it was

1175
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,000
like jungle grown i was like oh hell no

1176
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,959
this [ __ ]

1177
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,280
right

1178
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,639
yeah and i think i got the clone later

1179
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,000
from uh

1180
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,960
from caleb

1181
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
and

1182
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,280
um

1183
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,759
i grew it i like the terps on it a lot

1184
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,318
but doesn't transfer to flavor

1185
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,800
particularly well it itself

1186
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,279
um it's more one of those strains you

1187
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,519
can taste it because it smells so strong

1188
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,720
not because it converts to a really

1189
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,759
tasty flavor yeah

1190
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,879
and uh it's herme prone the lower

1191
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,640
bottoms on it always through sacs if you

1192
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,880
would have light leaks or anything like

1193
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,879
that

1194
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,079
and

1195
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,639
it's pretty hard to breed with in my

1196
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,640
experience

1197
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,199
but it has one of the more unique

1198
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,639
terpene profiles out

1199
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,639
so that's one thing jason king was

1200
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,639
correct about is that the the terp

1201
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,039
profile is unique

1202
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:12,000
yeah it's always it's always a bummer to

1203
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,199
me when that hurt profile is so strong

1204
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,960
and direct

1205
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,919
and then it doesn't translate into the

1206
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,240
smoke

1207
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,079
like bubblegum like like that but like

1208
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,399
like yeah like the version of bubblegum

1209
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,440
you know it smells sometimes the smell

1210
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
and the

1211
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,880
you know i mean that's the same thing

1212
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,799
true with hash too sometimes flavors on

1213
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,000
flour don't translate into any of the

1214
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,720
hash you make with it yeah right

1215
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,639
yeah it's not that hp 13 doesn't have a

1216
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,679
good flavor it's just like it's so

1217
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,838
strong you expect it

1218
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,639
promises to deliver more than it

1219
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:47,838
actually does because the spell is so

1220
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,679
potent on it right yeah um but what's

1221
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,599
what it what one thing i've found with

1222
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,838
having run through so many seed plants

1223
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,960
over so many

1224
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:57,599
years is that

1225
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,559
there's this fine line between

1226
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,318
um

1227
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,480
there's like three different types of

1228
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:05,440
textures of wheat in my

1229
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,679
main textures there's really terpy stuff

1230
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,039
that's low in thc and it kind of has

1231
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:13,919
that soft silky feel to the resin it's

1232
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,400
not sticky it's not tacky and you

1233
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,920
can't wash with it at all right then you

1234
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,639
have like the other end of the spectrum

1235
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,119
which is like really high in thc

1236
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:26,400
but whatever terpenes are in it

1237
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,400
don't make it slick right it's just like

1238
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,880
alcohol and water you add enough alcohol

1239
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,559
to water and it won't freeze right

1240
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,838
so if you most terpenes and and styles

1241
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,679
and everything else in it are like

1242
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,119
alcohol-like compounds they have low

1243
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,480
frequencies

1244
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,960
so when you mix that with thc

1245
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,159
you need enough thc to

1246
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,119
stabilize the the terpenes or vice versa

1247
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,960
right so you have really terpy low thc

1248
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,318
it kind of has that soft feel and it

1249
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,240
sometimes the [ __ ] just doesn't

1250
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,159
translate to flavor no matter how terp

1251
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,799
it is yeah they have this stuff that's

1252
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,799
like all thc but no terps

1253
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,039
and um

1254
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,119
and that [ __ ] washes like crazy but it

1255
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,679
always lacks in flavor and then you have

1256
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,079
stuff where it's really [ __ ] terpy

1257
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,399
and it's really high in thc and it's

1258
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,318
that stick to the wall type [ __ ] yeah

1259
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,838
and that's almost always the best

1260
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,599
to smoke

1261
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,078
that's like that's like all the old

1262
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,200
elites that ended up testing between 18

1263
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,720
and 24 thc or something and they just

1264
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,519
had that blend

1265
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,000
of

1266
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,199
terps and flavor and enough potency to

1267
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,280
get you there

1268
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,919
entourage effect whatever you wanna it

1269
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,240
was interesting for me seeing a bunch of

1270
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,720
holding a big library and then when

1271
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,318
testing first started happening and you

1272
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,679
started getting to see what your weed

1273
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,679
was like

1274
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,879
me realizing that like i mean i don't i

1275
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,799
don't know about i don't know about you

1276
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,400
flesh i don't really like most

1277
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,519
30 plus

1278
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,440
strings

1279
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,280
i kind of find them bland like the ones

1280
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,440
that work best for me like are somewhere

1281
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,800
in the in the low to mid 20s most of the

1282
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,838
time

1283
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,599
i mean i don't just taste really strong

1284
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,519
i don't even care about the potency of

1285
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,880
it and at the end of the day i mean you

1286
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,838
know i used to

1287
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,318
have

1288
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,559
jo i mean still have hundreds of jars

1289
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,559
available if someone comes over and they

1290
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,920
can smoke through whatever and that

1291
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,039
purple indica only test like 15 to 18 on

1292
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,119
a good day

1293
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,759
and for 20 years

1294
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,640
no matter what everybody picked out of

1295
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,880
my pile of jars to smoke they'd always

1296
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,000
say that was the most potent strain to

1297
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,200
them had the most narcotic effects

1298
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,559
so obviously thc isn't the only thing

1299
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,879
the other thing is

1300
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,880
there's hundreds of known cannabinoids

1301
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,680
we only test for like 10 of them maybe

1302
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,240
in

1303
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,199
bioassays and

1304
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,679
um

1305
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,838
we and we've just found like did you

1306
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,799
guys see that italian

1307
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,759
um research paper where they found that

1308
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,720
thc that's 30 times more potent than thc

1309
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,560
and they founded power so okay so if you

1310
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,679
have one percent of that that's the

1311
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,519
equivalent of 30 percent thc so get

1312
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,759
power that's 20

1313
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,800
thc and then

1314
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,880
of this

1315
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,839
secondary cannabinoid that we currently

1316
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,960
don't test for thcp if that's what it is

1317
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,519
yeah

1318
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,760
that [ __ ] might feel like it's 50

1319
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,280
right because you've got 30 with that

1320
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,520
extra potent stuff it's like you know

1321
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,400
it's like heroin and fentanyl yeah he

1322
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,079
doesn't

1323
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,160
go fanny

1324
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,160
yeah absolutely

1325
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,759
and for people asking this will be up on

1326
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,679
youtube after we're going to try to have

1327
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,119
it up in audio as well

1328
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,199
later on

1329
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,680
so that's it i mean that's that's kind

1330
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,639
of a tangent but it's basically in my

1331
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,118
opinion

1332
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,838
there's absolutely no way

1333
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,838
uh you know to to tell like how well

1334
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,599
wheat is going to work on someone

1335
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,679
by the available testing that we

1336
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,760
commonly do today

1337
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,159
you can get a general sense of low or

1338
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,319
high thc and you can get some terpenes

1339
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,399
and you can learn some things from it

1340
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,838
but it's not comprehensive enough by any

1341
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,559
means

1342
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,358
to

1343
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,800
to tell you why why it works

1344
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:10,400
the way that it does

1345
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,200
yeah i mean you're you're talking about

1346
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,119
we're only testing for you know

1347
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,199
five or ten percent of the potential

1348
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,480
cannabinoids most of which the other

1349
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,598
cannabinoids we don't even know what

1350
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,880
they do still and then uh

1351
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,119
then you're talking about we test for a

1352
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,640
small portion of the terpenes and dials

1353
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,318
and everything that else it produces so

1354
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,920
it's like we're gonna start making

1355
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,838
assumptions with

1356
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,400
ten percent of the data we're gonna yeah

1357
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,318
that's bad assumptions about the plants

1358
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,240
with 10 of the data that's pretty

1359
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,400
useless science right there

1360
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,199
it's almost like phyllos creating a

1361
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,358
whole

1362
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,558
system on it telling you you could have

1363
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,239
genetic relation with about the same and

1364
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,480
it's also quite possible that we put the

1365
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,719
most importance on thc

1366
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,920
simply because it's the oldest compound

1367
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,519
we know of that relates to marijuana and

1368
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,519
so we've just we've just all been

1369
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,759
preconditioned to accept that that's the

1370
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,000
big macro no you know why we're

1371
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,079
pre-conditioned is because that's the

1372
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,318
compound they made illegal

1373
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,079
yeah yeah yeah you know that's the one

1374
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,838
that the government said was the most

1375
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,839
important compound

1376
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:15,440
and it's at the end of the day it's

1377
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:16,880
probably not

1378
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,800
that's kind of what my whole point we

1379
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,160
could we could know 15 or 20 years from

1380
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,960
now that this combination of

1381
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:25,598
cannabinoids or whatever is actually

1382
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,960
way more important to like this specific

1383
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:32,960
feeling than any number on that level

1384
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:36,240
exactly you know so and now it had all

1385
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,318
these people breeding for 32 percent thc

1386
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,358
with no terps and still smokes like

1387
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:40,800
[ __ ]

1388
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:42,838
smoking gravel

1389
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,760
yeah

1390
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,159
um and it's all because we're using a

1391
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,240
testing system to sell stuff to

1392
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,399
consumers that isn't even in their best

1393
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,838
interest

1394
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,358
you know like you said something the

1395
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:56,159
other day and i know it

1396
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,000
it

1397
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,159
it didn't like a lot of people found it

1398
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,800
controversial but i thought i i could

1399
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,719
relate to it very well and you made a

1400
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,000
comment that you're done with regular

1401
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,318
seeds

1402
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,079
and it's on to femme seeds

1403
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,519
can you can you like extrapolate on that

1404
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,160
a little bit so people understand what

1405
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,679
you were actually saying saying

1406
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,239
oh i'm just making jokes most of the

1407
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,399
time i know but i mean

1408
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,479
but it's relevant right people take this

1409
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,920
[ __ ] way too seriously but i mean you

1410
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,079
know the people that always have the

1411
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,800
most to say are typically the people

1412
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,880
that are offended by it the most right

1413
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,559
and sure offended well maybe they're not

1414
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,400
so proud of what they're doing i don't

1415
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,040
know

1416
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,480
i just i just related to it so much um

1417
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,558
trying to sell regular seats in this

1418
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,760
market right now is is very very

1419
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,280
difficult there's not as much of a uh

1420
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,880
i don't even know if there is a big

1421
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,000
market left for regular seeds at the

1422
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,000
moment

1423
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,440
no i mean mo people aren't particular

1424
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,679
you know especially with the compression

1425
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,358
and pricing people are not concerned

1426
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,879
with doing things the right way they're

1427
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,799
concerned with how they're going to pay

1428
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,559
their bills and make it to the next crop

1429
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,440
or keep the lights on at their facility

1430
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,720
or

1431
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,800
whatever and i mean that's why you got

1432
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,719
people that are like

1433
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,839
you know they got a thousand lights up

1434
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:09,199
they don't know what to do with any of

1435
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,599
the product and

1436
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,519
their choices at that point are

1437
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,960
i'm going to partner with someone that's

1438
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:16,639
going to run the thing and sell it all

1439
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,159
for me or

1440
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,838
i'm going to start hitting up people

1441
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,358
that work at nurseries of other

1442
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:23,119
businesses

1443
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,318
tell their nursery employee hey i'll

1444
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,800
give you 50 grand to buy a clone from

1445
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:31,039
whoever right and then try and undercut

1446
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,400
their market and it's like look you're

1447
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,719
never going to create a market for

1448
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,119
yourself by always just picking up the

1449
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,799
scraps of somebody else's that's a fact

1450
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,119
man it's a fact

1451
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,200
so you know what's the point of picking

1452
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,880
up someone else's scraps it's like you

1453
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,279
should be working on your own stuff

1454
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,920
because then you can then you can

1455
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,680
then you can have enough burn rate on

1456
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,760
whatever that product is for yourself

1457
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,519
that you can take advantage of that and

1458
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,000
be proud of what you're doing and you

1459
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,800
know that [ __ ] won't offend you anymore

1460
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,800
yeah

1461
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,720
that's a fact man one thing i've learned

1462
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,480
too is that all these dudes that like to

1463
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,239
knock stuff off that's what they do for

1464
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,639
a living it's all going to come to a

1465
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,558
screeching halt when a lot of the people

1466
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,318
that are producing unique [ __ ]

1467
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,680
are no longer doing it

1468
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,039
you know once those people are removed

1469
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,358
from the equation then who's going to

1470
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:20,239
make the unique [ __ ] no one that's cut

1471
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,719
off they're done you know exactly it's

1472
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,879
like what uh what's the point in all

1473
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,039
just chopping each other's legs off when

1474
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,200
we could all just be producing something

1475
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,838
only a generation or two removed but is

1476
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,118
now because you did your work and found

1477
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:34,318
something cool

1478
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,079
um

1479
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,039
now the market's bigger instead of

1480
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,960
smaller right well if you guys want to

1481
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,960
survive you better work on making the

1482
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,838
market bigger for everybody that's in it

1483
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,159
not smaller

1484
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:51,279
yeah it kind of reminds me of like the

1485
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,879
just like the the human nature aspect

1486
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,480
of all this [ __ ]

1487
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,800
you know because

1488
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,240
there's a part of it too where

1489
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,680
you know you think about it like in

1490
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,439
music or something like that when

1491
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,279
there's like something you know people

1492
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,519
come out and they just create something

1493
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,280
and then that creates a demand for it

1494
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,400
and then there's a whole bunch of other

1495
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,160
musicians who follow in their footsteps

1496
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,240
because it's easier than creating their

1497
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,159
own thing now there's like a now there's

1498
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,159
like a heavy metal genre there's like a

1499
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,399
gangster rap genre there's like a

1500
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,879
there's an era where like it's not named

1501
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,639
people are just doing [ __ ] exactly

1502
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,720
right and so what's happened with the

1503
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,879
with the named with the named you know

1504
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,719
strain game basically is that rather

1505
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,318
than people breeding a bunch of weed

1506
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,838
that they like and trying to get more

1507
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,400
weed that they like

1508
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:38,480
they're like oh [ __ ] this thing from

1509
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,318
archive or matter whoever is is blowing

1510
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,400
up right now i'm gonna cross everything

1511
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,679
to docido i'm going to cross everything

1512
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,358
to skittles i'm going to cross

1513
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,759
everything to cushman's i'm going to

1514
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,199
cross everything to because it's popular

1515
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,640
and they're trying to put their own

1516
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,239
flavor on it

1517
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,920
but it's not like it just happens in

1518
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,279
weed that happens anywhere where there's

1519
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,440
opportunity

1520
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,640
right you know and you know the other

1521
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,400
thing i was thinking of when you guys

1522
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,838
were talking about the breeding aspect

1523
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,160
was that

1524
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,318
even talking about seeds today

1525
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,000
when you know when neville was on mr

1526
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,079
nice or whatever he used to talk about

1527
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,760
people would all the time [ __ ] that

1528
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,119
they wanted all these pure indica

1529
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,640
hybrids

1530
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,800
yeah but if they didn't yield to the

1531
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,039
roof and they weren't amazing in every

1532
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,960
way they'd [ __ ] up a storm

1533
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,599
and so he was constantly thinking about

1534
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,679
like what he could release

1535
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,000
and what the public would accept

1536
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,199
yeah so it made me think that even today

1537
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,119
right now where you get there's a

1538
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,480
difference between what the public says

1539
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,519
it wants

1540
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,480
and then where its money talks

1541
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,318
in terms of buying seats

1542
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,960
because it says it wants a lot of stuff

1543
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,719
that it doesn't really support

1544
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,480
exactly exactly right

1545
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,078
i think it's the price compression like

1546
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,599
everybody's looking for

1547
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,720
everyone wants something different but

1548
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,119
they all want to sell that have the same

1549
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,199
sales strategy right

1550
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,599
purple frosty and want to sell a hundred

1551
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:01,118
pack right yeah um they're i mean

1552
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,760
they're not everybody i mean there are

1553
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,640
companies that are phenomenal

1554
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,640
they're working on on providing unique

1555
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,318
varieties to their business regardless

1556
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,558
of whether or not it's a hype strain or

1557
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,400
not and and they're in all markets i

1558
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,559
mean there's um

1559
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,079
you know there's a there's a good amount

1560
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,359
of those companies that are working on

1561
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,880
it now um but the problem becomes

1562
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,519
depending on how big their business is

1563
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,000
is the most productive varieties

1564
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,599
typically aren't the dankest and if

1565
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,838
you're selling to a wholesale only

1566
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,079
market and aren't vertically integrated

1567
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:36,000
it's really hard to grow a two pound

1568
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,920
variety instead of a three pound variety

1569
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,880
or whatever the difference is

1570
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,119
and

1571
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,119
just like fruits and vegetables the big

1572
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,559
old monster tomatoes

1573
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,960
typically are the ones that taste like

1574
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,119
water yeah for sure

1575
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,838
yeah i mean that's that's like uh one of

1576
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,519
caleb and i's running jokes dude is that

1577
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,199
the shitty little thing in the corner

1578
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:58,159
that you thought about killing ends up

1579
00:55:55,199 --> 00:56:00,318
being the clear winner in the smoke test

1580
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:02,719
always and you're like why is that

1581
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,480
[ __ ] run over there like why is that

1582
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:07,598
one head and shoulders above all these

1583
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,159
beautiful producing structure amazing

1584
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,680
dense buds all over it and this

1585
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,879
stressed out little thing here that

1586
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:14,719
almost died that's the one that

1587
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
everybody wants to smoke

1588
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,798
i think it's a

1589
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:21,358
i think the the smoke ability of a

1590
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:25,119
stream is a combination of two things in

1591
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:26,639
my opinion it's the type of and how much

1592
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,920
resin there is

1593
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:32,400
on the plant material then there is how

1594
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,680
the plant material smokes itself and

1595
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,160
those are two completely different

1596
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,279
things yeah that's why people like hash

1597
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,078
is because you get rid of all the plant

1598
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,640
material so now the [ __ ] that like has

1599
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,640
good terps or good trichomes on it but

1600
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,798
shitty plant material you can smoke it

1601
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,039
now strawberry banana it's like man the

1602
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,440
flour is completely

1603
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,119
nothing to write home about but yeah

1604
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,599
make some fresh frozen hash with it's

1605
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,480
great it's awesome you know

1606
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,640
banana smoothie so

1607
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,519
there you know there's a purpose for

1608
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:02,400
that

1609
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:05,039
but

1610
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,119
when you start talking about like mass

1611
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,798
versus trichomes

1612
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,480
if you increase the mass but there's

1613
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,000
only the same amount of trichomes it's

1614
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,318
inevitably probably going to continue to

1615
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,760
taste worse so whatever has the least

1616
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:19,039
amount of

1617
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,520
mass that smokes poorly of flour

1618
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,558
material with the highest concentration

1619
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,159
of resin

1620
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,000
good tasty resin

1621
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:26,960
is probably going to be your best wheat

1622
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,440
so

1623
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,960
to me it's just a trichome concentration

1624
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,880
versus

1625
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,880
plant mass

1626
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,318
that's interesting

1627
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,640
yeah

1628
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,880
i i look at it a little differently

1629
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,318
because i i talk about burn ability all

1630
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,680
the time right because that's really

1631
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,039
important to me

1632
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,440
but i i think that there's like a

1633
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,960
there's like an air to bud ratio

1634
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,798
you know like i mean obviously some

1635
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,039
things you put them on this you know you

1636
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,039
put them on and and the thing is huge

1637
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,480
but it weighs three grams

1638
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,159
other thing you put it on and it's the

1639
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,119
same it's the same size and it weighs

1640
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:00,639
eight

1641
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,160
you know so i think like how dense

1642
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,239
things are like one of the things i like

1643
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,558
about diesels is it kind of has all

1644
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,078
those like nooks and crannies and hills

1645
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,760
and crevices and different things the

1646
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,640
way the bud forms

1647
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,960
so it's like it's not that dense

1648
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,719
right and then i think that makes it

1649
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,720
that's what i was saying is the amount

1650
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,679
of trichomes versus the mass of the

1651
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,358
plant material the plant material yeah

1652
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:25,679
and it seems like that stuff washes

1653
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:28,078
better because there's more surface area

1654
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,759
where like this super thick stuff you

1655
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,760
almost have to chop it up into little

1656
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,839
bits to get it to wash well because

1657
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,200
there's only so much exposed

1658
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:42,318
exactly how much

1659
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:42,318
can you get on x amount of mass of flour

1660
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,599
and it's things like bubba right it's

1661
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:47,280
like

1662
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,599
you know you could bubba doesn't have a

1663
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,280
lot of surface area to put

1664
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,240
because it's so dense with plant

1665
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,798
material

1666
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:56,959
yeah yeah and why does it test low and

1667
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,880
why does one little nug like this turn

1668
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,679
into like a joint that's [ __ ] that

1669
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,798
fat

1670
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:02,960
yeah

1671
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,280
that's why because it has a lot of plant

1672
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,960
material mass yeah

1673
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,559
i mean there was there was an aspect too

1674
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,240
where i used to have this i used to have

1675
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,040
this judge of whether i thought things

1676
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,759
were

1677
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,079
like perfect density to me like when i

1678
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,160
was breeding stuff a bunch was could i

1679
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,480
break it off in the dark and put it into

1680
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:24,558
a pipe and smoke it effectively

1681
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,318
and if and if you can't do that without

1682
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,280
like the snow used to be like that like

1683
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,039
you almost needed scissors or a grinder

1684
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,960
you know if you just broke off a big

1685
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,079
chunk and shoved it into a bowl or a

1686
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,519
bong or something like that it would

1687
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,480
barely burn

1688
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:37,838
yeah

1689
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,679
it's so dense

1690
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,159
prohibition selection

1691
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,159
standards

1692
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,358
you know and you know cookies cookies

1693
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,519
cookies can be like that too it can be

1694
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:50,400
too dense

1695
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,639
yeah

1696
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,318
for sure you know it breeds a certain

1697
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,598
density

1698
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:59,679
what have you been focusing on in um

1699
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,359
on your projects lately like is there

1700
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,639
anything you're stoked about anything

1701
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:04,318
you're working with lately that you're

1702
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,318
like [ __ ] this is so unique and so

1703
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:07,920
different that i you know i'm gonna work

1704
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:10,880
on this for a few years anything like

1705
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,880
that apparently going on

1706
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,440
i mean man i'm just always just

1707
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,200
selecting through plants i mean i just

1708
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,000
popped like another 500 seeds the other

1709
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,480
day

1710
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,920
for me it's i just want to find new [ __ ]

1711
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,240
all the time i mean

1712
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,838
[ __ ] half the time all like i just went

1713
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,279
to california and went to all these big

1714
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:28,639
grows and everything and met up with

1715
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,040
everybody

1716
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,039
exciting

1717
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,480
everybody um everybody

1718
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,480
but uh

1719
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,960
the like

1720
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,960
the one that i wasn't really

1721
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,599
particularly impressed with was the one

1722
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,880
that all the biggest growers all said

1723
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,559
hey can i get a clone what's up with

1724
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,760
that one i want to i need to i need to

1725
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,920
make this one a strain or whatever right

1726
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,920
and it's like well i didn't even think

1727
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,000
that was that out of all the stuff i

1728
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,240
brought that's not my personal favorite

1729
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
you know so for me it's like i never

1730
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,798
really know what's [ __ ]

1731
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,559
i just try to grow really good weeds and

1732
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,400
[ __ ] that i think is unique and tastes

1733
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,798
really good and has that

1734
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,240
the right ratios everything we were just

1735
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:13,519
talking about

1736
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,279
and um

1737
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,759
man everybody i let everybody else

1738
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,720
decide what what's really unique to them

1739
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,079
because

1740
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,399
if you told me

1741
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,119
you know

1742
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,200
10 years that papaya would be unique to

1743
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,880
people i'll tell you you're [ __ ]

1744
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,798
crazy right

1745
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,720
that's the most

1746
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,599
run-of-the-mill [ __ ] on the [ __ ]

1747
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:37,358
planet at that time right yeah but so

1748
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,280
only 10 years later

1749
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,239
you know dutch skunk number one fruit

1750
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,119
terps

1751
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:44,719
is unique because everyone grows only

1752
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,039
gelato so

1753
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,118
yeah yeah if you had told me skunk one

1754
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,119
would have had a comeback i would never

1755
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,079
in a million years have believed that

1756
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,720
exactly i mean there was there there was

1757
01:01:54,079 --> 01:02:00,798
a time you know in mendo where

1758
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:03,199
you couldn't give a a cali o pound away

1759
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:05,599
yeah and then you know and then the

1760
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,639
nails got invented and people started

1761
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,160
dabbing

1762
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:12,000
and angie became popular

1763
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,558
but

1764
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,880
i couldn't believe tangi when it when it

1765
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,640
hit i was like what what are we redoing

1766
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,400
callio again what the [ __ ] is going on

1767
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,480
here right

1768
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,760
but but we forget that you know the

1769
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,599
majority of the smoking population is 18

1770
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,359
to 28 years old

1771
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,680
so after

1772
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,838
most people turn 28 they get kids family

1773
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,639
they smoke less they're not involved

1774
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:37,119
and

1775
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:39,519
that [ __ ] whatever was old for the

1776
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,599
people that just quit smoking is brand

1777
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:44,000
new to the next generation

1778
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,838
yeah i mean we we had a we had a like a

1779
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,798
15-year downturn for

1780
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:50,078
perps and then it came back with a

1781
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,000
vengeance

1782
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,000
yeah totally with a vengeance you know

1783
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,159
there there was an era a long time ago

1784
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,679
when when everything purple went like

1785
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,519
crazy

1786
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,038
and then that wasn't the case for a

1787
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:02,480
decade and a half or something and then

1788
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,079
it came back

1789
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,440
and all of a sudden

1790
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,798
you know i you hear that like very 2005

1791
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,798
statement you know like i don't know if

1792
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,400
this is purple enough

1793
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,639
could this be darker

1794
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,200
you see people extending the periods for

1795
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,519
these strains now by like adding two

1796
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:21,199
novel things together so you got like

1797
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:22,719
tropicana cookies and it's like just

1798
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:25,199
tangy but it's purple like the

1799
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,798
blackberry right and it's like that and

1800
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,118
then people are like excited about it

1801
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,280
again you know yeah

1802
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,640
same thing you know it's like people get

1803
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,200
tired of it when it's just the mendo

1804
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,679
perk but you know call it forbidden

1805
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:41,038
fruit and now it's the hot [ __ ]

1806
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:43,199
and now yeah i mean i it's crazy

1807
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,720
um what's crazy about the forbidden

1808
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:48,639
fruit is that when citrus is strong

1809
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,318
it's like one of the most dumb it can be

1810
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:51,679
it can breed one of the most dominant

1811
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,480
terps at times

1812
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,318
yeah for sure you know

1813
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,119
and then it's and it's often a one or

1814
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:00,798
two note terp where it's like you don't

1815
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,240
get other scents it's like when it's

1816
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,838
citrus it's just like pop it's citrus

1817
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,759
yeah and that forbidden fruit is really

1818
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,159
weird because it smells just like it's

1819
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,880
like a one note purple

1820
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,679
it's a pretty plant it's pretty super

1821
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,920
pretty

1822
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:18,480
super pretty and like uh and all that

1823
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:22,000
and you know but yeah it's it just it

1824
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,358
smells like if you like orange citrus

1825
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,798
and that's it well

1826
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:27,920
i think here's uh an important thing to

1827
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,318
i think

1828
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,440
what we're talking about is really a

1829
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,960
product of the how easily information is

1830
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,240
spread nowadays

1831
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,519
because like you were talking about

1832
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,479
before

1833
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,400
how

1834
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,798
uh plant diseases were isolated to

1835
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,079
small groups of people if if at all

1836
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,719
because people didn't really share

1837
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,960
plants the same thing was true with the

1838
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,838
selling part of weed 20 years ago as

1839
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,559
well

1840
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,159
is

1841
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,920
i don't know what the [ __ ] people were

1842
01:04:54,159 --> 01:05:00,480
smoking in georgia or tennessee right i

1843
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,519
just know what i can buy around me

1844
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,400
that's it

1845
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,038
and

1846
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,000
uh so i didn't have this con this

1847
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,000
preconception that i can get some purple

1848
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,639
weed that smells like orange there was

1849
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,119
not choices like that so everybody just

1850
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,519
basically created their own

1851
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,640
standards of quality

1852
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:19,920
and

1853
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,318
preference

1854
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,039
and those were localized to even just

1855
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,199
small groups of people right and i think

1856
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,000
that's why we had so many unique strains

1857
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:29,038
that

1858
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,400
that

1859
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,200
were able to

1860
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,280
survive prohibition

1861
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,399
is because the whole market wasn't

1862
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,559
gelato

1863
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,119
or whatever because it's a good point no

1864
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,519
one had a big enough grow to do that no

1865
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,400
one knew about a strain enough to do all

1866
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:48,480
that [ __ ] so um

1867
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,119
you know every so like strains like hp

1868
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,119
13 survived because that was the best

1869
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,559
weed that a whole group of people in the

1870
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,640
country could get

1871
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,798
and they demanded that product so that

1872
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,558
clone survived and that

1873
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:03,119
you know that was one of the benefits of

1874
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,519
prohibition is that it actually did help

1875
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,280
keep some of the diversity alive because

1876
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,280
you had these independent markets that

1877
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,480
weren't affected from external

1878
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,680
external

1879
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,159
input

1880
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,719
and now we have the opposite where

1881
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,038
everyone is so influenced

1882
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,519
by external input that

1883
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:24,160
almost no one keeps anything unique

1884
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,679
around anymore at all and the customer

1885
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,598
doesn't even

1886
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,239
know that they want it because it's not

1887
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,559
even available in the marketplace

1888
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,479
oh i mean that's something i trip on all

1889
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,440
the time is because

1890
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,519
like california like in in some degree

1891
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,880
like or where i live might be considered

1892
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:42,798
kind of like a

1893
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,039
you know the forefront of certain things

1894
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:48,318
good and bad and one of the bad things

1895
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:50,079
was like the the whole like named clone

1896
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,318
craze that took off

1897
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,240
where you know first it was purples and

1898
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,558
it was cushes and sours and you know it

1899
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,318
just but what that meant is that people

1900
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,400
kept dropping stuff and we talked

1901
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,119
earlier in the show about how

1902
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,160
that g13 cut probably survived in ohio

1903
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,480
because

1904
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:07,759
like you you grow weed in these areas

1905
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,159
where it's good enough weed that it

1906
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,359
always sells and there's not pressure to

1907
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:15,038
change so they keep these favorites

1908
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:18,798
wherever they go

1909
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,240
ohio is are they even legal yet or no

1910
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,159
exactly but i just meant like anywhere

1911
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:24,959
anywhere that doesn't like california

1912
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,399
pressure i mean i'll tell you so to me

1913
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,039
the first real

1914
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,920
praise was the purple craze in mendo

1915
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,160
before that people just grew good weed

1916
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,639
and it all sold

1917
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,639
right and then when the purple craze hit

1918
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:40,879
and it became about the mendo p or the

1919
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,719
urkel or the gdp or you know this half a

1920
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,079
dozen different purple strains there

1921
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,480
would be people that would come up from

1922
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:50,000
the bay and they were like i will buy

1923
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,240
every gram of this weed that i can find

1924
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,639
yeah and so that created this pressure

1925
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:56,000
where all these different growers

1926
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:57,358
were like well why do i want to grow

1927
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,199
this other [ __ ]

1928
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:00,960
i'm just going to turn this 40 lights or

1929
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,558
whatever into urkel

1930
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,720
and boom it out because these people are

1931
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,680
going to cash me out even for my odd

1932
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:08,078
pound

1933
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:12,239
of course yeah and so with every time

1934
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:14,240
that happens diversity gets [ __ ]

1935
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,158
and then you fast forward right fast

1936
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,079
forward 15 years from then

1937
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,399
and when the purple craze hit

1938
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:24,079
everybody starts hitting up like the six

1939
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:26,399
people that kept purple

1940
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:29,838
you know like everyone i knew had an

1941
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:32,399
urkel or grape ape or uh or uh or gdp or

1942
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,479
a mendo p cut oh yeah you know there was

1943
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,798
an era after that where like every

1944
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:39,358
single farmer i knew indoor and outdoor

1945
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,679
ran some sour diesel

1946
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:45,199
but if it's not if it's not what the

1947
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:46,399
easiest thing to to sell then they drop

1948
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:48,559
it

1949
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:52,399
you guys feel like we're in that stage

1950
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:55,199
right now currently with anything where

1951
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,719
a bunch of shit's getting dropped yeah

1952
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,039
i mean i'll tell you something crazy

1953
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,920
dude i had a buddy from from soham hit

1954
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:00,798
me up

1955
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,798
and

1956
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,399
say that a bunch of brokers were

1957
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:07,039
starting to talk about wanting sour

1958
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:09,519
diesel this year and they couldn't they

1959
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:11,119
couldn't find clones of sour diesel and

1960
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,520
soho

1961
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:14,880
weird that is weird because it'd been

1962
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,120
three four years and everybody's been

1963
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,119
growing gelatos and weird hybrids of

1964
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,198
gelato and these weird purple crosses

1965
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:24,158
and jealousy and you know that was the

1966
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,678
only thing that people wanted to pay for

1967
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:27,599
yeah makes sense you wouldn't think sour

1968
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,359
would get pushed out but

1969
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,159
it doesn't take that long all it takes

1970
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,000
is a few seasons or one season

1971
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,198
of your broker telling you i don't want

1972
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,238
it

1973
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,639
and you're going to find something

1974
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,318
though they they do want

1975
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,920
you know or they tell you oh i'll buy

1976
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,560
that but it's going to be this but if

1977
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,960
you had this i'd pay you this much more

1978
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,719
yeah they're going to go that route

1979
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,439
yeah it definitely doesn't have the

1980
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:54,158
cookies appeal at all this isn't you

1981
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,238
know but it's like but everyone had sour

1982
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,799
it's just it's a globalism of the

1983
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,198
marketplace right you know it really

1984
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,400
it's a nationalization but california

1985
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,919
supplying is globally at this point now

1986
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:08,238
and um

1987
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,560
so it's just like you know kind of when

1988
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,959
you travel the world nowadays right it's

1989
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,960
like it's a lot it's not

1990
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,560
nearly as

1991
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,920
culturally diverse

1992
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,880
especially in the touristy areas than

1993
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,640
20 years ago or and particularly 40

1994
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,760
years ago not that i ever experienced

1995
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,199
that but

1996
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,760
um

1997
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,399
it's just where we have this information

1998
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,280
is disseminated so quickly

1999
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:37,759
nowadays that it's um

2000
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,279
that we're losing a lot of diversity on

2001
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,719
the plan

2002
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:45,119
for a lot of reasons and um

2003
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,920
with cannabis particularly because it

2004
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,319
was

2005
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,800
prohibited by the governments

2006
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,799
we have probably the very last

2007
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,360
agricultural crop

2008
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,039
that had its own free independent

2009
01:10:55,359 --> 01:11:00,319
economy

2010
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:02,479
and um distribution system for a

2011
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:04,559
multi-billion dollar planet

2012
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,439
plant per year in value

2013
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,080
with absolutely zero

2014
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:12,319
government intervention and policies

2015
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,039
that would dictate how and why people

2016
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:15,519
would

2017
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,039
operate their business and now move to

2018
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,280
the whole opposite with that with

2019
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,800
globalization and nationals with one

2020
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:22,719
exception to that

2021
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,440
they didn't have any control

2022
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:27,840
over how we set it up except for

2023
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,919
things they did would make us adapt to

2024
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,880
not encounter them

2025
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,719
yeah so all the shipping methods all the

2026
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,679
very all the various aspects of the

2027
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,000
business

2028
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,560
was to work around

2029
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,920
government intervention of any kind

2030
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,400
so they didn't really they didn't they

2031
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:47,039
didn't really dictate to us but they did

2032
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,439
influence how we responded in a way

2033
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,760
exactly but because of that

2034
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:54,079
if we had a much more diverse

2035
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,679
scene because everybody figured out a

2036
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,319
different way

2037
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,480
to manipulate the system to their

2038
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:03,599
advantage so to speak right it really

2039
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,919
was adam smith and the invisible hand

2040
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,039
sure you guys familiar with that

2041
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,880
no

2042
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,238
so adam smith when he wrote about

2043
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,400
capitalism and all that it's like a

2044
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:14,399
super famous thing that he did but he

2045
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:16,319
wrote about basically like real

2046
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:18,799
capitalism is like there's an invisible

2047
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,920
hand that takes the goods from where

2048
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,800
they are

2049
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,319
and pulls them to where they're wanted

2050
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,079
to be bought

2051
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,079
like there's a system that will get set

2052
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:30,399
up if there's a demand in some place and

2053
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:33,359
there's margin and profit to be made a

2054
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:35,599
system will be set up by people to get

2055
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,599
that profit and to bring the goods to

2056
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,360
where the people want to be

2057
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,440
yeah that's exactly what happened with

2058
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:44,079
wheat that's how weed got spread all

2059
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:46,879
over america when it was totally illegal

2060
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:48,000
was the invisible hand divvied it up

2061
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,840
exactly

2062
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,679
okay you know and then the invisible

2063
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,920
hand is just it's just no government no

2064
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,600
government making any rules i mean it's

2065
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,880
interesting that like in california

2066
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,400
especially they made a whole bunch of

2067
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,039
rules and they crashed the very

2068
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:02,879
successful system within five years that

2069
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:04,800
that but that's exactly what we're

2070
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,640
getting at is that like

2071
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,719
if you let the government get involved

2072
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,960
in anything they will ruin it right

2073
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:14,079
that's the general

2074
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,000
rule of thumb right name one war that

2075
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:18,319
we've waged in the last 50 years in this

2076
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,679
country where we want it whether it was

2077
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:22,880
a foreign war

2078
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:26,640
or a domestic war the war on drugs [ __ ]

2079
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,640
drugs are more available and more planet

2080
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,960
we don't win any wars war on

2081
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:33,039
homelessness we don't win anything

2082
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,198
i'm not sure if they're meant to be one

2083
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,840
i i really don't know yeah there's no

2084
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,039
profit in solutions yeah exactly that's

2085
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,560
what i mean

2086
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,399
it's [ __ ] up

2087
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,239
but there's no profit in collapsing an

2088
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,399
agricultural commodity that you're the

2089
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:48,000
one taxing like the funny part is the

2090
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:50,158
government's so bad

2091
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
at their job that they're the only ones

2092
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,158
that make money without having to spend

2093
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,079
any in this real business you know right

2094
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,920
i mean other than other than just

2095
01:13:56,079 --> 01:14:00,000
enforcing the rules that they that get

2096
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,760
written but

2097
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,840
they're taking in what a third of the

2098
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,440
income and the whole state or more in

2099
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,640
most of these cases

2100
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,439
and

2101
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,480
and

2102
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:12,158
the the biggest loser is them

2103
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:15,198
by collapsing the system around

2104
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:18,319
themselves because if the if the price

2105
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:20,399
of weed goes to basically non-profitable

2106
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,279
and i mean look i've talked about this

2107
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:25,439
for a long ass time

2108
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:28,238
without subsidies

2109
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:30,639
and or farmers unions

2110
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:32,559
farming in america doesn't exist

2111
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,880
you've been doom and gloom forever about

2112
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,960
it i agree yes yes

2113
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,119
but we're here now really no he has he's

2114
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,679
been talking about various cities and

2115
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:43,679
collapsing markets and and what happens

2116
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,679
with industrialization and all that for

2117
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,760
quite some time but here's the biggest

2118
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,800
benefit right is because there's no

2119
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,159
union

2120
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,279
and no

2121
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:54,639
subsidies to get this to survive

2122
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,119
that

2123
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,640
the consumption of weeds gonna continue

2124
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:01,359
so a lot of people are just there's

2125
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,119
nothing to save these big corporations

2126
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,158
and these big investment

2127
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,800
firms

2128
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,839
yeah stay in business there's nothing to

2129
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,880
save them right

2130
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,520
and in a

2131
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,520
in the right scenario depending on how

2132
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,600
much it ends up costing a lot of these

2133
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,080
big businesses to operate

2134
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:24,079
and how the consumers

2135
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:26,000
perception and demands may change small

2136
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:26,880
farms might be the ones that come out

2137
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,880
winning

2138
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,000
because there isn't

2139
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:34,239
as we're seeing now in california and as

2140
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,158
the as every state gets its own supply

2141
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,959
set up and there's not this

2142
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,039
um

2143
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,679
distribution network this demand from

2144
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:43,920
all over the world for export product

2145
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,920
yeah

2146
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,639
we're growing way more weed than people

2147
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,639
need to smoke so all it takes is the

2148
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:54,159
consumer demanding a little bit higher

2149
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,640
quality product um and the consumption

2150
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:59,119
amount or the amount of players being

2151
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,480
too many for the amount of consumption

2152
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,359
that's occurring

2153
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:03,279
and

2154
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:04,880
the only things that may be profitable

2155
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:06,800
is small businesses

2156
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,279
you know you guys did you guys not to

2157
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,760
interrupt did you guys see that thing uh

2158
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:15,759
in canada where they destroyed like

2159
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,960
hundreds of tons of unused weed

2160
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,440
they burned it

2161
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,119
because of overproduction

2162
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,279
yeah and they couldn't pump it through

2163
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,198
the system and it aged out and turned

2164
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:26,960
brown and you know they had all these

2165
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,359
huge greenhouses and they did this big

2166
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,279
power play there's an aspect it's

2167
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,960
interesting that you say that dude

2168
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:35,039
because

2169
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,840
there is definitely a bunch of people

2170
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:40,158
that are trying to get into the industry

2171
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,679
by just having a better burn rate than

2172
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:44,399
small farmers

2173
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,760
what they're hoping to do is bleed

2174
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,599
everybody out

2175
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,600
be able to survive longer because they

2176
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,120
have more capital and then take over the

2177
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,719
bones and they end up with a bunch of

2178
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,119
market share

2179
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,520
yeah but what homie is saying is that

2180
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:59,679
they could actually bleed out beyond

2181
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,159
where they're willing to bleed

2182
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,000
exactly and if the price spike doesn't

2183
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:06,799
happen after that

2184
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,079
to like be able to recover they're lost

2185
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,159
because what they're trying to do is

2186
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:13,519
they're willing to lose money now but

2187
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:15,359
they're planning on making more later

2188
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,000
and they just can't the plan is not to

2189
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,759
just light a huge pile of money on fire

2190
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,039
and watch it burn

2191
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,840
no exactly exactly but their problem is

2192
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,000
that

2193
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,960
now that people are growing

2194
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,840
weed more easily everywhere right and

2195
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:35,039
more quantity of it like i mean oklahoma

2196
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:38,319
has intercepted pick six the whole game

2197
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,920
from california in a lot of ways

2198
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:41,759
and that's going to continue to happen

2199
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,640
with every new state that comes online

2200
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,840
it becomes easy to grow more herb so

2201
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,320
like you know

2202
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,000
companies like true leave in florida

2203
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:51,759
well you've got companies like jungle

2204
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,600
boys and everybody else that can come in

2205
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,079
and take their lunch from them from a

2206
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,320
from a business operations standpoint

2207
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:00,880
and quality perspective and then you've

2208
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,880
got the the little small grower chipping

2209
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:07,039
away at you too so i mean like

2210
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,520
the market may not sustain their billion

2211
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:11,600
dollar aspirations that you may not be

2212
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,679
able to be that big and we're seeing

2213
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,520
that in washington already the biggest

2214
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,239
growers in washington are shutting down

2215
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:22,800
2 000 light operations they're selling

2216
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:25,039
200 packaged pounds wreck right

2217
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,840
a thousand light grows that bring in

2218
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:30,079
buyers from out of state buy it from the

2219
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,000
from the licensed place

2220
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,640
that they deposit cash and the state

2221
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,359
knows about it and it's like the the

2222
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:41,840
supply it's there's so many operations

2223
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:41,839
to supply the demand now that yeah

2224
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:47,279
i don't think there is like a rosy

2225
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,119
outcome for them uh down the road

2226
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,359
so they might just be lighting lighting

2227
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,279
tens of millions of dollars on fire well

2228
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,599
if they can't find

2229
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:57,840
more money to keep sustaining their

2230
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,800
money losing operations

2231
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:03,360
it's they're done for anyways i mean you

2232
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,239
know canopy growth shut down their what

2233
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:08,479
did they spend 230 million dollars on a

2234
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:10,718
greenhouse in medicine hat and they sold

2235
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:13,919
it for 35 million recently just to keep

2236
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:15,039
the lights on i mean like jesus

2237
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,279
you know

2238
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:20,800
you can't run a business like that

2239
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:23,198
no flocana up by me they raised 175

2240
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,079
million bucks

2241
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,839
and they they pretty much blew it

2242
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:30,000
right and so where's the ground gonna

2243
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,679
come from when the economics looks the

2244
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,119
way it does now

2245
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,119
yeah and and you know and there's

2246
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,279
another aspect of it too and

2247
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:38,640
uh you you know we were chatting about

2248
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,000
this i can't remember it was last week

2249
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,880
or the week before

2250
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,119
but

2251
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,760
like it is this weird thing because

2252
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,760
since cannabis is legal in some spots

2253
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,159
and illegal in others

2254
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,560
right and the and the and the line

2255
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:54,319
between the two is super murky

2256
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,960
um there's all this there's all this

2257
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,319
stuff happening you know where most of

2258
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,640
the companies in california are

2259
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,479
surviving by backdooring

2260
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,640
absolutely you know that's how they're

2261
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:07,039
surviving and then and then on top of

2262
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:10,239
that like up in you know when the hemp

2263
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:12,000
when the hemp implosion happened in 2018

2264
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,599
uh up in his neck of the woods in

2265
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,359
southern oregon and all those areas

2266
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,280
those places started growing at a level

2267
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,359
never before seen

2268
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,359
and there's all these there's all these

2269
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,519
criminal groups and cartels

2270
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,519
that started doing things on a scale

2271
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,600
that had never been seen before

2272
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,360
and daring the authorities to come catch

2273
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,440
them

2274
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:34,000
right and so there's massive amounts of

2275
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:37,519
weed that are being grown i've read in

2276
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,600
places that that uh you know a mexican

2277
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:44,639
mexican import is down 75

2278
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,440
from from the good days for them

2279
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,520
right

2280
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,479
and and they

2281
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,920
are

2282
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,439
going into all kinds of different

2283
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,119
businesses to make up that lost revenue

2284
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:56,158
right and they're going to oklahoma and

2285
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:57,679
they're going to oregon and they're

2286
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:59,439
going to the desert in california and

2287
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,800
they're setting up these huge depths and

2288
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,479
shops

2289
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,079
trying to make money

2290
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:06,799
so it's like a total free-for-all in

2291
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:09,198
that sense you know it's like the the

2292
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,600
level of overproduction is insane

2293
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:13,359
well yeah and everybody thinks that like

2294
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,280
it's gonna get better and it's like look

2295
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:16,719
for just every person that's quitting

2296
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,719
right now there's another person

2297
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,319
doubling up their garden right yeah

2298
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,480
there's another glass house putting up

2299
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:24,479
another 5 million square feet this isn't

2300
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:28,319
going to get that much better you have

2301
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:30,319
to identify your own market and then

2302
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:33,039
supply that market whatever it is that

2303
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,639
you do whether it's edibles vape pens

2304
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,039
these terp carts

2305
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,480
rosin pick your pick your thing maybe

2306
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:41,439
it's all of them it doesn't really

2307
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:44,238
matter but the market can only sustain

2308
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:46,638
so much of that right before

2309
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:50,158
you start basically eating into your own

2310
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:52,480
profits with your over production so

2311
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:55,519
like i said as more people become

2312
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:57,439
operational more good operators come in

2313
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:01,040
more good black market operators

2314
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:03,119
continue to produce in more states um

2315
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:05,679
maybe it fizzles out for them you know

2316
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:05,679
who knows

2317
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:09,439
maybe it just can't sustain the size of

2318
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,359
business that they want like these

2319
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:13,439
people spent 300 million dollars

2320
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:15,198
building this big grow because they were

2321
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:16,638
planning on doing a billion dollars a

2322
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:19,039
year in sales

2323
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,639
but they only got to 150 million a year

2324
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,960
in sales they're not really reaching

2325
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,880
more goals right so

2326
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,639
um i think that's gonna be the reality

2327
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,920
for a lot of these big businesses and

2328
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,039
then

2329
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,800
if you get these really big

2330
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:31,920
overproduction situations like you have

2331
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,520
right now

2332
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,520
um

2333
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,280
you're gonna see people shutting lights

2334
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,120
off but the thing is is like as soon as

2335
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,880
the the um

2336
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:42,559
like all right let's say you have a 2000

2337
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,560
light operation and you're gonna shut it

2338
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,719
down for the time being

2339
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,400
because you have two of these let's say

2340
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,000
you shut one down

2341
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:51,599
and you're like well we'll just wait

2342
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,279
till the price goes back up well what

2343
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,800
happens when the price goes back up you

2344
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:56,319
flip the lights back on fill it with

2345
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,239
plants and a year later the price is

2346
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,399
back where it was again

2347
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:02,000
yeah this is you know

2348
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:04,238
ag economics

2349
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,198
you know this is just how it goes

2350
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:06,479
and

2351
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:08,399
so

2352
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,799
the real question is how much coveted

2353
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:13,359
cash did we spend on

2354
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,679
growths that don't need to exist

2355
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,279
and if that's yeah really big which i

2356
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:19,359
think it is

2357
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,439
this over production will continue for

2358
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:23,759
quite some time i would think

2359
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,519
i mean really it's two giants with a

2360
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,039
bunch of good weed growers getting

2361
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,159
smashed in the middle

2362
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:32,880
in my opinion because it's like all the

2363
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:34,719
like the two giants are like the all the

2364
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,400
huge black market things that have set

2365
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,760
up by the various groups

2366
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,079
and then the other giant is all the

2367
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,159
backdoor legal weed that happens

2368
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:44,238
and the reason why legal is so pissed at

2369
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,920
the black market is because for the

2370
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,599
first two three years they were dumping

2371
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,880
all their excess product in the black

2372
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:53,199
easy and that was their cash flow

2373
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,880
and now now they're getting cut off by

2374
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:56,960
these ginormous scenes and they're

2375
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,560
pissed off about it and it's tanking

2376
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,119
their price and it's making their life

2377
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,600
harder but but you know so they want

2378
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,119
they want all the black to be shut down

2379
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,360
but they only want the black to be shut

2380
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:09,840
down so they could resupply the black

2381
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,719
they just lost market share

2382
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,880
you know

2383
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,480
exactly they don't care about them the

2384
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,400
white or black sales they just want

2385
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:17,759
market share they just need market share

2386
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:19,599
wherever they're going to get it from

2387
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,880
well they define what's white and what's

2388
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,079
black so

2389
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,000
i mean they're the ones hiring the

2390
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:25,279
lobbyists and are going to be hiring the

2391
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,079
lobbyists so they don't find what's

2392
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:30,559
white and black anyways i you know i i

2393
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:32,079
worked on some on on some big farms down

2394
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,679
in southern california for a couple

2395
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:35,279
years and uh

2396
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,800
one of the things that the sales guy did

2397
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:38,800
that was pretty trippy is he went and he

2398
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,639
looked at a bunch of the data for all of

2399
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,639
the dispensaries

2400
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,719
and he was pretty much like you know

2401
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:47,039
this farm that we have down here it

2402
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:50,319
could probably supply like 80 or 90

2403
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:52,319
percent of the volume needed

2404
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,079
and he was like kind of from the the

2405
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,079
real world so he was kind of tripping

2406
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:57,920
out by this number because he didn't

2407
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:58,800
know all the various nuances that we

2408
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,639
know

2409
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,159
you know but he was just looking at it

2410
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,960
and he was thinking about all the other

2411
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:06,479
bigger farms than us and all the indoors

2412
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,840
and all the depths and all the

2413
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:10,079
everything else and he was like well how

2414
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,679
is this working

2415
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:16,000
and the only way that the white market

2416
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:17,920
can survive is if like 80 of them fail

2417
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,319
if you're if they actually have to sell

2418
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,520
within the state of california only and

2419
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:25,119
no back door exactly yeah and then the

2420
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,520
goal would be instead of like two or

2421
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:29,279
three huge companies that suck that that

2422
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,040
percentage would be a bunch of bomb

2423
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:32,960
small growers that could actually give

2424
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,198
consumers what they want well that's

2425
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,359
what i'm getting at is that yeah the

2426
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,599
market actually shrinks back to the size

2427
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,359
that it's that's actually sustainable

2428
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,360
for the state of california and not

2429
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:45,359
including the export market

2430
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,639
the most of these big growers are too

2431
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:49,439
big for that

2432
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:51,440
like they're they just can't get enough

2433
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:53,119
revenue to sustain the business model so

2434
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:55,439
they have two choices they either just

2435
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:57,119
shut off a bunch of operations and

2436
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:58,879
keep their 200 million a year or

2437
01:25:57,119 --> 01:25:59,840
whatever it is they could get

2438
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,600
or

2439
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,440
and and they just hope they can hold on

2440
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,679
to that from little guys that keep

2441
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:08,960
chopping at their at their bottom line

2442
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:10,880
or at the top line so you know it this

2443
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,880
may go back the other direction and

2444
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,760
people don't realize that and i think if

2445
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,279
people focus on quality expanding their

2446
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,679
market instead of chopping off your

2447
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:20,479
fellow farmers market

2448
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,039
the

2449
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,959
black market operators or backdoor

2450
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,439
operators or whoever you are

2451
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,679
you're gonna continue to see growth in

2452
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:31,759
your space regardless

2453
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:34,319
that'd be my that's my opinion

2454
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,320
i could even say 20 years ago the people

2455
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,319
that i knew that were running 50 and 100

2456
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,359
lighters that were really good at their

2457
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,599
job

2458
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:44,319
they still bought their head stash from

2459
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,840
4 to 10 to 12 lighters

2460
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:48,880
because those that there's just

2461
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,800
something about like a a smaller space

2462
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,760
that only don't you know like you can

2463
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,279
you can

2464
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,719
there's like

2465
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,158
nobody agrees where craft ends

2466
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:00,000
right

2467
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,079
nobody nobody agrees when it's like it's

2468
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,840
just a little too big to be called craft

2469
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:06,559
but i can but everybody agrees that the

2470
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:09,199
bigger it gets the harder it becomes

2471
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,080
to manage perfect weed

2472
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:11,839
you know

2473
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,760
a guy that like works on his four

2474
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,360
lighter after work and is in love with

2475
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,960
it and spends a couple hours in there

2476
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,279
every night making it just exactly

2477
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,639
perfect he probably has fire well i

2478
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:22,639
think as these

2479
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,760
as this profit margin continues to

2480
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:25,359
shrink and then you got these big

2481
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,280
monster grows

2482
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:29,920
i think you're going to continue to find

2483
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:32,479
it's going to be continued

2484
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,960
to be difficult for these big businesses

2485
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:36,399
to find employees that want to do that

2486
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,679
[ __ ] too

2487
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,559
right i mean where are you getting

2488
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:43,039
skilled workers from in this marketplace

2489
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,440
and my my buddy dude uh he jokes that

2490
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:47,840
like it's like a [ __ ] factory job

2491
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:50,000
it is and you're in there and the lights

2492
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,480
are on and the fans are running and the

2493
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,880
decibels are loud and you honestly

2494
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,559
should have like protective glasses and

2495
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,279
some and some that you know and some

2496
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,199
earmuffs and some this is a good team

2497
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,639
it's it's actually pretty fun because

2498
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,960
now you don't have to man it you don't

2499
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,960
have to be the guy like growing weed for

2500
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,279
yourself is being that guy that's

2501
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,119
playing the the he's got the whole

2502
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:13,679
contraption on that's playing like six

2503
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,359
[ __ ] yeah

2504
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,279
like that what the

2505
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,439
running and operating the whole business

2506
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:21,599
itself is that and for some people

2507
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:23,279
that's the right way to do it and if you

2508
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,440
want to control your product and your

2509
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:28,639
market and your marketplace that's how

2510
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:30,559
you do it but these big monster grows

2511
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:32,239
especially when the ownership has no

2512
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,000
soul or passion for the plant and

2513
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:36,718
doesn't want to fund any kind of fun

2514
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,238
[ __ ] for their employees to do in it

2515
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,840
yeah i don't think you're going to find

2516
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:42,399
a lot of people that want to continue to

2517
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,360
do that job long term

2518
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:45,679
yeah

2519
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:48,479
and i i mean there's there's an aspect

2520
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:51,359
too where um and i want to say it before

2521
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:53,599
i forget but when he was talking about

2522
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,119
quality the other thing that i would say

2523
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,920
that is actually going to lead to like

2524
01:28:55,119 --> 01:29:00,158
the next generation of like real elites

2525
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,000
is if people want to breed

2526
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:04,158
uh stop breeding for the market because

2527
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
that's going to change soon anyway start

2528
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:08,719
breeding weed that you personally think

2529
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,639
is fire exactly try to find weed that

2530
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,399
you and your friends love to smoke and

2531
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,800
you love the buzz and you love things

2532
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:16,719
about it grow better weed for yourself

2533
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,600
the chances of that weed becoming

2534
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:21,520
popular is way better than you trying to

2535
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:24,400
create something that you think

2536
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,000
will be popular grow weed you like

2537
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,238
breed

2538
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,520
my only business card and everybody that

2539
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:33,198
knows me is a box of jars that's what i

2540
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,639
show up with

2541
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:37,119
not good

2542
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:39,039
but a box of jars right and then you can

2543
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:41,039
because i can tell you pretty much

2544
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:42,079
everything about a grower from a box of

2545
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:45,198
jars

2546
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,719
yeah you could you should be able to

2547
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:48,479
you know and there and there's an aspect

2548
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,760
to where it's it's

2549
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:51,359
i mean we haven't even talked about like

2550
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,119
if it went federally legal like the

2551
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:54,000
international market and how that would

2552
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:55,039
play

2553
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,719
into

2554
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:59,519
all this different stuff

2555
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:01,279
you know because in each new in each new

2556
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,800
state that goes legal

2557
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:04,639
there's a bunch of investment money

2558
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,880
hoping to like dominate and make a bunch

2559
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:08,480
of money back and it's kind of been

2560
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,719
swinging around the country right now

2561
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:12,479
it's in new york and new jersey

2562
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,158
because those are huge places that are

2563
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:16,479
coming online and all these people are

2564
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:19,198
super excited about trying to you know

2565
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,959
do that you know washington where he

2566
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:22,719
he's up you know washington oregon were

2567
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,800
ahead of california

2568
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:27,039
and we didn't really learn any lessons

2569
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,320
no we just we just would [ __ ] the bed

2570
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:30,319
right away we're just like oh let's just

2571
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:33,198
make a bunch of terrible rules

2572
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:34,960
right away you're destined for failure

2573
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:36,719
but i mean that's that may only make

2574
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,920
sense for california with how we do

2575
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,800
stuff so

2576
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,800
yeah i mean i it's it's hard i will say

2577
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,119
in all honesty it's hard

2578
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,520
because like he said

2579
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:49,679
this is it's agricultural which has its

2580
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,639
own weird [ __ ] to it right

2581
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:54,719
um and it's a multi-multi multi-billion

2582
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,239
dollar industry already

2583
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,399
yeah so it's not like they get to create

2584
01:30:56,238 --> 01:31:00,879
the industry from the ground up and like

2585
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,359
tinker with it they're trying to bring

2586
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,520
this huge thing

2587
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:07,279
into the light

2588
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,560
and they have no idea how to do it what

2589
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:09,599
other thing have they ever done that

2590
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,280
with

2591
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,560
yeah that's a good point what have they

2592
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:13,920
ever done

2593
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,440
you know that's why that's why some of

2594
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,520
this money is so excited they're like

2595
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:20,479
what do you mean there's eight million

2596
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:22,239
pot smokers in my state already

2597
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:24,158
yeah that's a huge customer base most

2598
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:27,279
things you you make that are brand new

2599
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:30,158
you have to build popularity oh yeah

2600
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:32,639
weed is super [ __ ] popular

2601
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:34,559
like it's already popular so and no one

2602
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,520
controls it so it's all tempting for the

2603
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,480
money to be like i want to control that

2604
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,440
for sure

2605
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:41,678
you know

2606
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:44,879
and i agree rings uh yeah i think

2607
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:48,239
colorado probably was falling out uh

2608
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,159
for cali yeah oregon too i mean uh

2609
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:51,919
i was just like i've been going through

2610
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,559
having to delete all my old photos to

2611
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:56,960
keep my [ __ ] from getting uh

2612
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,639
my account deleted and everything yeah

2613
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,520
and like man i was i was like seeing

2614
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,880
memes i was making in like 2017-18 when

2615
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,520
everybody was talking about the sky is

2616
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,600
falling and [ __ ] in oregon i mean

2617
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,280
this is just reality for an agricultural

2618
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,760
crop and if you're not prepared for it

2619
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:13,599
and for um being

2620
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,960
flexible with how you're gonna operate

2621
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,560
your business

2622
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,079
it's not gonna be it's not gonna be a

2623
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,880
good time you know

2624
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:21,039
yeah

2625
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,039
one thing i will say too

2626
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:24,880
and i never really thought that i

2627
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:26,800
i would see this but

2628
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,159
there's an aspect where like maybe for

2629
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,400
the first time

2630
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,638
like being an actual weed nerd who

2631
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:34,000
really loves it is an advantage

2632
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:35,359
because then at least you get to love

2633
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,800
what you're doing

2634
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,158
where a lot of people got into this

2635
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,920
because it was easy or because it was

2636
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:41,920
money or because there was a big margin

2637
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,079
or because you know it allowed them

2638
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,440
travel freedom or whatever and as as it

2639
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:46,880
gets harder and harder they don't

2640
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:48,799
actually like doing what they're doing

2641
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,400
so they get a lot more frustrated as the

2642
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,119
market changes on them

2643
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:54,719
yeah this is just another job you know

2644
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:57,920
yeah it's just an you know and they used

2645
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,840
to make a lot more for a lot less effort

2646
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,520
and now they're making a lot less for a

2647
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,880
lot more effort

2648
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,719
you know where and there's not there's

2649
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,960
an aspect that i see in mendo all the

2650
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:09,119
time you probably see it up there too in

2651
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,198
oregon you know where it's like a bunch

2652
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:12,800
of people that didn't really care about

2653
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:14,319
weed but learned enough to make money

2654
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,400
and run some big [ __ ] and make good

2655
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,559
money for 20 years

2656
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,079
now that it's going legal they think

2657
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,679
they have this like lifetime of

2658
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,760
knowledge about wheat

2659
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:25,440
but they really farmed most of it out

2660
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,960
and they were in it for luke and so

2661
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:29,039
they're really not that talented at what

2662
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:31,439
they do they really don't have the same

2663
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:33,760
knowledge base as like people that were

2664
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,238
nerdy about wheat and kept wanting to

2665
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,239
learn about what they were into yeah of

2666
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:41,198
course so there's an aspect out there

2667
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:43,519
where for you know like being being like

2668
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:44,638
into weed helps because it's gonna get

2669
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,400
rough

2670
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,560
yeah

2671
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:49,920
it's gonna get rough the combo did go

2672
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,039
sideways but sometimes that's what's

2673
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,639
cool about it i mean we could have

2674
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:54,238
talked about hash plants for the last

2675
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,880
hour i suppose

2676
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:59,759
in sequential order

2677
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,920
you know i mean man who [ __ ] cares

2678
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:05,199
yeah i enjoyed it [ __ ] joints here

2679
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,440
what the [ __ ] do you guys want yeah

2680
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:10,000
what are you [ __ ] bothering us for

2681
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:12,479
yeah it is i mean to bring it back to

2682
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,560
hash plants or whatever probably in the

2683
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:18,238
probably in the last five or six years

2684
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:19,760
as people started measuring returns on

2685
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:22,158
on plants

2686
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,840
uh people started making hash seriously

2687
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,679
for the first time in america on a

2688
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,600
commercial scale

2689
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,719
and trying to figure out what cultivars

2690
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:33,039
and actually breeding for hash

2691
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,639
which really wasn't done in the 80s 90s

2692
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:36,399
2000s right

2693
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,440
nobody really people were breeding for

2694
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,039
flower

2695
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:41,198
yeah for the most part you know people

2696
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:43,760
weren't breeding for hash i can't

2697
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:46,158
imagine well especially frozen hash

2698
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,239
which is you know arguably some of the

2699
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:49,519
tastiest hash for sure yeah they didn't

2700
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:51,279
have the gear

2701
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,960
i mean americans like it easy we don't

2702
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:54,800
have like a village that we can just be

2703
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,359
like all right for the next 12 hours all

2704
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:00,800
you families you're you're like bashing

2705
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:02,000
weed over a screen with no with no mask

2706
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,920
you know

2707
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,600
you watch some of those you watch you

2708
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,199
watch some of those uh some of those

2709
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,480
videos of what those guys do and i don't

2710
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:10,879
know how they don't have an allergy

2711
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:12,158
attack like every day of their life

2712
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,840
because they're just in a [ __ ] house

2713
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:14,399
oh

2714
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,239
yeah pounding

2715
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,000
all [ __ ]

2716
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:19,759
beat allergies moved out and did

2717
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,719
something different yeah they had to

2718
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,719
leave

2719
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,319
they had to leave these are desensitized

2720
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:26,560
people because it's just a dust cloud

2721
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,319
you're working in all day long exactly

2722
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,400
if you can't deal with this

2723
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,079
you're not living in morocco but the

2724
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:33,679
same thing is true too where it's like

2725
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:35,920
there's a big push where like a lot of

2726
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:38,079
the popular hash trains they probably

2727
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,800
get popular because they yield great not

2728
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:42,639
because they're the best higher flavor

2729
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,239
yeah there's always that pressure too

2730
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:46,560
there's the money versus quality

2731
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:46,559
pressure

2732
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:52,158
number one was one of the best hash

2733
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:54,560
plants for me ever right skunk number

2734
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:55,599
one and it's hybrids from amsterdam why

2735
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,880
because

2736
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,560
sam bred the [ __ ] for making hash

2737
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,600
right he's a resin farmer

2738
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,440
yeah

2739
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,000
hit like he

2740
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:09,279
made the money that he made

2741
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,279
by breeding a plant for 97

2742
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:14,479
thc in the trichome head and then

2743
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:16,800
selling that as technology to gw

2744
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:18,879
pharmaceuticals like that

2745
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,400
that's his that's his claim to fame

2746
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,520
right there and he's like the only one

2747
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:23,599
that's

2748
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,199
done that even and he did that [ __ ] back

2749
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,000
in the 90s i mean

2750
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:29,279
you know that it's an impressive feat

2751
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,279
regardless

2752
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:33,519
yeah every it's nothing every breeder

2753
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:34,399
should be impressed with but made a lot

2754
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,080
of

2755
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,319
you know the netter hash and everything

2756
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:39,760
else that became popular and now is the

2757
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:41,439
water hash market

2758
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,920
i mean we were talking we were talking

2759
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:45,519
to a camara a while ago and he was

2760
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,679
talking about how he's never even seen

2761
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,760
sam's smoke flower

2762
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,039
that he you know he breathe he's a resin

2763
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,520
that's what he called him he's a resin

2764
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:55,039
farmer yeah i don't like he does he

2765
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,480
likes to breed for resin that's what

2766
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,399
he's after that's what he's interested

2767
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,439
in that's what he cares about

2768
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,359
you know

2769
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:03,359
that's pretty dope

2770
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:07,479
bubble man doesn't smoke flour either

2771
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,479
it's kind of the same mentality

2772
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,679
but you know

2773
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:13,840
i consider sour diesel the diesel family

2774
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:16,239
to basically be like america's modern

2775
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,239
skunk

2776
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:22,319
yeah you know that a very skunk oid you

2777
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:25,119
know type type you know plant type

2778
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:27,439
aromas all that it's a little different

2779
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:29,759
it's definitely not skunk one but it's

2780
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:32,319
definitely like it's in that family

2781
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:35,280
yeah it's modern skunk i mean even just

2782
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:37,279
chem family stuff in general is i would

2783
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:38,079
almost say is cut pretty similar you

2784
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,559
know

2785
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:43,679
yeah big tall running colas on a lot of

2786
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,840
hybrids a little bit longer flowering

2787
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,760
hybrid plant and

2788
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,639
you know synonymous with

2789
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:53,039
you know good quality and uh commercial

2790
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,159
production

2791
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:57,198
yeah

2792
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:59,279
only women and slaves smoke flour

2793
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:02,319
that's my favorite quotes ever it is

2794
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,319
it's really funny quote

2795
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:14,479
was in afghanistan looking for seeds

2796
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,800
he asked some of the hoojadine for for

2797
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:19,678
flour because he wanted the seeds

2798
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:22,239
and the guy looked at him and was like

2799
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:24,000
only women and slaves smoke flour

2800
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:25,599
men smoke hash

2801
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,439
and he was basically like are you a

2802
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,280
woman or a slave

2803
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,279
and he had to explain that he wanted the

2804
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:33,279
seeds from the flower he had no interest

2805
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,920
in the flower to smoke whatsoever but he

2806
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:37,679
wanted to make his own hash at home

2807
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,118
and he wanted the seeds and that made

2808
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,760
sense to the dude but he was literally

2809
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:43,759
like women and slaves smoke flower

2810
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,480
men smoke hashish so i handed them a

2811
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,480
pair of chains

2812
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,600
i mean culturally they're very different

2813
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:52,000
you know

2814
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:56,000
for sure i get it very different well

2815
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
it's an unprocessed product you know

2816
01:38:56,319 --> 01:38:59,920
and [ __ ] i mean

2817
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,400
if i was if you just

2818
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:05,920
if you just grow a field of seed plants

2819
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:07,439
and randomly pick a flower to smoke

2820
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,719
it's probably not the greatest

2821
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,238
experience

2822
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:13,118
no

2823
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:14,718
no especially if the flower wasn't ever

2824
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:16,399
bred for smoke

2825
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:18,399
exactly like one of the one of the

2826
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:19,920
things about sativas is at least the

2827
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:22,559
like you know they were breeding for the

2828
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,719
flower itself to be smoked

2829
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,960
i mean one thing i find interesting that

2830
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:28,319
everybody you always see this comment

2831
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,840
it's kind of a

2832
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:32,719
um

2833
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,880
a misconception in cannabis breeding is

2834
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:37,039
that oh just go back to land race and

2835
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,400
it'll fix whatever problem someone's

2836
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:39,600
talking about like

2837
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:41,759
all

2838
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,880
hear me nowadays because of this and

2839
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,079
this and that

2840
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:46,239
you should just

2841
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:48,559
go back back to the land race yeah get

2842
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,638
and make something new and it's like

2843
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,560
if you've ever grown lots of land raised

2844
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,440
varieties

2845
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:57,840
sativa indica everything in between i've

2846
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:58,879
grown tons of seeds from all over the

2847
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,239
world

2848
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,760
and

2849
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:04,399
guaranteed

2850
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:07,039
the vast majority of them have equal or

2851
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:08,719
higher amounts of hermaphroditism

2852
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:11,279
like you know the plants when you grow

2853
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:13,600
them from seed and the flower's seedless

2854
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:15,679
but it has those little tiny black like

2855
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,039
does and you like roll a joint up and

2856
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,359
it's like all these little black specks

2857
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:21,279
on the table right i've looked at them

2858
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:23,039
under a microscope it's i mean it

2859
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:26,079
literally it sounds like you have spider

2860
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:29,039
mites in your in your flower but it's

2861
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:31,439
i mean they're they're tiny

2862
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:33,600
um those are really common do you know

2863
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:36,158
the rosters pick those out

2864
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:39,760
i need trichome are tiny trichome heads

2865
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:40,719
and tiny calaxes i mean or brax

2866
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,119
yeah

2867
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,679
it's like the majority of what's in the

2868
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:48,238
populations is those type of plants now

2869
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:50,560
the rest of them can be really nice a

2870
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,279
lot of them it smells good is really

2871
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,320
greasy is potent when you smoke it but

2872
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:59,198
the flour itself is just not desirable

2873
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:00,000
has lots of growth problems as well

2874
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:02,399
yeah

2875
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,198
land race is like whipping yourself

2876
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:06,960
oh definitely setting it's definitely a

2877
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:10,319
lot it's pain

2878
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,800
it's pain it's turning back the clock

2879
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,880
and and then you if you

2880
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,279
if you think that that's the way to fix

2881
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,199
a population or something like that

2882
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:21,198
it's basically you assuming that hey i'm

2883
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:23,039
going to turn back the clock 50 years

2884
01:41:21,198 --> 01:41:25,439
and i'm going to do this myself from

2885
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:27,519
scratch and do a better job than all the

2886
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:29,439
people that have done it between me and

2887
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,199
now and it's like dude

2888
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:33,118
we're just like that there was a decent

2889
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,919
population of plants for all of us to

2890
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:38,319
start with in the first place you know

2891
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:40,800
and it's like the the goal is to at

2892
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:42,479
least make hybrids and select for plants

2893
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,560
that'll continue to increase that

2894
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,479
quality so that the next person that

2895
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,880
does that that

2896
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:50,399
that again will continue to improve the

2897
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,279
population better than you did and

2898
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,279
that's

2899
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:56,399
that's inadvertently how we've gotten to

2900
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:58,559
where we are with all the herms all the

2901
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:00,399
feminized pollinate accidental feminized

2902
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,880
pollination that gives us our

2903
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,960
main breeding population of today

2904
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,400
is because it was always the best plants

2905
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,920
crossed with the best plants because no

2906
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:11,279
one kept anything else for the most part

2907
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,039
yeah we've gotten this question a few

2908
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,960
times so i'll ask you what's up with

2909
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:16,238
your malawi uh what's the sourcing on

2910
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:19,198
that

2911
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,718
that came from uh the glass scene up

2912
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:23,519
here in

2913
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:26,880
washington but by way of oregon

2914
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,440
very cool um i don't know anything about

2915
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:34,000
who popped the seeds i mean or how it

2916
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:38,238
got here or anything yeah super um

2917
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:42,960
super like land race like uh

2918
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:44,158
uh obsolete used it right uh

2919
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,399
um

2920
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:47,920
i think caleb had it at one point i

2921
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,638
think um

2922
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,880
shot 707 seed bank had it for sure and

2923
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,920
ran it after from back in the day i mean

2924
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,239
it was

2925
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,560
it was one of those plants that had a

2926
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:00,000
really

2927
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,239
strong

2928
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,600
like hazy aroma when you smoke the

2929
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:05,118
flower

2930
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:09,360
interesting

2931
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:09,359
somebody said more like eugene gold

2932
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:13,118
what's that i don't know when they were

2933
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:14,719
talking about malawi

2934
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:17,118
maybe that was another name someone

2935
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,118
called it

2936
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:22,399
well yeah we talked earlier about like

2937
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:24,559
the weird instagram stuff and everything

2938
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:25,920
that's been going on uh one thing we're

2939
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,360
trying to put together that was gonna

2940
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,319
talk about tonight real quick before

2941
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:30,399
we're done

2942
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:32,479
is that we're trying to put together

2943
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:34,559
the breeders and to get social and i

2944
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:36,479
know like i think fletchy you saw

2945
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,400
flanbelle's social thing he was trying

2946
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:41,839
to put together we're going to use that

2947
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:44,559
similar type platform so we can have

2948
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,960
a nerd ig for us

2949
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,639
so we'll figure it out but

2950
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,319
i wanted to at least get that out there

2951
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,039
today so people have an idea to look for

2952
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:53,359
it

2953
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:56,639
for sure yeah

2954
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:58,158
uh anything you're dropping soon fletch

2955
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,440
well maybe i don't know but i'm not

2956
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,000
gonna plug [ __ ] on here we're just

2957
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:02,000
talking weed

2958
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:05,279
that's cool as [ __ ] dude um

2959
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:06,719
yeah

2960
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,359
not so

2961
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:11,359
no i mean i i i obviously had a pretty

2962
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:12,479
wide ranging conversation sometimes it's

2963
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:14,639
good

2964
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:16,959

2969
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:27,279

twice as long as everything else

2975
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,279

unique space

2978
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:43,840
