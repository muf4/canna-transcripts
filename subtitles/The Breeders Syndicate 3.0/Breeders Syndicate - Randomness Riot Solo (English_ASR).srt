00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,959
covid spreading dirty pumps so whatever

42
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,959
it is what it is

43
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,359
is blue dream trash or fire depends on

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
what blue dream you got if you got a

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
blue dream that

46
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,359
isn't the the old sc cut then probably

47
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,598
trash i mean i haven't really seen good

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
blue dreams aside from the old cut and

49
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,959
that's how you usually know someone says

50
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,239
blue dream sucks either they're [ __ ]

51
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,239
grow or they never had the real cut

52
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,280
how weed came from the serious a and b

53
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,239
and how it's being you never know you

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
know

55
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
maybe it was what's the word not

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
panspermia but

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
the galactic spermia maybe that's how

58
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,439
[ __ ] weed came from

59
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,599
do you think other entities have

60
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,840
cannabis wherever they're from

61
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,359
i would think that they've figured out

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
how to

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,080
get high off other [ __ ] you know

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,159
or maybe they know how to trigger their

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,120
own brain chemistry through whatever i

66
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,439
don't know i don't even know if i

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
believe that there are other things

68
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,079
outside of uh humans

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
a very unfortunate humans but

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
i've been studying

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
ufo since i was a young kid very young

72
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,399
kid and um

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,639
my my

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
evolution through through belize has

75
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,479
been very

76
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,399
fluid and it's had to be

77
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,759
because

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,319
it took me a long time to realize how

79
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,239
many people were con artists and

80
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
you know it's just like any any field

81
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,039
any field you get into whether it's

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
cannabis or

83
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,560
the ufo world everybody's [ __ ] trying

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
to make money off something with some

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,280
agenda

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
is your favorite strain still the

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
strawberry switchblade well my favorite

88
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,798
strains are usually berry based so yeah

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,039
it's one of them it's definitely one of

90
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,719
them um i'd like to bring it back

91
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,560
sometime soon but

92
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,840
it's really hard to tell what the market

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
wants right now

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,120
um the last live read i did i talked a

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,318
little bit about it tiny tiny little bit

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,599
about um

97
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,680
about that

98
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:21,039
and and and the decline of the cannabis

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
industry and how fast it's hidden

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
uh you classify

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,079
what do you classify a generation after

102
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,279
open pollination well i mean if you're

103
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,359
if you're taking it back to an open

104
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,159
pollination then the next generation

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
technically not by scientific standards

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
would be an f1

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
that's how it's used in cannabis so we

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,319
just stick with that so other people can

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
understand it talk about irene uh irene

110
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,800
came from

111
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,800
smoke to herb and uh rude boy rude boy

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,079
it came out of a bag of wheat originally

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
that and

114
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,839
um

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
someone was selling his irene and they

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,918
they tried to get that cut or didn't get

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
the cut or whatever but then they found

118
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,519
a cut later on that was so much like

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,879
that weed that they called it irene

120
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,680
again and that's the cut that we now

121
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,120
have so it's more irene too

122
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
that's that's really the only one that

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
people um

124
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,839
see

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,720
yeah the market doesn't know what it

126
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,478
wants it doesn't it's just an ignorant

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
ass market

128
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,359
but i say that that hurts people's

129
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,839
feelings are there any breeders out

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,560
there that work lines anymore only a few

131
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,159
but there's not there's not what's that

132
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,360
smoke to earth um there's not

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
uh

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
there's not a demand for work lines

135
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
right now

136
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,639
it takes time generations to work lines

137
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
and

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,400
you can't stay above

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,038
the curve if you're if you're working

140
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,719
lines and that's really the way it is

141
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,319
uh do you feel like strains are good

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
enough or do you think breeding is still

143
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,478
a need

144
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,159
good enough for who

145
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,000
good enough for who is the question you

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,759
know like some people are happy with

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
cookies and cookies hybrids

148
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,478
um origins of sour diesel

149
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,559
uh

150
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,399
that's a long one to go into that is a

151
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,839
long way to go into but basically it's

152
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,839
uh

153
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:18,079
a super skunk of sorts maybe

154
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,839
it looks like a super skunk um but it

155
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,240
came via viavondo and manny and klopp

156
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,879
those are three names that you can legit

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,680
associate with it

158
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,839
it contains alien shmeggy is what it

159
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,840
contains let's see

160
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,159
um time warp wasn't an old-school tga

161
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,000
that was at the end of tga

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
uh

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,399
let's see

164
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,478
super skunk cam i would say that that is

165
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,519
a good assumption

166
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,959
chem 91 or a chem bag seed across to

167
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,159
whatever super skunk was going around

168
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,839
and since we know

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,560
there were like two different super

170
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,399
skunk types going around at that time

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,160
um it's one of those two

172
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,159
it's it's it's during an era where

173
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,038
we don't know which cup was passed a

174
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,360
super scout

175
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,478
does everyone have some really suit i

176
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,919
don't know what you're asking but i

177
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,359
think you're asking if people really

178
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,359
have super scope

179
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,919
uh not uh

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,520
it's readily available it's very easy to

181
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,318
get with that said

182
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,918
no

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
for some reason nobody's using real

184
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,000
super skunk i mean not nobody but very

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,439
few people are using real super skunk in

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,038
their lines that are calling [ __ ] super

187
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,879
skunk and most of them don't know how to

188
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,279
identify what super skunk is in the

189
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,120
first [ __ ] place snow dog is still

190
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,038
around i don't have that cut anymore

191
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,399
mine came via matt elite

192
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,598
um

193
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,519
but i don't know who's holding it

194
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,839
anymore it was very similar to diesel

195
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,758
what's up mid-style broganics who are

196
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,119
your favorite breeders i see that's the

197
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
question i always get and like i'm

198
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,199
always i hate doing it because there's

199
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,519
so many people i would forget you know

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,319
like i hate just naming a few

201
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:03,359
so but you can see who like i interact

202
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,360
with who's stuff i use who

203
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
are our tight friend crew like there's a

204
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,879
reason we're all close it's because we

205
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,878
all respect each other in our work

206
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,879
didn't skunky popularize super

207
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,038
his mentor was the person who

208
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,560
popularized the super skunk and skunk va

209
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,839
is a reason

210
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,439
one of the reasons that it was in

211
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,519
several people's hands so i i would say

212
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,439
yes that's that's partially correct

213
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,399
uh could you name some african strange

214
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,200
red congo i really enjoyed the herb um

215
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,440
good my favorite was uh the senegalese

216
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,320
haze from afropips who is no longer with

217

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,759
different different areas that had their

228
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,759
their own specific uh lines

229
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,600

i haven't tried it haven't haven't

234

smelled it haven't smoked it

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
but visually super skunk's very easy to

236
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,080
identify for me so

237
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,599
yeah

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,720
elephant ear from africa yeah i've never

239
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,639
heard of that one

240
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,920
i remember that [ __ ] quote-unquote

241
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,759
elephant ear tie that uh that that

242
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,199
tweaker ass golden coast was showing and

243
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,278
passing to people that was a big old

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
[ __ ] broad-leafed afghani

245
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,600
uh

246
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
skunk lovers could look in the sky why

247
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
why that's just bad info that's the

248
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,399
worst info i've ever heard hey if you

249
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
like skunk smells go look at skunk one

250
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,559
like i've spent

251
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,360
15 years telling people that that is the

252
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,439
the

253
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,440
one thing don't do is waste your time

254
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
why do you think nobody is finding skunk

255
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,200
and skunk one well i mean

256
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,319
why would you pass that advice or you

257
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
just don't know and you're just passing

258
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
advice for shits and gigs which

259
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,720
whatever

260
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,799
um

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
most greasy indica you can find in seed

262
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,639
form depends on what you consider indica

263
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,320
i mean

264
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,958
um

265
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,959
greasy

266
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,600
afghani pakistani maybe chitral is a

267
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,078
little greasier than most how do you

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
feel about ego's genetics i never heard

269

of her did you ever experience skunk in

270
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,759

271
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,000
the cuts that are going on i am way too

272
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,559
young like during the 90s i was smoking

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,919
brickweed like that's just what we had

274
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,119
at the time

275
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,479
by the time

276
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
skunk

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,159
had had declined was about the time i

278
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,399
started by like really dang [ __ ] so uh

279
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,399
not back then no

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,799
what was cornbread mafia

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,679
uh cornbread mafia was a group of guys

282
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,278
that all were working in the um like

283
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,958
what the south florida

284
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,879
louisiana and that

285
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,879
region moving a lot of weed back then

286
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
skunk in black domina there were so many

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,399
different versions of black domina and

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
i've never seen a really good one myself

289
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
so i don't know and it just depends are

290
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,040
you talking about skunk one are you

291
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,160
talking about does it have skunky terps

292
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,159
because those are two different things

293
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,919
your skunk one was light floral smells

294
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
with some odd smells yeah the way you

295
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,519
recommended [ __ ] skunk one for skunk

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
you didn't even have it you didn't get

297
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
it

298
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
that's silly

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,360
uh the only skunk i had was triple h i

300
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,519
never heard that one um

301
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
top notch og kush you've ever tried

302
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
triangle

303
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,919
[ __ ] the kush cut by a resin uh luio

304
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,480
g's great

305
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,439
my girl tokyo roses tokyo og i need to

306
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
give her a call uh is great um

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
i don't even know if that's still around

308
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,039
though um i mean there's all kinds of

309
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,959
great ogs that are [ __ ] the same

310
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,399
exact cut too with different names or

311
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,319
bag seed thereof very similar

312
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,919
i think diesel crusted cheese would be

313
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
funky i would think so i would think

314
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,278
that it has potential but because

315
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:16,639
because uk cheese also expresses as

316
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,559
fruity sweet berry um aside from just

317
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
cheese i would think that it would throw

318
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,679
a lot of variation and probably not be

319
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,559
the most ideal but you if you

320
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,399
in theory if you had a big enough uh pop

321
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,479
of the seeds you might be able to find

322
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,639
it or in the f2 generation of it you

323
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,000
ever had norcal lavender dude so many

324
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,519
people consider lavender so many

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,559
different things

326
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,078

of us that don't know yeah bluebonnet

336
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:01,119
was made by lonestar from texas resident

337
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,799
company who's no longer with us um

338
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
uh he was releasing that at the same

339
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,639
time i was releasing my first riotberry

340
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,639
stuff and working those lines so at the

341
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,720
time i didn't pay any attention to it he

342
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
was competition and i was an [ __ ] so

343
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,639
i just i was like [ __ ] it i got the best

344
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
[ __ ] i don't what [ __ ] i need his [ __ ]

345
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
for so

346
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,560
over time

347
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,319
um as as a lot of seed makers did back

348
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,838
then we sold every last bit of our stock

349
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,720
of [ __ ] because it was not easy to make

350
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,240
money

351
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,600
so

352
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
i didn't have any more of my right bear

353
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,000
stuff and i lost them all so i knew i'd

354
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
have to go back and revisit blueberry

355
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,919
and when i did i had kept that in my

356
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,278
mind all those years ago that you know

357
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,879
multiple people had told me that the

358
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,879
bonnet was a great place for blueberry

359
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,919
muffin turps and blueberry candy and all

360
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,958
that stuff

361
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,958
so

362
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,719
i popped those along with

363
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,399
i can't remember how many other blue

364
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
lines but there was a shitload a

365
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,958
shitload old and new blue lines by dj's

366
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,039
work and others work

367
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,399
and others work with dj's work which is

368
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,399
what blue bonnet supposedly is

369
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,559
it is the most supreme

370
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,240
blue breeding line i've ever seen

371
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,000
um

372
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
hands down better better than anything i

373
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
ever made

374
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,078
uh way better

375
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
if i'm being honest so it's kind of a

376
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,958
bummer that i was such an [ __ ] i

377
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,959
didn't reach out to lone star back then

378
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,119
and try to collaborate work with him but

379
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,359
we live and learn you know um best i

380
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
could do is honor his work now and make

381
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,759
sure he still gets the respect he

382
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,199
deserved back then

383
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,439
but yeah that's what blue bonnet is it's

384
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,838
a it's a perfect blue breeding line for

385
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,920
for berry

386
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,920
terps it it's pretty you want to show it

387
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,320

don't want people to see it yeah

395
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,159
i'm proud of that

396
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,600
do you think uk cheese is more skunk

397
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,039
than skunk well no it's just skunk one

398
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
it's a selection of skunk one jj sent a

399
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,078
podcast a mass super skunk that greg had

400
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720

401
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,479
no picks of yes jj is a thousand percent

402
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,959
correct in that

403
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,480

408
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
lone star sharing no i haven't

409
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,079
okay the only person who would ask about

410
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,439
blue sky is vienna it would be blue

411
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:32,078
skies vie anna

412
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,079
so bye-bye

413
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,559
no one's that stupid now can you talk

414
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,638
about your jesus ones yeah it's a it's a

415
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,599
super skunk it's a it's

416
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,799
so for a long time diesel was considered

417
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,440
uh or recorded as a a uh

418
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,319
a mass super

419
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,079
across to chem dog d reversed now nobody

420
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
was doing reversals back then so it was

421
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,399
implying that camdee had hermed on the

422
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,720
mass super however

423
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,839
chemd does not normally spit viable

424
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,000
pollen very unlikely very unlikely that

425
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,959
the pollen donor even if it does herm

426
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,958
however mass super skunk was a herm bomb

427
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,559
and you know when you make when you when

428
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,000
you put the s ones out when you do the

429
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,679
crosses you don't see any chem d in the

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
crosses however you see a ton of super

431
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,799
skunk tons and tons of super skunk but

432
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,120
nothing cushy you know so um and when i

433
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,599
say cushy i don't mean like bubba kush i

434
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,639

435
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,560
buds super frosty like a uh

436
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,198
chem d express is very heavy afghani to

437
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,198
me like that

438
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,198
i don't know if i answered that but

439
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,639
whatever

440
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,758
you have any new projects you're excited

441
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,879

443
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,360
on coming up very soon i don't want to

444
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,559
say what it is just because people will

445
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,759
pretend they've already done it and

446
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,439
release it tomorrow and a bunch of

447
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
dummies will go buy it so

448
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,639
leave it at that

449
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,240
but expect some good things in the next

450
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
few months

451
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
which of the crosses is the most

452
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,399
homogeneous with the least amount of

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,560
phenos

454
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
i would say deep chunk deep chunk if

455
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,838
you're going to if you want to get

456
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,439
something close to ibl deep chunks a

457
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,318
great selection for that

458
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,120
um

459
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,119
oddly enough uh cedarbury farms uh

460
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,719
strawberry sour which was the east coast

461

466

one of my favorite um cuts it's one of

503
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
my favorite lines to work with however

504
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
there's not much hype for bubba kush so

505

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,400
right now let's see

533
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
we bitcoin

534
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,120
and we still take credit cards so there

535
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,199
is that

536
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,798
um yeah i don't think most people know

537
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,519
that yet but

538
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,200
whatever okay did some house cleaning

539
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,798
there you go

540
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
will crybaby ever be on breeder

541
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,359
syndicate uh there there is a chance

542
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,839
there's a chance bubba kush versus socal

543
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,439
mat socalcut um

544
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,359
there's not much of a difference if you

545
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,000
ask me but i mean if you want to pick it

546
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,038
apart it would be by growers

547
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
like

548
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,319
in in certain rooms certain environments

549
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,798
are both going to look pretty goddamn

550
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,798
similar um the socal master kush cut had

551
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,918
a lot more purple tendency to it in

552
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,759
itself

553
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,679
didn't breed it as heavy whereas bubba

554
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,000
was the reverse of that for me it bred a

555
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,840
lot of purple traits and

556
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
but the plant didn't really turn purple

557
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,240
itself

558
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
you still have yet to find a seed with

559
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,558
the lady hermione the final three yeah

560
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,720
see that's pretty cool

561
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,839
um not cool that herms but you know

562
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,839
whatever

563
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,079
uh pakistan's charlie cush you mentioned

564
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,240
you hated those chirps is it dark and

565
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,798
robust herbs no i i don't i don't hate

566
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,798
uh chitral terps uh chitral does have a

567
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,720
lot of um terpenoline in it which for

568
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,599
something that isn't like a

569
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,519
a

570
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,199
type is is kind of

571
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:09,679
unique um but the old chitral

572
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,798
like that wasn't line bred towards being

573
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,200
purple

574
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,038
like the one that ace released early on

575
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,480
and

576
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,000
that one had a lot of lemon to it like

577
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
the green peanuts were super lemon and

578
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,759
i'm not a big lemon guy but it was it

579
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,798
was a nice lemon it wasn't like in your

580
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,359
face

581
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,960
like offensive lemon if that makes sense

582
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,158
and the blackberries in there of course

583
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,840
and it just depends on if you like

584
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,840
blackberry uh terps or not

585
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,480
okay which one of my crosses is the most

586
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,319
homogeneous with fifino's um i would say

587
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,679
banana tie is probably the most

588
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,720
homogeneous

589
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,759
um

590
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,679
there are

591
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,400
different phenos in it but most of them

592
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
all

593
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,159
kind of center around one general look

594
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,880
that is the the juicy fruit thai mom

595
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,200
and uh let's see

596
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,110
chunky monkey which is probably because

597
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,080
of deep chunk also very uniform um

598
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:02,479
[Music]

599
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,158
bubble berries been pretty uniform oddly

600
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,079
enough but but those two just combined

601
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,640
so well to to not to have too many

602
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:12,399
freaking phenos in it

603
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,480
uh what else in the newest stuff the uh

604
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,720
the white bonnet was very homogeneous as

605
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,720
well

606
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,159
super rokyo mentholated cherry cola

607
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
yeah nasty nate calls all his strings

608
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,440
common names that are i i have no idea

609
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,439
who nasty nate's

610
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,599
what's up tony do any work with cush

611
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,840
ford no

612
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,279
uh how do you know when to harvest if

613
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,879
you lost your scope

614
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,000
where you just pick some dry it and

615
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,240
figure out where you like to smoke it at

616
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,839
well yeah we need that right coin that

617
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,359
right crypto

618
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,678
right

619
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,519
i'm sure that'd do great is papaya just

620
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,320
green crack i i doubt it um

621
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,759
those

622
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,319
those dudes wouldn't have even had

623
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:04,319
access to green crack so

624
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,319
yeah no i'm gonna say no on that

625
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,720
do you think you'll create a heirloom

626
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,038
strain of course it takes time but do

627
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,038
you have any faves you plan to afghan oh

628
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,960
and to create an heirloom strain i would

629
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,319
have to get everyone across the country

630
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,558
growing it all at once and they all want

631
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,439
cookies so no probably not but

632
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:20,839
um

633
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,440
as far as working

634
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,279
lines god it's been years it's been

635
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,600
years i don't there's just no place for

636
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,319
it right now there's no place for it if

637
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,839
if people would actually like

638
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,000
understand that that's a good thing to

639
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,319
have worked lines um

640
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,558
and want uniformity in their garden and

641
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,158
uniformity for breeding and making seeds

642
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,960
then yeah we could go back to that but

643
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,720
there's there's just no

644
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,880
it's not financially viable in the in

645
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,640
this in this community like nobody gives

646
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,559
a [ __ ] about that they just want [ __ ]

647
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,559
wedding cake and

648
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,119
whatever else that [ __ ]

649
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,119
people hype

650
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,599
can you speak on mob or jerry berry you

651
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,519
know the mob cut going around is just a

652
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,678
minute purpose blueberry

653
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,519
i don't think it's anything special

654
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,038
so

655
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,720
but it does breed well if you if you're

656
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,720
making blueberry lines i'll give it that

657
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
um but as far as it being jerry berry i

658
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,319
doubt the cut going around probably has

659
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,319
nothing to do with the original uh mob

660
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,319
cut

661
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:26,639
can i talk about uncle fester why

662
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,319
it's [ __ ] that's not even a thing um

663
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,240
not not what's being passed as uncle

664
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,240
fester skunk uncle fester is this old

665

666
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,720
like

667
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,399
drug chemist guy he was pretty wild um

668
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,240
he may have done breeding i don't know

669
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,759

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,120
fester skunk had nothing to do with

671
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,119
uncle fester didn't know uncle fester

672

wasn't even around for uncle fester

673
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,759
um so i really think it was just taking

674
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,278
his name and slapping it on something

675
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,440

2

682
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,519
yield well in height and i say all of

683
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,158
the blue bonnet stuff uh washes

684
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,278
extremely well and and rosin we've been

685
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,440
having really good results with

686
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,000
everything it's just the kind of

687
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,640
the kind of um trichomes that the the

688
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,919
male pushed and they and the amount of

689
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,278
resin production that the male pushed

690
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,159
into these lines is pretty [ __ ]

691
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,558
awesome and it's perfect for it

692
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,919
malibu purekush had the cakiest terps

693
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,480
i've ever smelled you ever come across

694
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,320
that i've never come across a cut called

695
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,038
malibu pure kush but i do remember real

696
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,798
pure kush and socal pure kush that also

697
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,158
people have called suge knights pure

698
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,918
kush which had nothing to do with it was

699
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,600
a bubble hybrid and i've seen people

700
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,360
call it malibu pure cushion hollywood

701
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,278
pure kush but i only know one and that

702
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,918
is the pure kush and i wouldn't say it

703
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,679
was super cakey for me but again it

704
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,120
depends on how you grow it

705
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
how you grow

706
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,759
determines the expression of whatever

707
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,158
phenotype you're trying to pull

708
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,679
some some cuts are more uniform like

709
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,080
depending on your your environment some

710
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,320
cuts really do well it's staying

711
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,918
very uniform at how they express

712
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,839
lots of others like uk cheese for

713
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,360
example can come out [ __ ]

714
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,240
looking like two different [ __ ] whole

715
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,839
different plants that you wouldn't

716
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,839
believe were the same cut

717
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,679
what would you work if money was no

718
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,798
issue good one shawnee um

719
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,480
right now i'd go back and work the

720
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,679
strawberry stuff i'd work it really

721
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,120
heavy

722
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
specifically the east coast sourdough

723
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,079
strawberry cream i'd like to to do some

724
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
work with that and my strawberry

725
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,879
switchblade

726
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
um

727
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
probably do more with a banana tie to be

728
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,480
honest with you too um

729
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,000
and if money was no issue some of the

730
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,360
blue bonnet stuff um the banana headband

731
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,480
i'd like to do more work with because

732
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,278
there was some cool [ __ ] coming out of

733
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,759
that

734
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,000
um what else

735
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,000
uh

736
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,240
the grape pie

737
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,319
um platinum banana og made some

738
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,278
beautiful stuff that's relevant or or

739
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,960
would do well in today's market um and

740
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,119
is worthy of being around and not just

741
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,319
another [ __ ] cookies hybrid

742
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,558
um

743
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,960
a sour apple platinum banana og also was

744
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,240
pretty cool um as far as being worked i

745
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,720
think that there's there's some cool

746
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
[ __ ] in that

747
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,919
is there anything new or is it all the

748
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,119
same just i mean just look just look at

749
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,400
what's around

750
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,798
everything looks like [ __ ] wedding

751
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,519
cake or gelato

752
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,440
hannah

753
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,319
you have the original blueberry did you

754
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
get it from archives

755
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,439
uh let's see

756
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,798
i mean it's the reason i'm laughing is

757
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,480
because it's a very bold claim to say

758
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,480
you have the original blueberry

759
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,880
like cite your source

760
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,679
what's your provenance what's you know

761
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
like

762
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,080
dj claims the same thing you know as

763
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,759
does [ __ ] that other dildo who calls

764
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,839
himself the original dj short jaime

765
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,960
chiba like they all claim it a lot of

766
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,678
people say they have the original

767
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,519
blueberry there is a cut from oregon

768
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,919
that is the oregon blueberry the archive

769
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,158
sells it came from scott reach moonshine

770
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,320
man is it the original i don't [ __ ]

771
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,640
know about all that [ __ ] but it wasn't

772
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,200
the first one that people saw but it's

773
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,278
good supposedly did you pop any electric

774
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
lemonade my pack had some crazy tourist

775
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,880
a couple herms yeah that's going to be

776
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,840
the problem with the lemon tree

777
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,679
it just is part of lemon tree

778
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,839
usually they're very sterile so they

779
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,600
don't cause a lot of problems but

780
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,038
if you if you if you run lemon tree

781
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,678
hybrids you're just going to end up

782
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,000
getting herms it just is what it is also

783
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,360
if you want to um

784
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
if you want to curb a lot of that and i

785
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,359
always recommend this to people and it's

786
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,399
i verily see see it taken

787
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,558
seriously

788
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,398
but take clones from your seed moms and

789
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,798
run the clones seed moms have a lot of

790
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,158
hormones in them um and and taking

791
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,278
clones of it and running that allows it

792
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,120
to acclimate a little bit to your

793
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,278
environment and there's a there are many

794
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,519
reasons that it is more advantageous to

795
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,558
run clones as opposed to your seed mom

796
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,798
um

797
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,918
the the you lose a little bit of vigor

798
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,679
because i mean seed bombs are more

799
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,679
vigorous in clones however

800
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,679
the trade-offs are are

801
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,679
tenfold

802
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
you know not everybody wanna type but

803
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,080
not enough people want um

804
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,880
old work lines or any lines that aren't

805
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,480
hype

806
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,760
to make it matter like a lot of people i

807
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,159
get that people like it but people don't

808
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,158
spend the money they don't have a they

809
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,120
don't have a market share buying power

810
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,278
unfortunately and um if this is your

811
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,398
career and livelihood then

812
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,640
you just got to go with the flow

813
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,319
unfortunately um that's why a lot of

814
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,720
people are [ __ ] retiring a lot of

815
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,918
people from my area are [ __ ] retiring

816
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919

821
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,038

831
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
brought to the party a few years ago it

832
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,759
was good

833
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,039
is banana strains indica dumb

834
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,558
it depends on what you consider

835
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,558
independence diva those are kind of old

836
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,319
terms that that a lot of us don't use

837
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,240
anymore but we kind of have to keep

838
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,240
using because it's still common

839
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,240
nomenclature

840
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,840
it depends on what it's crossed to

841
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
obviously

842
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,599
but banana og tends to be the more

843
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,200
narrow leaf selections of o.j kush

844
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,199
because of the 60 40 in it

845
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,519
let's see

846
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,038
it's from an old man that has held onto

847
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,720
the one plant since he started growing

848
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,798
he's about 70 years old a nice cool

849
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,640
story bro are you still cool with the

850
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,759
bdsc guy [ __ ] no

851
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,600
um

852
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,879
the proof is in the pudding that that's

853
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,480
that's the dumbest [ __ ] i've ever heard

854
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,000
the proof is not in the pudding that you

855
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,440
have an original blueberry that's the

856
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,398
problem like

857
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,480
this old man told me

858
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,398
yeah you know like

859
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,640
i i would love to believe that but that

860
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,359
doesn't necessarily make it so you know

861
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,360
what i mean like

862
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,879
you know

863
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,558
um

864
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,840
i'd love to believe it

865
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,038
but it's just

866
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,000
with everybody

867
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,759
talking

868
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,278
and making up [ __ ] stories it's just

869
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,359
another story until you actually have

870
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,798
proof you know provenance is a serious

871
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,639
thing it's like saying oh i got this

872
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,798
original picasso oh yeah where'd you get

873
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,159
it from well some old man gave it to me

874
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:37,918
how do you know it's original because he

875
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,600
said proof's in the pudding you know

876
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,799
it's like what the [ __ ] are you talking

877
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,839
about

878
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,158
um

879
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,158
yeah

880
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,879
uh and i mean archive himself says that

881
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,199
that blueberry cut is midsy booth so

882
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,559
don't expect a lot of dank from it but

883
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,558
it supposedly has good blue terps

884
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,720
dj's flowers were wet basement trash

885
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,359
that's all blueberry has been from dj

886
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,278
for like [ __ ] 10 years just garbage

887
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,359
what's up vessel how you doing brother

888
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,319
how long is uh the perfect cure in your

889
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,119
opinion

890
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,359
it depends on the cut

891
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,119
a lot of the strawberry cream cuts and

892
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,038
and different phenos that came out of

893
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,639
strawberry cream and the hybrids they

894
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,519
would be

895
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,840
better

896
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,720
with less of a cure oddly enough

897
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,720
it just depends you know

898
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,880
how do you feel about the next

899
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,360
generation of growers and where the gene

900
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,840
pool is headed i mean there are some

901
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,439
next generations that are [ __ ] dudes

902
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,038
doing it right but

903
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,558
they're gonna get buried just like we

904
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,480

905

thai now in the past decade or so

927
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
for if all the old school breeders

929

even gene you know like

936
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,720
gene's doing unique stuff he's not just

937
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,919
working with with uh hype garbage

938
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,519
and

939
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,759
it's becoming more and more rare and

940
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,000
that's going to be gone soon

941
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,519
you know

942
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,599
do you really hate gelato or just hate

943
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
the hype it's it's

944
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,879
i don't mind it but i don't love it

945
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,239
because of the high it just doesn't do

946
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,398
anything for me

947
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,918
um

948
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,598
i've seen some crosses with it that are

949
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,838
beautiful and smell really good like the

950
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,800
gelato 33 gelato 45 even the 41

951
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,279
but

952
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,359
at this point everything has been done

953
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,639
and then some and now it's just constant

954
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:29,519
cookie inbreeding and that's

955
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,519
who gives a [ __ ]

956
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,639
let's see i'm way way behind sorry guys

957
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,039
my proof is in the pudding like i'm a

958
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
smoker and i could tell the difference

959
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,759
just like you can but you can tell the

960
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,039
difference that it's an original

961
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,280
blueberry

962
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,719
or

963
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
i'm not trying to be a dick but i mean

964
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,519
it's just

965
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,440
bulk claims require bold evidence you

966
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:03,119
know in anything we ufos

967
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,639
[ __ ] how long your dick is you know

968
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,320
it's just one of those things um

969
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,838
yeah i mean

970
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,838
i could smoke any number of things that

971
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,679
someone hands me randomly and just

972
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,559
i couldn't tell if it was the original

973
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,719
cut

974
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,078
especially with blueberry being that

975
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,319
you know

976
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,640
it's just one of those things dude

977
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,640
um

978
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,320
i'll tell the beauty i did tell the bdsc

979
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,320
story already um

980
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,279
because he was once a friend i don't

981
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,240
like to get too far into it

982
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
um

983
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,519
yeah i just

984
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,480
i felt very [ __ ] over i handed them a

985
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,400
company

986
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,838
i gave them every single breeder that

987
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,760
they had to start with

988
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,440
um they went there because i was there

989
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,240

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,519
looking past

996
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,119

1029
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,480
option um

1030
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,480

1038
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,960
that's my favorite

1039
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,960
she needs to be more selective what they

1040
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,000
smoke and yeah i mean but the community

1041
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,519
is very uneducated you know and and not

1042
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,639
married not talking about you guys

1043
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,599
because like everybody that comes in

1044
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,598
here

1045
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,280
more or less wants to learn like what's

1046
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,119
why things are the way they are why our

1047
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,400
scene is the way it is how it got to

1048
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,480
this point like most people are

1049
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,800
interested in history and or genetics if

1050
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
they're here uh but in generally

1051
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,079
generally speaking the guys that go into

1052
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,679
[ __ ] cookies clubs to go buy their

1053
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,359
[ __ ] weed that don't even grow

1054
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,199
they're never gonna give a [ __ ] about

1055
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,880
any of this and they drive the market

1056
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,399
they are what drives the market um

1057
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,720
they're the ones going and buying the

1058
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,639
stuff that that that growers are

1059
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,480
offloading uh they're the majority

1060
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,519
buyers and i'm not talking black market

1061
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,838

1062
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,280

1077
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,639

1078
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,319
the other person who's been selling them

1079
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,078
like from the jump

1080
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,440
popped a few seeds and [ __ ] crossed

1081
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
them and was like hey i got you know

1082
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,000
five it's original no what you got is

1083
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,159
[ __ ] two finos that you hit together

1086
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,160
for free for veterans

1087
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,160
and and that is a promise on that one

1088
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,240
we're also doing the hawaiian lights

1089
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:29,358
which is the bx to the hawaiian inside

1090
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
nl5 so instead of being like mostly nl5

1091
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,159
dominant this is going to be mostly

1092
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,440
hawaiian dominant in the nl5 so we're

1093
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,480
running through those popped all the

1094
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,240
seeds and we're going to go through all

1095
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,240
of them

1096
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,679

1100

1103
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,679

1104
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,838
not looking to sink people's businesses

1105
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,239
and and frankly they just [ __ ] me over

1106
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,358
they weren't [ __ ] other people over

1107
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,879
so

1108
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,559
i couldn't say that they were gonna [ __ ]

1109
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,200
him over i don't know that they they

1110
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,400
weren't [ __ ] anyone over it's just me

1111
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,159
because i was the one dumb enough to

1112
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,400
hand him a [ __ ] business you know

1113
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,679
that's the way it goes

1114
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,440
our ufos first ufo question from a boy

1115
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,358
are ufos real

1116
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,920
something is flying i don't know if it's

1117
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:18,159
aliens or not but something's out there

1118
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,079
um i'm sure a lot of it is us drone tech

1119
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,519
chinese drone tech russian drone tech

1120
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,519
drones have been around since world war

1121
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,599
one and a lot of people don't know that

1122
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,280
um

1123
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,800
why do you always seem to be the one on

1124
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,720
the short side of the stick but everyone

1125
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,880
seems to have the problem with you it's

1126
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,879
because i i've been

1127
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,760
stupid i've been stupid at who i've

1128
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,039
brought to our friend crew and i for

1129
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,880
every person i brought into our friend

1130
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,159
crew there's been one i've had to throw

1131
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,559
out of the friend crew for [ __ ] over

1132
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,078
the friend crew and it just is what it

1133
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,599
is not a lot of people call people out

1134
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,920
when they [ __ ] them over i just don't

1135
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,200
give a [ __ ] i'm not very edited if you

1136
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,720
haven't noticed it's just one of those

1137
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,399
things and i've made a lot of bad

1138
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,000
decisions but

1139
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,000
it's what it is you can't trust people

1140
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,400
in the [ __ ] wheat industry very few

1141
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,679
very very few um

1142
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,838
a lot of the friends that i've had in

1143
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,960
this community i've had for many many

1144
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,799
years over a decade um

1145
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,440
there's also been a lot that we've lost

1146
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,440

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,159
yet what's going on or how it's gonna

1156
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,079
continue i'm doing some stuff with

1157
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,759
shawnee kids on the canadian stuff but

1158
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,760
as far as the main

1159
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,119
main spot i'm not sure how it's going to

1160
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,680
go yet we're still trying to figure

1161
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,680
everything out

1162
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,318
uh jim ortega would be dope to talk to

1163
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,000
you but he doesn't really seem to

1164
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,440
do that swerve and skunk fear work

1165
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,639
together no

1166
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,838
i don't think so i don't want to speak

1167
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,838
for him i don't think so

1168
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,480
yeah you know and that's the thing like

1169
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,480
some of the old-schoolers like swerve

1170
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,719
swerve has been very duplicitous and a

1171
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,079
piece of [ __ ] to me specifically but i

1172
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,519
don't blame my friends that are friends

1173
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,359
with them you know like i don't give him

1174
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,239
[ __ ] for being friends with that dude

1175
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,838
like he's been nice to um cedarbury

1176
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,358
cedarburg flipped out on me for being

1177
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,078
mean to sort of it just is one of those

1178
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,078
things you know

1179
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,719

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,640
he does because that's probably one of

1185
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,000
the best

1186
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,039

um i think it could easily replace blue

1189
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,679
dream or any of that because of its

1190

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,680
dudes i know you just don't do that

1220

1221
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,599
a little [ __ ] maggot

1222
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:02,879
anyway

1223
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,519
uh

1224
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,720
how do we get in the crew

1225
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,318
i don't know we all kind of stumbled

1226
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,959
into our crew it's just we all kind of

1227
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:10,960
found each other

1228
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,480
in your podcast that the haze brothers

1229
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,598
kush has some wine in it no

1230
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,599
i don't know what's in the hayes

1231
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,079
brothers kush nobody does nobody has any

1232
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,680
clue nobody has any clue i would say

1233
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,039
probably hindu kush based but i'm not

1234
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:27,838
sure it's very early on in the 80s or

1235
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,838
yeah 80s

1236
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,079
how much variation would i find if i s1

1237
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,239
to bx f2

1238
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,800
it depends on how much work was put into

1239
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,639
the initial line it could be

1240
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,720
someone that did

1241
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,039
a back cross of an f2 that has no idea

1242
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,879
about selection and if you s1 that you

1243
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,358
may open the line i mean it's just

1244
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,559
you're going to have less phenos than in

1245
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,799
the initial px1 s2 if you just s1 it

1246
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,719
however if the line is very open you're

1247
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,400
just going to have an open line if that

1248
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:59,358
makes sense for you

1249
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,480
what would you say is the biggest

1250
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:05,358
smoking gun when it comes to ufos

1251
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,280
uh there's a few cases um

1252
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,838
the tenerife island canary islands one

1253
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,079
is very interesting there's one picture

1254
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:15,039
if i'm correct i think i'm correct on it

1255
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,119
one or two of of what was happening

1256
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,759
there were so many witnesses and it was

1257
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,480
such a extreme event that it's really

1258
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,960
hard to shut off there is the aerial

1259
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,079
school incident which i mean it's kids

1260
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,199
that witnessed it but it was a lot of

1261
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,640
kids there were a lot of different

1262
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,239
descriptions

1263
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:33,039
but overall it's very it's a very

1264
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:35,358
interesting thing it i don't really

1265
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,000
believe in mass hallucinations like that

1266
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:40,719
unless people are dosed um

1267
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,159
that's another good one um our buddy

1268
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,039
alex dietrich the the fighter pilot in

1269
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,799
um

1270
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,800
that had to do with the nimitz incident

1271
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,240
uh she's a she is actually trained in

1272
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,318
cognitive bias which is one of the

1273
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,199
reasons that i really really

1274
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:54,800
um

1275
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,799
respect her opinion on what she saw in

1276
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,800
that um

1277
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,039
that's a trippy one but

1278
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,720
you know some people are very insistent

1279
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,039
that the nimitz was was not what we

1280
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,838
thought it was but she had eyes on it

1281
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,119
you know as a as a fighter pilot uh one

1282
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,400
of the best fighter pilots that's

1283
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,400
something that's saying something

1284

because he was an [ __ ] and that was

1316
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,358
that

1317
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:26,960
seven minutes in the closet

1318
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,920
yeah selections matter very heavily and

1319
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,760
i can give an example actually from my

1320
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,358
boy bitter um

1321
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,880
the p91 s1s they were very variant um

1322
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,960
they all kind of circled around that

1323
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,559
peanut welter but there were ones that

1324
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,920
had low resin production and high resin

1325
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,480
production in just one generation uh

1326
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,480
bitter was able to make the p91 s2s

1327
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,400
actually f2rs because it was wasn't

1328
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,000
necessarily a self selection

1329
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,000
but by doing that selection he was able

1330
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,239
to make it way more resonance way more

1331
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,559
resonance and and increased how awesome

1332
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,239
that line was tenfold so

1333
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,200
yeah that's that's a perfect example of

1334
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,879
why selections matter it's it's

1335
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,759
it's the difference between playing and

1336
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,358
doing and knowing what you're doing

1337
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,640
yeah two currents is a little [ __ ]

1338
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,239
new poser who uh took a bunch of testers

1339
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,078
and made a bunch of promises he wasn't

1340
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,598
gonna use [ __ ] and then [ __ ] used it

1341
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,119
and sold it

1342
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,119
he's just a little [ __ ] coward he

1343
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,280
just started growing and immediately

1344
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,318
started selling seeds so if you all [ __ ]

1345
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,040
with him you've probably been growing

1346
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,039
longer than him

1347
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,879
la lights 1960s i believe over 30 000

1348
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,639
people saw ufo no [ __ ] i'm not familiar

1349
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,720
with that one um

1350
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:41,598
there was the uh

1351
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,199
the battle of los angeles but i don't

1352
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,880
believe there were a lot of witnesses to

1353
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,239
stuff but they were firing a lot of

1354
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,400
ammunition in the air and people died

1355
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:49,399
from it

1356
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:55,838
a ufo response vehicle what max i want

1357
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,838
pictures of this [ __ ]

1358
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,519
what traits do you focus on when you're

1359
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,039
hunting a male i don't always look for

1360
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,318
the same traits it just depends on what

1361
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,800
i'm trying to breed or what i'm trying

1362
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:08,079
to make at that specific point

1363
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,079
it's always variable

1364
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,960
muddy butthole terps yeah blue monster

1365
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,960
was the first thing i smoked when i got

1366
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,440
out of jail no anxiety and for some

1367
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,760
people blueberry is very anxious but for

1368
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,240
me it is the most anti-anxiety stuff i

1369
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,000
can smoke

1370
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,439
blueberry haze blueberry haze i mean

1371
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
that's where blue drink came from

1372
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,480
blueberry super silver haze good [ __ ]

1373
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,719
two cowards is a great name i like that

1374
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,719
name

1375
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,000
yeah i mean that's that's what most

1376
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,000
people do just get the first pheno you

1377
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,960
find

1378
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,559
with males now here's here's something

1379
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,280
here's something that a lot of people

1380
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,119
don't understand

1381
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,559
when you're selecting a male

1382
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,960
there is no

1383
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,000
real criteria that works for all males

1384
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,000
when

1385
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,519
when making hybrids it should be common

1386
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,358
sense but it's not and it wasn't to me

1387
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,039
when i first started i always use the

1388
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,598
criteria that oh i like to and this is

1389
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,719
what i was taught by by james hogg was

1390
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,559
that

1391
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,279
you look for the male that's most like

1392
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,839
the female you want to hit

1393
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,359
now does that mean

1394
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:14,799
structure a little bit like tighter node

1395
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,119
spacing

1396
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,640
uh not the first flowering all these

1397
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,079
different ideas that people put in your

1398
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,639
head over the years of what's truth and

1399
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,640
what's not um but when it comes down to

1400
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:25,440
it you don't know how a male

1401
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,920
even

1402
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,240
works or breeds until you've run the

1403
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,240
seeds that that result from it

1404
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,479
if you don't know

1405
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,679
how that male breeds

1406
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,760
then how do you even know if it's a good

1407
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:40,078
meal so all these dudes just [ __ ]

1408
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,240
smacking males [ __ ] one boom no

1409
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,920
testing throw it out there yeah this

1410
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,879
shit's dank how the [ __ ] do you know you

1411
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,079
don't even know how it breeds you don't

1412
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,920
even know if that was the best breeding

1413
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,280
male on the [ __ ] [ __ ]

1414
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,480
so

1415
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,040
you know you guys got to keep that in

1416
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,679
mind when buying seeds

1417
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,440
jonathan reed

1418
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,799
are you talking about the reed family in

1419
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,400
um

1420
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,440
massachusetts

1421
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,880
is that referring to kb

1422
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,480
breeding opposites so it's easier to

1423
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,039
separate that also is a legit way to do

1424
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,240
it if like if you if you want to to

1425
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,039
search through a line you want to see

1426
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,479
how a line breeds sometimes using a

1427
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,000
known male

1428
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,079
and crossing into something completely

1429
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,760
opposite or even just a known male like

1430
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,280
you already know how male breeds and you

1431
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,720
want to see how a female breeds use that

1432
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,160
known male because you already know how

1433
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,598
it breeds the most stuff and you can

1434
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:28,879
read it

1435
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,400
dude from seattle i have to look that

1436
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
one up i don't know why i'm not familiar

1437
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,559
with that one do you suggest taking

1438
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,079
clones for males also i do i always take

1439
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,200
gloves of my males i mean the blue

1440
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,200
bonnet male's still alive

1441
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,838
oh yeah jd jd short i will say

1442
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,000
conclusively is one of the

1443
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,039
biggest [ __ ] in our industry

1444
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,880
um

1445
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,800
dude doesn't know [ __ ] about breeding

1446
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,480
and he makes that obvious every time he

1447
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,559
[ __ ] opens his mouth

1448
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,000
um he was very fortunate that his dad

1449
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,400
made beautiful stuff so some of his

1450
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,559
stuff takes beautiful pictures um he has

1451
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,880
made stuff that could be considered good

1452
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,960
because his daddy did the work

1453
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,880
his daddy did the work in a [ __ ] tent

1454
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,519
with a one lighter

1455
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,160
popping one seed oh and

1456
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,679
so here's another here's another thing

1457
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,078
about blueberry that makes it very

1458
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,318
unique now when breeding most people

1459
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,240
breed towards certain traits

1460
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,679
most people would never take two

1461
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,118
opposite things

1462
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,719
cross them

1463
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,880
go through the next generation take two

1464
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,719
opposite things cross them go to the

1465
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,720
next generation take two opposite things

1466
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,679
cross them because you're just playing

1467
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,318
you're not you're not you're not

1468
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:38,558
breeding in any direction it is all

1469
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,400
experimentation

1470
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,800
and what can come from that could be

1471
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,639
good but that's not that's playing

1472
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,119
that's [ __ ] playing and that's what

1473
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,759
dj did in a one lighter in a closet his

1474
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,680
whole career uh until he got to

1475
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,359
switzerland of course and other people

1476
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,078
did the work there

1477
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:59,519
so and i hate you know like i respected

1478
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,599
dj for so long until i talked to dj

1479
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,599
until i talked to jay dj i met dj and

1480
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,680
got to ask dj some questions

1481
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,680
and i suggest all of you if you ever get

1482
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,519
the chance even if it's just writing a

1483
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,679
breeder and seeing what the response is

1484
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,239
to reading questions um

1485
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,679
know know the answer before you message

1486
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:16,879
them that always helps because otherwise

1487
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,239
they're just going to [ __ ] in your ear

1488
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,358
and you're going to believe it so know

1489
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:20,959
the answer

1490
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,719
but ask readers some questions hit them

1491
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,480
up see how they respond to you

1492
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,318
do they respond do they give a [ __ ]

1493
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,519
about reading they give a [ __ ] to answer

1494
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,800
your questions or they just want your

1495
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,880
money you know um

1496
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,720
ask them ask them

1497
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,480
here's here's a perfect question to ask

1498
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,239
any breeder and this will tell you

1499
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,480
everything you need to know about them

1500
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,439
everything ask them hey

1501
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,000
what from what from your line

1502
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,440
is the best for my

1503
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,280
z like meaning my arthritis for my

1504
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,000
[ __ ] hemorrhoids for my

1505
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,240
my gut problems my [ __ ]

1506
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,679
my schizophrenia ask them whatever

1507
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,000
whatever

1508
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,759
if they answer and they give you a line

1509
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,199
they are just trying to sell you [ __ ]

1510
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,280
they are just trying to sell you [ __ ]

1511
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,159
because there's no breeder on earth

1512
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,559
none

1513
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,960
no breeder on earth that could ever tell

1514
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,040
you what a specific pheno that the

1515
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,440
unpredictable specific pheno coming from

1516
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:17,440
a seed pop is ever going to do to affect

1517
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,559
your individual brain chemistry nobody

1518
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,000
can answer that

1519
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,680
nobody can and if they do they don't

1520
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,880
know what the [ __ ] they're talking about

1521
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,199
or they're lying to you and just trying

1522
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,480
to sell you seeds so yeah that's that's

1523
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:28,318
the one question everybody should be

1524
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,838
asking every breeder

1525
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,759
what's the best for my arthritis what's

1526
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,679
the best strain from you for my

1527
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,720
arthritis

1528
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:35,838
and why

1529
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,838
why is that the best strain for my

1530
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,838
arthritis

1531
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:47,440
yeah jd's guys can suck a dick i was

1532
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,280
really nice to that dude even when i um

1533
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,119
no you didn't district what's up dude

1534
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,079
nobody's asking much ufo questions only

1535
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,960
a few but um

1536
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,640
yeah

1537
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,240
i was gonna say something about jd but

1538
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,078
he's worthless to talk about so it

1539
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:01,279
doesn't really [ __ ] matter i i was

1540
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,960
kicking him lots of props during the

1541
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,880
blue bonnet thing because i felt bad

1542
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,199
because blueberry supposedly came from

1543
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,119
his dad and here i am making one of the

1544

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,559
of lone star not because of me not

1546
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,000
because of me but it is some of the best

1547
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,599
blueberry work on earth that was ever

1548
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,280
done and i knew it was going to take

1549
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,200
away from some of his money pool so i

1550
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,640
constantly plugged jd i had to repost

1551
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,639

hell yeah midwest that's that's one of

1610
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,480
the better lines like if people want

1611
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:30,000
something that will sell at collectives

1612
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,000
the gmo blueprint it's an excellent one

1613
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,798
did you tell the weight in the truck no

1614

1615
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:39,280
told her i'm going to put her in her

1616
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,839
cage

1617

1618
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:44,639
ain't that right babe

1619
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,440
she didn't answer

1620
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,519
so i can talk more [ __ ] she ain't around

1621
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,519
will [ __ ] yeah david wilcox a [ __ ]

1622
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:54,639
idiot he's he was the one who was saying

1623
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,639
he uh

1624
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:59,519
was edgar casey's reincarnation which

1625
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,719
was silly but what you know

1626
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,239
have you read any white buffalo i

1627
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,439
haven't run any of the gear but i do

1628
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:04,798
know the white buffalo guys and if

1629
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,639
you're gonna get anything from canada i

1630
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:07,838
highly recommend them

1631
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:09,519
current guess on whether we've had

1632
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,838
non-human intelligence or craft visiting

1633
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,880
clusters so most of what i've studied my

1634
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,519
whole

1635
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,960
existence uh knowing about ufos is ufo

1636
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:18,960
crash retrievals and ufo crashes

1637
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,280
at the end i shouldn't say at the end

1638
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:25,279
but where i'm currently at after years

1639

1640
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,319

1644
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,960
um

1645
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,960
there's so much cloudy misinformation

1646
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,400
put out by a select group of individuals

1647
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,079
and the same individual that's been

1648
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,079
involved with it since the

1649
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:46,400
60s via ieee and sri hall put off

1650
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,920
he's magically been in the middle of

1651
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,798
every single

1652
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,880
ufo anything any you any bad ufo event

1653
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,719
someone from hal's crew's been a part of

1654
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,838
um including dodie who is a part of

1655
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,318
house crew

1656
00:58:55,838 --> 00:59:00,159
and the aviary which is another topic

1657
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,679
for another day but

1658
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,118
um

1659
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,558
yeah i don't know i haven't seen proof

1660
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,160
for it i haven't seen proof for any

1661
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,920
crashes any of that a lot of people

1662
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:09,679
would turn to lazar and he's a [ __ ]

1663
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,519
unfortunately i as much as i used to

1664
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,358
believe lazar i've seen enough evidence

1665
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,519
now to know that he is he's at least

1666
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:17,838
very dishonest

1667
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,079
wilson davis memos i kind of go with um

1668
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,159
greenwald on this one greenwald shout

1669
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,599

from the black vault

1671
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,760
um he's done a great dissection of the

1672
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,240
wilson davis memos he's done a great

1673
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,880
dissection on the um

1674
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,798
the document nro document that was faked

1675
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,240
it was is proven to be fake and in my

1676
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,318
opinion it's been proven to be fake i've

1677
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,358
seen enough um proof that it was a fake

1678
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,519
to document and that's what all the

1679
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,039
wilson davis memo stuff is based on so

1680
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,000
if that's fake then

1681
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:48,000
you know the patreon is still going on

1682

best strawberry work i've ever seen was

1700
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,559
from cedarbury farm strawberry cream

1701
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,358
which was a

1702
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,880
uh

1703
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,159
a worked version of strawberry cough

1704
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,798
russia has crashed they might have

1705
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,639
crashed ufos they might but russia was

1706
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,039
so locked down and so hard to get info

1707
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,279
out of i do have books on specifically

1708

if you haven't read any chocolate stuff

1712
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,079

1713
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,880
the ufo field um do i have any right

1714

i didn't bring any with me over here

1716
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,039
i read like five or six books at a time

1717
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,798
because i have adhd and i have to do

1718
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,199
stuff like that this is another one i'm

1719
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,838
revisiting john alexander another aviary

1720
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:07,279
member um ufos missed conspiracies and

1721
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:09,119
realities it's very good um

1722
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,359
he's been he's been deep in that that

1723
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,400
hell put off crew for a long time too

1724
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,000
so

1725
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,000
he has very good insights to stuff

1726
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,920
there's also some other books that a lot

1727
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,798
of people don't look at very often but

1728
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,480
should be

1729
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,880
uh talked about in like the william

1730
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,079
corliss stuff um

1731
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,640
this one he did a lot of stuff on the

1732
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,680
mysterious universe like so basically

1733
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:33,118
any anomalies whether it's human ancient

1734
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,719
uh astronomical light anomalies

1735
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,838
so yeah i highly recommend that stuff

1736
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,598
too

1737
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,039
what region did your afghani heirloom

1738
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,798
come from i don't know that came from a

1739
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,039
dude named bite me that was on the mr

1740
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,798
nice forums and i'm guessing it's

1741
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,880
probably just a super skunk hybrid of

1742
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,880
some sort so it's probably not a land

1743
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,798
race um but it would be an heirloom

1744
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,680
because it was from the early 90s it

1745
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:55,280
would be considered an airline

1746
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:56,879
let's see

1747
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,680
if you're not non-human do you think the

1748
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,240
smoke is black tech or have we haven't

1749
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,879
we seen thoughts on tic tac

1750
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,919
so one of my one of my buddies was one

1751
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:10,160
of the people who put eyes on tic tac

1752
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,318
i i do i can't discount her i can't

1753
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,879
discount her opinion on what she saw at

1754
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:17,920
all i do think a lot of these anomalies

1755
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:21,039
are drone tech our own or otherwise

1756
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,639
but i i don't know on that specific one

1757
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,000
have you smoked the strawberry banana

1758
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,879

1759
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,119
what

1760
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,519
strawberry been what you see me smoking

1761

1768
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:53,759
gave my grandma havana syndrome i've

1769
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,760
been running the microwave all night

1770
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,119
heating up hot pockets i've been looking

1771
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,880
into the havana syndrome it's very

1772
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,079
interesting there's some some great old

1773
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,079
work um

1774
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,079
there's a book called project camellio

1775
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,240
not chameleon but camillo

1776
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,559
um

1777
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,719
it's it's it's pretty fascinating and

1778
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,319
and it might have something to do with

1779
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,239
the havana syndrome

1780
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,798
it's more about us using the tech on

1781
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:19,679
civilians than anything

1782
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:24,079

1784
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,200

lebanese lebanese cush that i grew that

1790
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:41,199
came from a collective

1791
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:43,759
it was

1792
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,399
a long gorilla arm type narrow leaf

1793
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,880
dominant plant but it finished in seven

1794
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,358
weeks and smoked super cushy it was the

1798
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,838
honest with you but it did fit a lot of

1799
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:00,480

a lot of my hashtags have been [ __ ]

1871
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,480

01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,039
submission which is possible

1879
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,318
but diaz is [ __ ]

1880
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,640

1922
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,639

1928
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,039
know how long or when they're gonna go

1929
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,798
up front but they will be eventually up

1930
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,640
front

1931
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,880
of any strains being released that dump

1932
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,679
and hash the whole bonnet line was made

1933
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,400
to be a hash dumper um

1934
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:05,039
i mean pretty much anyone who's who's

1935
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,719
working lines now breeds for hash

1936
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,479
because it's just such a major part of

1937
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,079
everything

1938
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,678
some of my recommendations on strains

1939
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,679
that dump hash

1940
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,960
but it just i would first ask what what

1941
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,920
are some of your favorite strains to

1942
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,279
smoke

1943
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,880
that you like

1944
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,520
that you like to wash and then i would

1945
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,159
pick one based on that

1946
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,000
because there's so many different ones

1947
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,318
i mean we've been breeding for for hash

1948
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
trains long before bonnet but um i think

1949
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,560
bonnet's been the most consistently

1950
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,158
awesome for washing

1951
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,960
i mean the gmo bonnet would be a quick

1952
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:38,559
pick that's obvious um

1953
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,759
the bubble berries been [ __ ] awesome

1954
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:44,960
for washing um

1955
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,960
a wipe on it of course

1956
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:51,519
um the trademark chad has been [ __ ]

1957
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,520
surprisingly awesome but that's because

1958
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,679
it has a lot of torpedolin qualities to

1959
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,679
it

1960
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,560
auction yeah my last options didn't go

2126
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,280

2127
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,039
listened to me nobody listened to me on

2128
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,559
that everybody wanted to [ __ ]

2129
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:56,319
get their hands on that [ __ ] like it was

2130
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,719
something new even though you could get

2131
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,039
any blackberry or any mendo perps hybrid

2132
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,960
it would look like that and be better

2133
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:04,560
but you know it is what it is

2134
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,920
people people are at all different

2135

with the ewoks

2154

2171
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,840
look like an ewok so

2172
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:26,559
she called me a kindred spirit to a

2173
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,560
[ __ ] ewok

2174

2176
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,000
i mean

2177
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:43,519
i eventually will go back and watch star

2178
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,359
wars maybe

2179
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,840
i just had friends that were such like

2180
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:49,839
extreme star wars dorks that i was like

2181
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,039
[ __ ] you i'm never watching that and

2182
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,800
yeah i do watch the dark side of the

2183
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,158
ring though i do like those vice

2184
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,520
documentaries on wrestling there have

2185
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:56,879
been some great ones

2186
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,159
talking about a lot of the stuff that

2187
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,679
that hasn't really been talked about

2188
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:00,719
much outside of books i think that's

2189
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,560
pretty cool

2190
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,719
and podcasts obviously talk about some

2191
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,560
of like the bruiser brody stuff and

2192
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:09,439
shoot interviews and [ __ ] but yeah dark

2193
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,679
sides ring has been good

2194
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:13,678
x-files best show ever maybe one of the

2195
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,840
best i will agree with that i'm a major

2196
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,239
x-files nerd i still have the original

2197
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,159
x-files box set from the very when they

2198
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,678
finished the very last season

2199
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:22,799
right there in front of me and i'll

2200
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,800
never get rid of it even though it's

2201
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,400
dvds

2202
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,000
what's your take on bill cooper he

2203
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:30,559
exposed a lot of these ufo researchers

2204
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,880
long ago bill cooper was busy

2205
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,800
selling out the ufo community while

2206
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,039
doing that he was working closely with

2207
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,039
dodie and other uh

2208
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:41,279
intelligence fools

2209
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:43,840
selling out people in the community in

2210
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:44,880
trade for getting real info which he got

2211
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,279
none of

2212
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,279
um

2213
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:50,799
he's a very controversial polarizing

2214
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,480
type character in the ufo community

2215
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,239
however i think he's been gone long

2216
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,158
enough that it would be very interesting

2217
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:57,359
to talk to him now i would love to talk

2218
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:59,359
to bill moore now and see where his

2219
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:01,279
head's at with everything after having

2220
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,198
you know a good 20 years out of the

2221
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:05,519
community to sit and ponder on how

2222
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:07,759
everything went down

2223
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,840
can you shed lime light on informants in

2224
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,039
the industry

2225
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,800
well i mean

2226
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:14,319
i don't know whose actual informants i

2227
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,719
know there have been people that put

2228
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:19,279
down paperwork threatening to inform

2229
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:22,319
um i've talked about them a lot since i

2230
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:24,158
was involved in some of that but um

2231
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:25,439
actual informants

2232
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:27,279
nobody knows who they'd be or they

2233
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,198
wouldn't be breathing it just is what it

2234
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:31,119
is this might sound basic but over time

2235
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:33,919
some of my favorite strains for that

2236
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:35,599

2249
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,520
one of my favorite people to listen to

2250
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:04,960
and ponder on when i was a young kid up

2251
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,480
until i was an adult

2252

and there's been enough stuff put out

2253
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,879
ever since jeremy corbell started

2254

01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:34,079
if he's gained nothing

2321
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,800

2333
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:03,519
can see it

2334
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,839
after after bob lazar

2335
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,239
got kind of shaken up by his whole

2336
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,760
[ __ ] ufo fraud [ __ ] he started

running a whorehouse with him at him

2338
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,280

you know

2342
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,520
whatever but the thing i would judge on

2343
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,439
is the fact that he got caught

2344
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:24,400
installing [ __ ] video cameras in the

2345
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:26,000
room to blackmail the johns so

2346
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,000
the type of person that would do stuff

2347
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,399
like that

2348
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,158

2349
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:35,679
made that money back in the 90s with the

2350
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:38,079
testers corporate or uh early 2000s late

2351
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,000
90s with the testers corporation uh the

2352
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:42,639
movie license deals those are very early

2353
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,520
on that is nothing recent um

2354
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:47,679
it is a long [ __ ] con job

2355
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,840

01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:00,238
between cie and the hippie mafia

2360
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:01,839

2363
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:07,678
really fascinating

2364
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:09,119
what is my favorite bubba cut that's

2365
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,679
still possible that is possible to get

2366
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:14,840
stall uh bubba

2367
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:17,840
that's my favorite public cut bubba

2368
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:20,079
um bubba

2369
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,400
he is very believable i agree he had me

2370
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,639
sold for until the last year and a half

2371
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:26,079
or so uh that's when i started really

2372
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,920
and the reason i didn't like looking

2373
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:29,920
into bob lazar i did not want to find

2374
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,399
out he was a liar i did not want to find

2375
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,319
out that [ __ ] lied um

2376
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:37,119
i had believed him since i was in my

2377
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:40,000
teens early teens

2378
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:41,760
so when i found out he was a lie or

2379
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,198
when i started looking into it i was

2380
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,880
looking into it to prove he wasn't a

2381
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:47,359
liar

2382
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,359
and he was a [ __ ] liar that's always

2383
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:52,000
do it he has lied about so many things

2384
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:53,519
that have to do with that case um

2385
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,800
and we know that there was someone that

2386
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,639
worked

2387
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,800
actually let me let me bring it back he

2388
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,960
is not lying about working at area 51 he

2389
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,520
is lying about working at s4 he is lying

2390
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:06,319
about that part he fixed the the

2391
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,400
radiation badge detectors and would scan

2392
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,599
them at area 51.

2393
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:10,960
that's what we know he actually did

2394
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,239
there he did not

2395
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,039
do any reverse engineering no propulsion

2396
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:17,039
nothing like that

2397
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,520
yeah it was heartbreaking to learn that

2398
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:26,800
about him it really was i mean i i i'm

2399

2410
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,119
and those are available too

2411
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:57,520

2413
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,360
to find a lot of people lied about using

2414
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,560
it

2415
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:04,079

2417
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,559

2419
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:13,920

2421
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,000

2430
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,039
bob's ufo hookers

2431
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,440
vision

2432
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:51,198
what's up brother how is heirloom

2433
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,799
different than land race genetics land

2434
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:54,399
race implies that it has not been worked

2435
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,480
by man heirloom implies that it's been

2436
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:57,759
working by man but you know it's been

2437
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:58,879
around long enough to be considered an

2438
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,360
heirloom

2439
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,639
but land race is is

2440
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:05,198
in nature

2441
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,639
where is grown you know like where it

2442
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:07,678
naturally forms so there's not such

2443
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,520
there's no such thing as a north

2444
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,199
american land race no such thing as a

2445
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,360
south american land race but there are

2446
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:15,678
heirloom lines from south america there

2447
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:16,880
are heirloom hemp lines in the us and i

2448
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,239
think it's been long enough to call

2449
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,119
certain lines like super skunk that have

2450
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:22,638
been here since 1990. um

2451
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,158
that's a long time now it's like 30

2452
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,119
years i think that is

2453
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,399
heirloom status but uh land races is a

2454
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:30,479
whole different

2455
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,839
term

2456
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,919
yeah the bubba cut that we had in san

2457
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,400
diego is [ __ ] fire that's the one

2458
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,679
that we always call pre-98 um i'm not

2459
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:39,920
sure if that is the same cut as the

2460
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,600
bubba like the csi uses i've had them in

2461
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,679
the same room at the same time and they

2462
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,960
grow very similar

2463
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,119
bubba is one of those things that breed

2464
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:50,319
so true and it's very hard to tell if

2465
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:53,198
one's a hybrid of the other you know

2466
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:55,439
is cherry aka branchy

2467
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:56,559
um you can make it branchy but not just

2468
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,638
thinking about it right now it's not

2469
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,400
terribly branchy

2470
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,079
has great structure i still find ancient

2471
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:03,920
aliens a great tv show so many facts

2472
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:06,559
about ancient astronauts today i can't

2473
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,480
watch ancient aliens i get too mad um

2474
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,480
some of my friends are on it on ancient

2475
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:12,559
aliens and we all give them [ __ ] for it

2476
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,799
but um

2477
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,480
you know there has been decent true

2478
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,039
stuff talked about on ancient aliens but

2479
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:20,079
between david hatcher childress jason

2480
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:22,479
martell

2481
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,800
[ __ ] giorgio sokolos those guys are

2482
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:26,879
so full of [ __ ] david wilcock one of the

2483
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,960
most full of [ __ ] [ __ ] ever um

2484
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,400
cory good all those dudes all bad all

2485
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,399
bad so

2486
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:34,799
to you have to watch a full episode to

2487
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:37,599
maybe get two minutes of real content or

2488
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,960
anything that's remotely factual but to

2489
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,719
if you smoke and watch it it's pretty

2490
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,439
fun right

2491
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:47,039
csi is 707 he told me then i know of

2492
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:49,839
katsu and pre-98 so the original cut

2493
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,920
from shaw would be pre-98

2494
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,679
but there was another cut i think in

2495
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,399
socal that was also passed around as

2496
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:58,639
pre-98 shah's bubba is the bubba kush

2497
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:58,638
though

2498
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:03,039
but they might be the same it might be

2499
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,480
the same as the 398 cut um it's just one

2500
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:06,479
of those things with microclimates and

2501
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:08,638
climates and how things change and how

2502
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:11,439
things express they are so similar it's

2503
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:13,199
very hard to know if if the pre-98 the

2504
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:15,359
socal pre-98 and shaw's bubba are the

2505
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:15,359
same

2506
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,920
let's see

2507
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:28,238
cats cats is a [ __ ]

2508
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,238
joke of a human being i'm sorry i mean

2509
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:31,678
he's a nice guy

2510
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:33,678
but

2511
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,840
with that said nice guys make bad

2512
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,199
decisions and

2513
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,360
when he bothered the [ __ ] out of me and

2514
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:40,960
blew up my phone to get cuts when he

2515
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:42,559
first started to want to come back and

2516
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,679
grow because he hadn't been growing the

2517
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,600
whole time

2518
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,119
um and he wanted him to start his first

2519
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,400
breeding projects because he said he

2520
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:50,079
could make money off his name because

2521
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:53,279
people think he was a breeder because he

2522
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:56,158
passed cuts that's when i was like oh

2523
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:57,679
this guy's a [ __ ] bag

2524
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:58,879
that's what you call exploiting a

2525
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,920
community

2526
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,440
um

2527
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:04,000
and he is happy to have people believe

2528
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:05,678
he was a breeder he was not a breeder he

2529
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,238
passed cuts

2530
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,119
he he bought expensive seeds and passed

2531
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:10,879
a cut

2532
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:12,319
and left the community not long

2533
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,319
thereafter

2534
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:17,319
so

2535
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,319
yeah

2536
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:23,679
it's just one of those things

2537
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,719
uh i i hate to be a dick about it but

2538
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,000
it's just

2539
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,439
i have no edit button so that's just

2540
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,639
what's gonna happen i'm a dick what can

2541
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:32,960
i say what can i [ __ ] say

2542
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:37,039
i did give him a cut though

2543
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,039
i did give him math one um

2544
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,440
definitely not a breeder but now he says

2545
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:45,279
he is and people sell his [ __ ] like he

2546
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:49,238
is and he was trying to have everyone

2547
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,238
make the seeds for him

2548
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,639
yeah yeah

2549
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:02,319
i don't know about that about ghost

2550
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,840
giving him his bubba it might be i don't

2551
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:05,920

tons a lot of people are using it in

2555
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,560
their lines a lot of people have renamed

2556
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,400
it to use it in their lines

2557
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,480
but not a lot of people can afford it

2558
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:18,638
and is what it is

2559
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:20,238

01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:57,840
[Music]

2574
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,840
yeah people are breeders like the

2575
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,600
drunkards now that's not ever going to

2576
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,440
change

2577
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,039
i mean i but in reality i'm not much of

2578
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,439
a breeder anymore like i don't work

2579
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,760
lines anymore it's i haven't worked like

2580
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:15,039
steadily worked a line to like [ __ ]

2581
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:15,039
past f3 4 or b x 2 3 in

2582
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,359
a decade maybe like it's been a long

2583
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,520
time so i can't even call myself a

2584
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:23,920
breeder really like i'm not anymore i

2585
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,840
don't do that can't do that

2586
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,119
i'd be

2587
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:29,600
homeless what's good about trinity are

2588
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:32,079
there a few there so the trinity that's

2589
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,320
out there we don't have any kind of

2590
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:36,399
verification or validation on from the

2591
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:38,319
old trinity crew so i mean

2592
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:40,238
and technically the trinity cup we all

2593
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,799
use as an imposter but we try to be very

2594
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:42,799
clear about that

2595
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:49,439
canivore says katsu bought his bubba cut

2596
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,000
from the green crack man

2597
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:53,678
in the early 2000s supposedly comes from

2598
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,319
oregon kid that there you go that's the

2599
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,639
story that's the story he is correct

2600
01:32:56,319 --> 01:33:00,799
are you still doing skittles work um not

2601
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:02,639
the moment no

2602
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:05,279
did it early on

2603
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,960
um it's not my favorite breeder

2604
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:08,238
it's not bad but it's not my favorite it

2605
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,920
was less consistent than i would have

2606

2769
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,239
liar and he he just

2770
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,279
he said they were homies him and csi are

2771
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:45,439

2772

holy [ __ ] i'm sure cs i'll love to hear

2773
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:47,678
that

2774
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:50,719
what's the phallus funkiest blueberry

2775
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:53,199
cross you have um right now the funkiest

2776
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,800
would definitely be the blue baby [ __ ]

2777
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:56,399
that's why it has the name

2778
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,400
the collab with lupa you did the

2779
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,920
raspberry headband any info on what to

2780
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,920
look for in the pack um

2781
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,760
calling that a collab was a stretch it

2782
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,359
was called a collab because i wanted to

2783
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,639
give lumpus some money but in order to

2784
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:09,759
do that

2785
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,359
to sell through his people he had to

2786
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,960
have his name on it

2787
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:14,719
um

2788
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,000
with that said there's a lot of day

2789
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,760
record type stuff there's a lot of cam

2790
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,198
91 type stuff and there's a lot of og

2791
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,800
type stuff in there it's all over the

2792
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:24,319
place with that

2793
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,760
thoughts on mr bobham pill

2794
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:27,679
he calls himself the librarian dude some

2795
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,679
of my friends like him most people know

2796
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:31,279
he's full of [ __ ] but

2797
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,000
a lot of them say he's harmless but i

2798
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:33,920
mean

2799
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,039
if you're selling [ __ ] lines that are

2800
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,960
fake

2801
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:38,560
and you don't know that they are what

2802
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,679
you say they are you're kind of a [ __ ]

2803
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,520
bag especially if you're presenting

2804
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,920
yourself as a librarian so that's all i

2805
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,360
got to say about that um

2806
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,399
he was a [ __ ] back to one of my best

2807
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:48,079
friends probably one of the nicest

2808
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:49,118
people i know in mad elite

2809
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:51,279
um

2810
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:52,799
i do not and will not ever have anything

2811
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:54,479
good to say about bob hamphill there's

2812
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,560
just not like i've watched him do [ __ ]

2813
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:57,919
bag things he traded a bunch of cuts he

2814
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,000
had that he wasn't supposed to [ __ ]

2815
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,719
trade to a little fraud named nature

2816
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,520
farmer and

2817
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:06,960
that was that i mean

2818
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,400
if you're in any of these old circles

2819
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,000
you only get in those old circles with

2820
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,399
those old cuts because people trust you

2821
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,800
enough to be there and when you

2822
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:17,198
disrespect that you are pushed out of

2823
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,360
the circles

2824
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:20,719
simple as that

2825
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:22,399
do you think the cannabis community

2826
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:24,560
should create a jockey club to protect

2827
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:27,118
readers and the industry

2828
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,360
i don't know what that is

2829
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:31,118
doesn't skunk tech i gave skunk tech day

2830
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:32,319
wrecker unfortunately

2831
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,399
um

2832
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:36,079
yeah

2833
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:38,559
i don't know if he still has it but yeah

2834
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,000
i gave it to him

2835
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,199
he says he has original diesel from

2836
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,639
someone else

2837
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:44,158
um but i did give him the original

2838
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:45,840
diesel day record cut i don't know if he

2839
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:48,839
considers the other original diesel more

2840
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,520
real than the actual one

2841
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:55,440
but who knows i mean the guy's a [ __ ]

2842
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,440
squid so take it for what it's worth

2843
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:00,079
there's a lot of squids in the industry

2844
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:01,599
it just is what it is if you're in the

2845
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:03,359
industry and you interact with a lot of

2846
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,360
people you're going to interact with a

2847
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:06,960
lot of squids a lot of people that are

2848
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:08,479
not

2849
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,239
decent human beings

2850
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:12,638
um the director's still in the circle

2851
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:14,399
yes the record is still in the circle

2852
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,239
we have the blue wrecker which is the

2853
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:17,759
day record blue bonnet which is a very

2854
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:19,198
good regular seed version of the day

2855
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,119
record because blue bonnet doesn't

2856
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:23,519
impart many blueberry traits it really

2857
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:26,000
mostly imparts heavier resin production

2858
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,159
better structure and

2859
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,560
shorter flowering

2860
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:30,559
stuff like

2861
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:35,199
that yeah nobody's going to say anything

2862
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:39,039
bad about csi or scuffy i love skunk va

2863
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:41,198
that dude's as legit as they come um csi

2864
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:42,880
i'm biased that's one of my best friends

2865
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:44,319
on earth so

2866
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,039
i couldn't say anything bad about him

2867
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:48,960
but even if even if he wasn't even even

2868
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:50,880
when we weren't friendly i still had

2869
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,880
nothing bad to say about him and i

2870
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,960
always looked up to him

2871
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,800
so yeah

2872
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,760
same with bodhi you if someone says

2873
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,119
something bad about buddy there's

2874
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,639
something wrong with them

2875
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:02,000
now someone said something bad about me

2876
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:04,560
probably true

2877
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,920
and um

2878
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,080
probably not the whole truth that's

2879
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,399
probably way meaner than they say but if

2880
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,000
they say i'm a liar or a thief then

2881
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:13,759
that's different

2882
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,118
if they say i'm an [ __ ] probably true

2883
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,600
probably true i probably said something

2884
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:17,599
real mean

2885
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:24,079
yeah skunky is a great dude

2886
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:26,479
yeah he's been cool to me when he never

2887
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,840
had to be

2888
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:29,118
green mountain take some pics how are

2889
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,199
you liking them uh what are the terps

2890
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:33,599
like that that you found in your uh blue

2891
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:33,599
records

2892
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,319
uh with that said you got to remember

2893
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,039
this i'm just one perspective never take

2894
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:46,238
anything i say for [ __ ] 100

2895
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:48,560
true because truth lies in perspective

2896
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:51,118
you know um so

2897
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:52,880
to do some investigating you know like

2898
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,479
make sure that what i'm saying is true

2899
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,800
i'm not always right

2900
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:59,678
um but if i'm saying it i at least have

2901
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,880
done the research and think i'm right

2902
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:02,480
um

2903
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,960
yeah csi has a wealth of knowledge a lot

2904
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:07,359
of a lot of stuff that that i know has

2905
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,480
been passed down by people like him or

2906
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:09,679
him

2907
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:10,799
um

2908
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:12,960
so you just look at me like a

2909
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,639
regurgitator i'm not that smart myself

2910

now um

2938
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:21,279
uh out of what's currently available i

2939
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:23,679
did a lot of

2940
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:24,800
uh broad leaf work

2941
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:27,359
whereas

2942
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:30,480
prior almost everything i was doing was

2943
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:33,039
uh narrow leaf dominant sativa dominant

2944
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:34,718
done at 50 days dude original well i

2945
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:36,319
guess it's not an original diesel funo

2946
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,600
so it's not like having original diesel

2947
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:40,399
come down in 50 days but that's pretty

2948
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,840
awesome dude yeah

2949
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:44,479
that's one of one of the highlights of

2950
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,800
blueberries how far down it can bring um

2951
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:49,198
flowering times there's some great gmo

2952
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,440
dominant looking smelling plants in the

2953
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:54,799
the gmo bluebonnet cross that come down

2954
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:56,960

2955
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,800
