1
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,079
so

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,480
what up everyone

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
how y'all doing

4
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,718
all right let's get this [ __ ] set right

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
it's gonna start a little early just to

6
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,480
see if we can get everybody joined in by

7
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,479
actual 6 p.m

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
god this is just so [ __ ] scary and

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,558
ugly every time i look at it i think of

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,478
it like a michael myers head but i'm

11
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,719
pretty sure it's a trump head

12
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,879
hey um speakeasy can you do me a favor

13
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,798
and via patreon let everybody know that

14
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,759
it's about to start on ig so they have

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,760
it i forgot to do that first

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,158
yep

17
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,520
i'll just sit here like this until it's

18
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,519
time to

19
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,519
rock

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
get my hair combed right

21
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,438
it's looking good

22
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
looking good

23
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,920
damn that's hard to get off

24
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
that big [ __ ] head

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,560
it looks like ric flair

26
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,560
yeah anyway

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
hopefully more people show up so we can

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,039
actually give a nice treatise on the

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,360
past present

30
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,359
um

31
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,239
future maybe i don't know if we can talk

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
about the future of clone trading clone

33
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
collecting i've talked about it a little

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,479
bit recently

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,598
uh um

36
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,119
about

37
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,119
a little bit of where people are that

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
have a lot of these strains archived

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
that are

40
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
rare and old and

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
special

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
but um

43
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,159
i don't think i've really given a full

44
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,878
long

45
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,479
tail of how it kind of how it developed

46
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,079
over time

47
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,000
how it was when we were breaking into

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
the scene like how one would even go

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,039
about

50
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,400
um collecting clones in the first place

51
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,519
because obviously you know a lot of it's

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
trading

53
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
and not everybody has something to trade

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,239
at the beginning

55
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,239
uh we'll talk about clone circles

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,280
yeah i gotta give myself the own crouch

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
here

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
but until we start that anybody have any

59
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,799
questions yet

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
anything you want me to touch on so i

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
don't forget

62
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,318
anything

63
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,199
clown hoarding

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
i could talk about clown hoarding

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,759
there's plenty of clowns hoarding in the

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
seed industry oh my god today there it

67
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,518
is

68
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,919
yeah clown whoring

69
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,360
you could do that too

70
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,679
clown whoring

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
those bastards clowns are always whoring

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
around

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,039
clone people

74
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,039
well this is about clone people

75
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,639
i mean really it's but going to the

76
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,399
theory of it should

77
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,199
ben sherman full you know

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
you know how i roll clay um

79
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,839
yeah i mean

80
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,000
it's all the same theory right like you

81
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,198
can you can take a theory and apply it

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,160
to

83
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
fools

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
it's very easy to do so hopefully you

85
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
guys can use some critical thinking and

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
apply it so i don't have to go and go

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
and go over every single dip [ __ ] that's

88
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,679
pretending to be in circles you know

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
it's it's a lot easier just to explain

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,840
it

91
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,439
before you know what it is or on a reveg

92
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,359
oh i'm not doing cloning um

93
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,360
tips and tricks but i mean just for that

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
quick one sometimes it's better to take

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,199
it on a re-veg sometimes it's better to

96
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,799
take it beforehand sometimes things root

97
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,160
easier after a re-veg so yeah

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,360
this is george

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
george from walmart

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,120
okay

101
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,758
i think at 80 we can be close enough to

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
start this [ __ ] all right

103
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
so back in the day

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
clones weren't really a big thing a lot

105
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,959
of a lot of a lot of people were using

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
seeds when i say back in the day i'm

107
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,359
talking you know 70s 60s

108
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,439
on through the 80s up until the 90s

109
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,520
clones weren't the the primary source

110
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,519
for people to be passing genetics most

111
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,959
of it was done in seed form that's how a

112
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,839
lot of this started

113
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,038
on in through when you get up into

114
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,478
maybe like the northern lights area

115
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,240
would be a good example

116
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,319
of

117
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
how of how people started getting in

118
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,439
these circles that had certain genetics

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
and were keeping them very tight and

120
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,719
only passing it to people in their

121
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
circles and trusted people and that all

122
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,320
kind of started because you know there

123
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,159
were different people in each market and

124
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,079
giving someone a special clone that was

125
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,000
considered elite at the time and the

126
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,839
definition of elite back then is a lot

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
different than now that is definitely

128
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,439
morphed but you didn't want to give

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,560
someone in the same

130
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,800
area as you the same exact clone

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,879
if it was super special because they'd

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
be knocking into your market and and you

133
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,439
guys would end up competing with each

134
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,758
other so you basically set yourself up

135
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,038
to be competed against so a lot of times

136
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,639
when clones were shared they were they

137
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,079
were shared in different markets but

138
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,000
there were also clone crews that were

139
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,839
pushing out tons of weight and all

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,759
pushing each other to to brand a

141
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,439
particular line kind of like the

142
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,280
northern light stuff

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,279
as you got into online

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,679
uh when overgrow was popping up and all

145
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,559
that you had a lot of people

146
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,319
that had amassed these small

147
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,240
little collections of clones during that

148
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
time some bigger than others but a lot

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
of them would amass these small clone

150
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,159
collections and um

151
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,879
provenance wasn't as much as a serious

152
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,639
thing back then

153
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,038
i see you saying clone hoarding over and

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,519
over and that's i'll get to it dude i'll

155
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,120
get to it for you um

156
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,198
but you see these people messy small

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,038
collections and as they would speak they

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,038
would learn to trust who was going to

159
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,478
keep their word on not passing said

160
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,318
clones and making it back into their

161
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,240
market and some people would just take

162
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,160
the clones and run and do their own

163
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,478
thing rename it pretend like it's a new

164
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,560
thing and that's how we get to today

165
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,719
so as i entered

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,598
i wasn't i didn't have special stuff but

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,319
i was in california and unfortunately

168
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,038
there were a few places uh

169
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,360
what's the the best one i found was pnc

170
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,519
it was a dude named ape and i would say

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,360
at least 80 plus of his of his things

172
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,839
were legit sourced he was a stray nerd

173
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,919
like a lot of us are still today and he

174
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,719
did some pretty good sourcing of a lot

175
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,439
of og cuts pure cushes

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
um purples back then he did a really

177
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,360
good job sourcing i was just fortunate

178
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,638
to be in that area i also had a clone

179
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,439
crew that we were a part of with the

180
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,120
hogs breath crew and in that circle

181
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,639
people were allowed to have the cut we

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,399
weren't allowed to compete we weren't

183
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
allowed to

184
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,799
share and that was

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
that was super important we weren't

186
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
allowed to share with people outside the

187
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,079
group and that's how you ended up with

188
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,319
people like

189
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,120
you know the p91 crew the hogs breath

190
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,240
crew the bull rider crew uh you ended up

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
with all these different crews with

192
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
their one specific cut and this is kind

193
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,919
of before the og cush craze when all

194
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,918
that was going on once og kush hit it

195
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,560
was

196
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,799
it was a lot of fronting

197
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,759
a lot of pretending

198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,720
a lot of fake sourcing and it got really

199
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,560
bad and and as the online market

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,520
the online forums kind of blew up it

201
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,879
started to get more and more permeated

202
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,478
and a lot harder to verify sources

203
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,759
now most of the people that take this

204
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,639
seriously

205
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,439
take

206
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,360
provenance seriously in the first place

207
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,120
and when i say provenance i don't mean

208
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
anything more than

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,679
like like the term applies to art if you

210
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,679
if you have a painting that you have and

211
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,719
it's signed by someone if you can't

212
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,519
prove

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,160
where you got it from back to the artist

214
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
you've lost the provenance and therefore

215
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,639
it loses value

216
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,040
right

217
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,958
so with clones it's very much the same

218
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,838
thing you could say i got this clone

219
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:10,879
from xyz but nobody knows how xyz got

220
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,240
that clone at that point it's broken and

221
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,439
people who are super serious about it

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,759
don't really want to trade with you and

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,080
they don't want to get in on it you know

224
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,080
um

225
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,439
so now we go to today

226
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,439
the trust in the market

227
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
is is all but gone

228
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
uh

229
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,639
people today tend to have popped up in

230
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,278
the last few years that are big in the

231
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,519
uh clone trading scene that i'm noticing

232
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,799
that keep having the same mistakes

233
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,639
and it's because they're trading with

234
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,479
people that are new to the scene too but

235
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,399
have them convinced that they are legit

236
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
and connected to this guy or this guy or

237
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,200
this guy or this guy when it comes to me

238
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,639
and in my friends we all know who we've

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
given clones to and who those people

240
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,439
have given clones to for the most part

241
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,200
there's always going to be exceptions to

242
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,080
the rule but for the most part we know

243
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,240
who has what clone of old [ __ ] who has

244
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,440
given it who had permission to get it

245
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
who didn't

246
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
all of the above and this still exists

247
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,359
this is still a [ __ ] thing

248
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,439
and people around

249
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,039
selling clones online

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,079
aren't a part of that those circles

251
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,319
they're not

252
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,838
they never they never were any of those

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
people selling clones online like that

254
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,360
with their big ass list like hey i got

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
all these [ __ ] clones [ __ ] source

256
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,959
from the breeder cut lovely these guys

257
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,399
are not people that would ever be

258
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,159
trusted with clones in the first place

259
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
from any of our circles not my circle

260
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,039
not the other circles that are old that

261
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,320
i'm not even a part of

262
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,000
no one's gonna trust these dudes with

263
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
[ __ ] um

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
and that's where i'm seeing a lot of the

265
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
problems arise

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
check out your only radio ridge does

267
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,799
have a great only fans he's got this

268
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,159
great picture of his testicle amazing do

269
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,439
you know any verified cuts that look

270
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,879
distinctly different than in his

271
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
pictures so

272
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,799
we get to the next topic verifying cuts

273
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
through pictures

274
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,159
there are a million reasons why this

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
can't and shouldn't be done and why you

276
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,559
don't see guys like me and inspector and

277
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,919
everyone trying to verify clones through

278
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,319
pictures

279
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,000
expressions and micro like in micro

280
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
climates and expressions things can look

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,159
totally different totally [ __ ]

282
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,759
different however there are a few cuts

283
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:11,439
that have certain traits that we know

284
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,879
always occur no matter what the uh

285
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,640
what the what the

286
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,639
expression is there are certain traits

287
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,879
that always pop out of certain clones

288
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,879
um

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,759
the point being

290
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
you guys

291
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,240
the best advice i could ever give anyone

292
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
is if you want to buy spend money on a

293
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,000
clone from someone chase that [ __ ] all

294
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,519
the way back to the breeder they should

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
be able to do that if they can't do that

296
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
then there's an issue

297
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,440
don't just take their word for it

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,759
because i've seen people saying some

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
wild [ __ ] [ __ ] that they're getting

300
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,720
past

301
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,399
chem 91 directly from a certain source

302
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,759
that didn't happen couldn't happen it

303
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,039
doesn't happen

304
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,120
um

305
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,799
and and it's it's sometimes it's hard to

306
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,278
get those answers but if you can't get

307
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,278
the answer then it's not worth getting

308
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,559
because every time i'm seeing people get

309
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,799
screwed

310
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,599
every time they go buy clones from these

311
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,519
doofuses they get screwed

312
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,519
so if they cannot trace the provenance

313
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,600
back to the original breeder there's a

314
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
problem and you probably

315
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
i mean you can always take the risk and

316
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,480
try but here's the thing if you're

317
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
taking a risk and trying but you've

318
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,240
never had the original clone how are you

319
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,838
ever going to [ __ ] verify it and and

320
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,879
people with the chem 91 cut wouldn't be

321
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,880
selling it

322
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,078
not like that that's not how that works

323
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,919
so

324
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,679
yeah archive portland's a great place to

325
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,278
get clones archives as big a nerd as

326
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,519
anyone when it comes to provenance he

327
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,039
doesn't [ __ ] around so if you're getting

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,320
stuff from archive portland that's a

329
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,919
great source

330
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,519
um

331
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,838
but yeah i mean most of these kids are

332
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,078
just trading

333
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,680
clones just trading with people who have

334
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,359
no access to anything and shouldn't have

335
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,199
access to anything and then some of

336
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,720
these dudes are cool and like they don't

337
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,519
understand this has gone on and they

338
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,959
repeat it and they repeat the story and

339
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,720
now someone else has that story and they

340
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,919
say but this guy is trustworthy yeah who

341
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,680
was the guy that you got it from was

342
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,479
that dude trustworthy probably not you

343
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,000
know

344
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
um

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,320
that is that is

346
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,360
the best advice i could ever give you

347
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,959
chase that [ __ ] up the chain do not see

348
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
places like harbor side they have people

349
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,239
that they randomly get so

350
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
back in the day at least i don't know i

351
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
don't want to speak to now but back in

352
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,480
the day they would have random people

353
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,759
bring in clays or trays of clones or

354
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,039
they'd have their in-house cloner but

355
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,120
often they'd have people bringing trays

356
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,759
of clones you're trusting some random

357
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,399
ass that a bud tender trusted to bring

358
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,200
in clones and vet them

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
why why have you guys ever talked to bud

360
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,879
tenders

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
you know they know less than probably

362
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,799
you do even if you're a new person but

363
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,199
tenders don't get into provenance

364
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,679
sourcing any of that stuff if you want

365
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:45,039
to source something do it right

366
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,198
take the time meet people be friendly be

367
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,278
trustworthy don't be a snake and you'd

368
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,759
be surprised how quickly things open up

369
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,679
i've told that to people from day one

370
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,838
and everybody wants to work it around

371
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,439
the around the back end

372
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
i i can't comment on finest because i

373
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,480
don't i

374
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,240
i don't know who they source stuff from

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,159
etc but they've been very nice and

376
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,959
they've done great um tissue culture

377
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,319
work

378
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,599
but as far as

379
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,278
like

380
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
yeah i know yeah

381
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,679
let's see

382
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,759
pre 90 379 500 a pop that blah blah

383
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,399
that pre-79 bubba

384
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,399
but yeah i mean

385
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,920
if you don't care

386
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,919
then you're adding to the problem

387
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,399
frankly that's that's really what it

388
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
what it comes down to if you don't care

389
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,679
and you're

390
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,040
passing these stories on without doing

391
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,399
the work then you're adding to the

392
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,879
problem

393
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,919
and that that's where i have a problem

394
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,360
and that's why you see all this

395
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,278
confusion in the market people throwing

396
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,759
up pictures of a chem 91 that don't look

397
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,078
like chem 91 you know maybe it's just a

398
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,958
really weird grow maybe they over blew

399
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,000
it but i see people commenting

400
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,399
in these in these [ __ ] threads let me

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,958
see for example let me see if i can find

402
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,958
it real quick

403
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,559
let me see

404
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,958
a good example

405
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,638
of someone oh you can't really see it

406
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,479
commenting in a thread that has no

407
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,039
[ __ ] clue what they're talking about

408
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
this two currents guy he's new

409
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,439
he's probably newer than most of you

410
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,278
but he's telling acting like he has a

411
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,519
way that he can oh that might be a

412
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,439
[ __ ] hybrid i don't know

413
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,278
[ __ ] where did you source your

414
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
chem 91 to be making these judgments and

415
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,919
claims oh oh you didn't oh you didn't oh

416
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,198
did you say you sourced it from one of

417
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,399
my best friends

418
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,159
you're lying so it it's how it goes how

419
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,240
it goes you know but then other people

420
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,519
don't know they see this dude speaking

421
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,879
in there they don't know that he's a

422
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,639
noob they don't know any of that [ __ ]

423
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,838
and they're like oh well if he says it

424
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,360
might be real then it might yeah

425
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,600
that's how it goes

426
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,399
this is how the [ __ ] just spins on and

427
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
on and on and on how people set them up

428
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,278
up sell themselves up to be

429
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
a verifier of cuts when they have no

430
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,320
place verifying anything

431
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
um

432
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
and you like i said you'll be

433
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,519
hard-pressed to find someone that will

434
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,439
verify or shoot something down um i

435
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,519
could give you actually with chem 91 i

436
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,360
could give you a few pointers and i know

437
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,120
i've mentioned a few before

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
but um a few pointers leaf

439
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
cannibalization

440
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,239
that's nutrient burn that's not the

441
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,519
leafs cannibalizing themselves the one

442
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,799
trait it does seem to have is the never

443
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,639
ending white pistols but it looks like

444
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,078
someone just newt burned the [ __ ] out of

445
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,879
uh s1 or hybrid of chem 91

446
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,198
but in certain micro climates maybe

447
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,078
maybe it's hard to say

448
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,719
but i would feel much more confident

449
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,239
not even commenting on this thing

450
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
because there's no way there's no way to

451
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,919
know for sure unless it's got a lot of

452
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,319
the traits and it's missing one so what

453
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,000
can you do

454
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,480
anyway yeah i just wanted to give a

455
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,039
quick example um you know someone was

456
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,800
claiming to have a cut of archives

457
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,958
moonbow

458
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,559
oh cancel i didn't want to do that

459
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,638
someone's claiming to have a cut of

460
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,078
archives moonbow

461
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,320
well archive called them out on it and

462
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,639
then the guy's like oh no no no no no i

463
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,160
mean i had the breeder cut of uh

464
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
something else rainbow belts or

465
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,360
something it's another one that archives

466
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,240
not gonna pass cuts out his breeder cuts

467
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,519
out of

468
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,599
so be careful be careful who you trust

469
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,359
run these [ __ ] down

470
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,000
see what they know about

471
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,000
about sourcing cuts see who they're

472
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,279
dialed into circle wise

473
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,880
ask them

474
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,399
then go ask some dudes in the circle

475
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,600
likely people will be honest with you

476
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
and tell you if they're in their circle

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,439
or not it's very easy to do

478
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:36,079
very [ __ ] easy to do

479
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
anyway

480
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
that's that's about what i wanted to run

481
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,599
down on that i think i think that it

482
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
used to be more common knowledge how you

483
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,719
did it

484
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
you make friends

485
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,319
you get into circles

486
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,559
you don't get [ __ ] immediately because

487
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,240
everybody's been ripped off to [ __ ] you

488
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,480
know some people get mad that they can't

489
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
just get that clone immediately because

490
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,480
clone hoarders it's not fair you know

491
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
why it's not fair it's because [ __ ]

492
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,640
scammers rip everyone off

493
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,558
and it's been been that way since day

494
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,120
one been that way since day one so

495
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,359
people people that do have cuts are not

496
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,439
like super open to just some random new

497
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,439
guy who says hey i'm cool give it to me

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,880
i promise like that's been done for

499
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,240
years and years and years and years and

500
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
been heard for years and years and years

501
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
and it's a major trigger for a lot of

502
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,000
people um

503
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,000
people in these circles love to share

504
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
their clones

505
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
do i look way more serious

506
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
people in those in those circles love to

507
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
share their clones because they love

508
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,279
sharing dank with people

509
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
they don't necessarily like to openly

510
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,038
share clones with random people to

511
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,320
bastardize the clone

512
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,919
um

513
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,240
another good example of this had been

514
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
when everyone was trying to chase joint

515
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,160
breath for chems

516
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,679
you know i could i could go way further

517
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,038
into that but i'm not going to for the

518
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,960
sake of my buddy mad elite um not gonna

519
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:57,119
i'm not gonna talk about old p blood but

520
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,360
needless to say blind leading the blind

521
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,199
in that situation and people were still

522
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,519
paying joint breath for clones because

523
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,720
they really had that hope it's that fear

524
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,200
of missing out

525
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,519
uh logical fallacy and it's also the

526
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
appeal to authority logical fallacy both

527
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,599
of those are there the authority being

528
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,879
oh well this guy's a breeder he says

529
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,759
he's a breeder

530
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
and

531
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,640
and peat bud says he's legit

532
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,320
well that must mean these are legit

533
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,840
well how much do you know about how much

534
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,200
experience peabody's had with the actual

535
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,720
clones

536
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,319
uh

537
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,038
have you ever heard the story about him

538
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,798
bringing kim for as chem d to a cup and

539
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,798
entering it exactly

540
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,839
so

541
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,119
yeah

542
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,678
i shouldn't have probably gone that far

543
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,678
in but there's a point to it you can't

544
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,038
just trust everyone just because

545
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
someone's name is even linked with the

546
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,079
clone it's not necessarily a good reason

547
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
to

548
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,079
uh necessarily take their word on on

549
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
clone provenance

550
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,119
so yeah

551
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,120
anybody got any questions about that

552
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,400
the dog bud male exactly and pete budd

553
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,000
put his name behind a dog bud mill does

554
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
that make any sense [ __ ] no and

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
everybody else around him was telling

556
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,240
don't do that

557
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,559
that dude's a liar that's gonna be a

558
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,440
problem and come back to haunt you but

559
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,240
sometimes money is just too much of a

560
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,279
uh uh yank i mean i really really liked

561
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
bee bud i did but i mean you know he was

562
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,319
backing someone who said they were going

563
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
to murder me and someone who would say

564
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,678
the n-word over and over and over you

565
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
know i can't deal with that i can't

566
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,798
handle that

567
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
hopefully he's he's figured life out a

568
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,279
little better and who to run with and

569
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,280
who not to run with

570
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,558
oh i gotta go be going to church

571
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,200
just because i'm wearing a

572
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,200
long sleeve

573
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,839
mass g said he got a male knows that and

574
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,960
he's also said he didn't so you know

575
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,959
that comes back to it

576
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,038
i have a question where is the start of

577
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
the line to get my money back

578
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,879
you know

579
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,280
problem is many don't care

580
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,600
about history or the provenance that

581
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,359
make loot exactly and and a lot of

582
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,038
people in here are in here because they

583
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,558
do care about that and that's a point we

584
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,599
want to get everybody educated on the

585
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,839
same page

586
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,639
that oh no this is a

587
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:26,240
key lime lacroix yeah these are the bomb

588
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,240
that's pretty much what i always drink

589
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,678
i haven't tried a fire sample of apple

590
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,720
fritter yeah i'm not a apple fritter guy

591
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,600
i've never

592
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
really

593
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,839
run that stuff so i can't comment on

594
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,840
apple fritter lumpy's given me some good

595
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,879
cuts though before and they were legit

596
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,480
so

597
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,159
there is that

598
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,599
lumpy was a good source for the the

599
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,600
cookies and cherry pie or leon

600
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,839
i brought as usual i brought out another

601
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
guitar by the way to show you guys just

602
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,599
because i can

603
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,200
i brought out the black beauty today

604
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,279
now this is just an epiphone black

605
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,000
beauty but

606
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,440
you know it's still very beautiful

607
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,599
all gold hardware i'm actually going to

608
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,159
change out these um

609
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,119
these pickups i have some um

610
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
toaster

611
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,359
uh hand wound pickups that are going in

612
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,199
it look a little more gretchy

613
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,079
sound a little more gretchy

614
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
um

615
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,759
yeah this is one of the babies though

616
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,279
all bound it's the old epiphone

617
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,240
headstock which i wish it would have

618
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,720
been one of the new ones that looked

619
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
more gibsony but it is so pretty

620
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,798
isn't it

621
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,798
yes beautiful

622
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
i don't remember why i got it if i was

623
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,038
thinking i was going to play some mike

624
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
ness style stuff or what but

625
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,038
yeah i'm not usually i'm the less

626
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,440
pickups are better but this case i went

627
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,919
for all three

628
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,558
shit's pretty

629
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,559
in this case

630
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,559
anyway yeah

631
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,679
leave it up if you can um this is going

632
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,678
to be posted on patreon after this so if

633
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,360
you guys want to rewatch run it through

634
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,519
the patreon stuff

635
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,558
yeah this isn't a gibson case too i

636
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,960
don't remember where i got the gibson

637
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,960
case at for that one

638
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,558
are you a neck or bridge pickup kind of

639
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,440
guy uh

640
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:19,240
neck mostly neck i like the neck sounds

641
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,240
for punk rock and garage

642
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,880
years from now i bet you're glad the

643
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,159
headstock is og yeah probably huh i just

644
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,360
think it's so much prettier the other

645
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,360
headstocks are so much prettier

646
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,759
but yeah i mean

647
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,000
i wanted a gibson one

648
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,440
but in the end after owning a bunch of

649
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,200
gibsons and a bunch of um epiphones

650
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,080
i've determined i like the next better

651
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,038
on

652
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,439
on um epiphone les pauls i don't know

653
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,599
why like they have something closer to a

654
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,480
gibson sg type neck

655
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,879
from my experience and i like that nice

656
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,919
thin neck because i've got

657
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,600
little lady hands you know

658
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,600
the the i'm not familiar with the the

659
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,278
what is the story around the two tim

660
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,360
there's way more way more way more cuts

661
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:16,159
of chem d than just two going around

662
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,519
yeah there's way more there's the sham d

663
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,440
the chem d

664
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,319
the dirty d

665
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,919
dead ringer the bundy sis and some of

666
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,200

seriously i love bodhi um

723
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,319
radio ridge has been doing an amazing

724
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,640
job of sourcing legit genetics for a

725
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,240
long time and even before they even talk

726
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,840
about them they run them through a lot

727
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,759
of people to make sure that they have a

728
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,519
legit cut before they declare having any

729
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,278
kind of cut which

730
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,000
uh

731
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,599
yeah no it's the same guy black metal

732
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,640
you're definitely talking about the same

733
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,918
idiot

734
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,919
um

735
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,000
another dude let me give you another

736
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,520
example today and this is one that i

737
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,119
probably should have [ __ ] slapped

738
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,679
down much harder earlier on where is it

739
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,599
where's the fake bull rider well maybe i

740
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,000
don't have a picture of it ready

741
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,839
um

742
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,798
this one dude was showing fake pictures

743
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,319
of bull rider is this it

744
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:09,359
that

745
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:11,200
this dude is dude nobody no no san diego

746
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,639
old-schoolers respect this dude have

747
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,798
ever heard of this dude before that um

748
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,000
he's a complete [ __ ] he had made

749
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,759
claims that he and his partner made

750
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,798
afghani bull rider and he didn't know

751
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,398
that there was a difference between

752
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,879
afghani bull rider and original bull

753
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,158
rider so now since he's been made aware

754
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,960
of that he's now claiming he has

755
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,278
original bull rider which is dead

756
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,278
um

757
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,719
yeah there is that there is that little

758
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,000
situation that is not alive anymore

759
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,319
never mind that though that's just

760
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,200
details details details

761
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,278
um

762
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
yeah that if anybody wants a real bull

763
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,038
rider cut the closest you're gonna get

764
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
is old betsy and old betsy hybrids right

765
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,480
now um

766
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,319
and there's plenty of those available so

767
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,919
there's no reason to

768
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,398
uh even

769
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,360
even [ __ ] with someone that stupid heard

770
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,719
of pnw strain hunter i have not

771
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,278
i have not

772
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,480
where did skunk one originate from

773
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,720
uh

774
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,558
that's probably the most

775
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,278
known story in the history of cannabis

776
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,599
and most documented uh sam the skunk man

777
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,359
what is a true dg two blueberry people

778
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,398
say dj shorts i went through 23

779
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,959
blueberry cuts to find the one that

780
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,639
smells like sour milk and muffins

781
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,200
um dj

782
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,278
was the one who popularized the

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,720
line called blueberry but there have

784
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,919
been other cuts called blueberry that

785
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,120
didn't come from his stuff from around

786
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,120
the same time

787
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,639
so hopefully that helps

788
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,439
um

789
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
what else we got

790
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,038
[ __ ] writer is correct

791
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,798
yeah the rx farmer that was the afghani

792
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,759
bull rider i was referring to not the

793
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:51,200
old bull rider that i had in my backpack

794
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,200
back then it was called bulgani

795
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,600
yeah black metal i'm guarantee it's the

796
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,640
same dude same dude we've all been

797
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,079
talking about there's people in here

798
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,399
who've been ripped off by that dude that

799
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,639
can tell you just as much it's not on my

800
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:02,639
word

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,520
anyway

802
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,798
what are some old clones that are still

803
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,200
around that you would like to get your

804
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,200
hands on

805
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,519
old clones that are still around i'd

806
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,440
like to get my hands on purple indica

807
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,879
but it's not even you know what like

808
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,399
even stuff like that

809
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,399
via via

810
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:32,719
archive to csi csi super

811
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,918
honest with clones and sharing and it

812
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,000
was asked not to share so i've still

813
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,480
never grown purple indica pure

814
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
so like a clone like that i'd be very

815
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,000
interested in um

816
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,919
trying to think of some other one oh the

817
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,319
corn the corn is another one i'd be

818
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
really interested in

819
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,439
um

820
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,960
let's see what is the relation of old

821
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,960
betsy and bull rider sister stock

822
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,119
the the the cuts came from the same

823
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,960
person so yeah

824
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,798
and guys like brandon rust wouldn't know

825
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
that [ __ ] so

826
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,879
but i bet after this he'll be repeating

827
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,720
it like it's [ __ ] some [ __ ] he always

828
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,240
knew

829
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,000
see that's a problem there's there are

830
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,960
double-edged swords to

831
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,240
uh

832
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,319
putting info out there like this

833
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,480
yeah i i ran some metal haze back in the

834
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,158
day from um dutch flowers we did some

835

836
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,360
interesting uh line pretty sure it's um

837
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,038
positronics haze 19 crossed a skunk one

838
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,278
that

839
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:37,839
uh positronic sold for a long time and

840
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:37,839
was renamed

841
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,319
baby yoda i've never even heard of baby

842

yoda to be selling it for a thousand

843
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,879
i mean

844
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,798
you know

845
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,640
again

846
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,079
it's possible to buy clones that are

847
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
legit

848
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,319
but know your sourcing always ask

849
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,798
questions don't just assume

850
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:01,119
like and i get it's very like you want

851
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,720
to be that one dude who can

852
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,199
source something

853
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
and and be like oh i'm the

854
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,960
be like i'm the one who got it yes i'm

855
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,960
one of the very few rare

856
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
people that have this rare cut but

857
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,038
nine times out of ten that's not gonna

858
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,519
happen it just isn't

859
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,038
so tom hill hayes skunk one no

860
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,919
tom hill's haze was a selection from

861
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,440
positronics haze 19 but it

862
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,399
probably was nothing like the same pheno

863
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
because there were so many different

864
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,278
phenoes

865
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
so but similar yes

866
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,319
uh have you run much of the legends or

867
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,080

871
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,599

but yeah those are the the top ones from

878
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:56,720
both of them that i really really dug

879
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,079
how about that archive post dude selling

880
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,919
one yeah we talked about that a little

881
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:05,439
bit ago yeah it's it is what it is

882
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,679
that's what what kind of is is helping

883
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,880
foster these situations is is people

884
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,880
like that you know

885
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,480
but did el jefe verified cuts of his

886
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,480
elites so jefe what jfe did was he made

887
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,759
it into our circle and i remember i was

888
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,519
talking about

889
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,720
uh people that get into circles and rip

890
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,399
people off and get booted out that's

891
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,839
exactly what he did

892
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,759
everybody in the circle was very open

893
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,278
with each other and with clones

894
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,679
and

895
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,359
jefe got a lot of clones from everyone

896
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,798
in the group and ripped everyone off and

897
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,240
immediately started selling them against

898
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,839
everybody's wishes

899
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,599
um

900
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,199
he's one of the reasons

901
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,480
a perfect example of someone who's a

902
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,480
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] that does that

903
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,000
luckily he lost most of them

904
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,159
and um

905
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,880
and some of them he was handed were fake

906
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,760
so we can be thankful for that

907
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,519
but um yeah

908
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,119
it's a shame it's a shame

909
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,720
what's the one cut that you haven't

910
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,719
worked with that you would grab if you

911
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
could

912
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,120
i'll go with corn on that one just cause

913
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
yeah

914
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,558
if it was hilarious until he wasn't i

915
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,000
agree

916
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,960
um

917
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,519
he he damaged and burned every bridge he

918
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,278
possibly could have [ __ ] had

919
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,399
which made a lot of sense because he

920
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,240
when he came to our crew he didn't

921
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,199
really have any friends

922
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,000
corn is an old cut for uh that archive

923
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,360
has

924
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,798
you'd have to ask him what what it

925
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,158
actually is and the story behind it i

926
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,599
don't remember

927
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,880
what was purple paint there were a few

928
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,959
different purple paints but purple

929
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,720
champagne was supposed to be the the

930
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,840
derb the f1 dirt it's been called a

931
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,839
thousand different things so

932
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,200
stay trippy uh who is who is he

933
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,399
with the fake death star

934
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,319
i don't know

935
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,038
how big a fairy phenom variation would

936
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,319
you see in chem 91 s ones i haven't run

937
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,640
them but um just from observing people

938
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,398
pop them online and and talking to csi

939
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,000
it sounds like it has a a fairly good

940
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,518
amount of variation stuff that looks

941
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,398
like sour all the way to stuff looks

942
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,399
like pure afghani

943
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,320
i don't know what copy genetics is

944
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,000
double purple doja um

945
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,838
i don't

946
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,280
that was that's always been pretty rare

947
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,838
so if people pop up at the day i'm

948
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,359
always skeptical but

949
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,519
fairfax election according to the icy

950
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,918
mag forums but there's more than one

951
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,800
corn on there fairfax selection i'm not

952
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,519
sure it might be four-way selection

953
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,159
it could be could be did jeff take make

954
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,800
afghani bull rider i don't know i mean i

955
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,800
i i smoked it sold it after any bull

956
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,879
rider bud but i never really cared

957
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
because it like who did what because it

958
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,838
wasn't bull rider

959
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,039
didn't have anything to do with it i

960
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,440
don't think

961
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:49,918
how's the nl preservation project going

962
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,838

963
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,358

964
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,878
death star

965
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,559
so i wouldn't know

966
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,118

that [ __ ] from woodshed was ridiculous

969
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,199
he brought that to a party uh i was the

970
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,838
first canned illuminati party and he was

971
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,199
just invited in to to come to the party

972
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,199
and he showed up with his death star

973
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,960
he'd been [ __ ] banging on about how

974

dank it was and i took one look and one

975
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,880
smells like

976
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,000
[ __ ] you got skunk one you got

977
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,559
skunk one bro and if you can't tell that

978
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,159
you shouldn't be trading cuts but yeah i

979
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,159
don't know this is [ __ ] funny

980
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:33,039
yeah that [ __ ] was garb though i mean it

981
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,119

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,559
i'm looking forward to that project too

987
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,320
across the nl5 to one of those p91s

988
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,519
not a bad idea i think that could be

989
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,519
very nice like a

990
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,559
older afghani base

991
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,000
yeah that'd be really cool

992
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,599
i've already talked about that like i

993
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,920
said i'm not going to keep bringing up

994
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,119
or spending time on a [ __ ] nobody but

995
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,280

998
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,960

999
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,000
um

1000
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,199
yeah so that's that's a rough treatise

1001
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,760
on

1002
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,439
how you should verify cuts how you go

1003
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,839
get these cuts um

1004
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,920
yeah it's really there's not a great

1005
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,400
shortcut i'm sorry

1006
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,240
it's not a great shortcut

1007
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,480
sometimes it takes years to get a cut

1008
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,838
and sometimes you'll never get it

1009
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,838
just is what it is you can't

1010
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,838
people calling things elites

1011
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,358
has

1012
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,000
caused

1013
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,000
a lot of

1014
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,159
different ideas about what these cuts

1015
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,400
are and how good they are everything is

1016
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,920
subjective so

1017
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,920
what i consider elite may not be what

1018
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,280
you consider elite but back in the day

1019
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,800
it was a consensus value given to stuff

1020
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
if something kept getting passed because

1021
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,720
there wasn't the online hype system and

1022
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,400
instagram for pictures and what's

1023
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,679
whatnot if things kept getting passed it

1024
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,880
was because they were naturally hyping

1025
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,480
themselves because they were dank and

1026
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,920
after a certain point enough people

1027
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,480
agreed that this clone is dank that's

1028
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,320
how you got an elite cut nowadays it's

1029
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
anything that gets thrown on instagram

1030
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,760
that some hype schmuck wants you to

1031
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,679
think you know is legit

1032
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,680
okay what do you think the relationship

1033
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,879
between super skunk and chem is if any i

1034
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:37,440
think chem 91 is a pure super skunk

1035
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,000
um that's just my best guess but pretty

1036
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,679
pretty sure on that one

1037
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,199
first class genetics is the number one

1038
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,358
in legit cuts i'm glad you know that

1039
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,960
because i i don't i don't i don't know

1040
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,838
that i'm sure the guy's nice but i i

1041
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,599
just he's not in our circle so i don't

1042
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,599
know um anything about what he has

1043
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,920
[Music]

1044
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
what's up fatty

1045
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,159
gainesville green's still going around

1046
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,240
i've never seen a real cut of

1047
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,159
gainesville green in my life

1048
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,078
i've seen a lot of fake cuts of it

1049
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,679
anything about fire alien ramen that was

1050
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
og rascal and it was a seed line

1051
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,400
oh you have cuban black haze cool that's

1052
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,000
what i was talking about like that

1053
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,599
incognito guy that's one of the ones he

1054
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,079
brought to the table along with ken

1055
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:26,800
three and fake mass super skunk so

1056
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,800
yeah y'all getting y'all getting skunked

1057
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,159
y'all getting skunked

1058
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,920
um we got some stuff first class i can

1059
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,480
figure in definitely not unhappy that's

1060
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,280
good see that's a that's a good good

1061
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,639
call

1062
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
as long as this stuff you know what it

1063
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,759
is in the first place before you get it

1064
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,919
otherwise i mean

1065
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
things can be

1066
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,519
this is where some confusion also comes

1067
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,199
in because things can be dank

1068
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,679
right you can get a fake clone that's

1069
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,598
super dank probably even better

1070
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:56,719
than the than the clone only however

1071
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,640
does that make it legit

1072
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,838
you know you have to know the

1073
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,279
you have to be able to identify

1074
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,639
something in the first place before you

1075
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,839
can uh

1076
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,440
verify it

1077
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,759
yeah you just gotta know you have to

1078
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,599
know it in advance what's the difference

1079
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,839
in amherst sour

1080
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,480
aj salary csd

1081
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,799
i am her sour

1082
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,079
new to me i mean like i get like people

1083
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,000
were saying it was from amherst so

1084
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,440
someone smacked amherst on the front of

1085
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,440
a sauerkraut i don't know anything about

1086
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,000
that sour cut i only know easy sd the

1087
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,519
choco same thing

1088
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,679
the aj sour was very dank but what aj uh

1089
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:36,880
considers his sour

1090
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,879
now was nothing like the old aj sour cut

1091
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,800
so yeah

1092
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,800
salt and lime never heard of that no

1093
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,199
see like the cuban black case a lot of

1094
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,358
people like it

1095
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,480
but is that what it is

1096
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,319
i don't know

1097
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,519
i don't know i know where it came from

1098
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,039
and i know that it

1099
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,119
i know the provenance on it and that

1100
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,880
that guy passed two other fake cuts when

1101
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,318
he passed that cut

1102
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,760
so yeah

1103
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,838
yeah the archived cut of sour would be

1104
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,640
the same thing as the choco the ecst et

1105
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:14,400
cetera

1106
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,400
so those are the same exact cuts

1107
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,159
if you're comparing archives versus

1108
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,598
choco they're the same cuts

1109
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,358
who was the original train wreck so the

1110
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,440
original train wreck

1111
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,400
supposedly was nothing like the train

1112
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,119
wreck that got pushed by ae

1113
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,960
32 in the arcade train wreck it was much

1114
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,640
different before that but the one that

1115
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,240
gets passed the most is like that lemony

1116
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,159
torpedoing one

1117
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,199
and that's what most people

1118
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,118
yeah

1119
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,000
and mandel crotch put the amherst on the

1120
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,079
name again no surprise

1121
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,639
do i think the aj sour i used was the

1122
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,119
original sour no i think the choco ecst

1123
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,039
is the original sour i do

1124
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,358
but i mean

1125
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,800
who knows again that's not one we can

1126
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:55,920
take back to the total beginning because

1127
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,240
there's no

1128
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,240
true

1129
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,039
there's no true like agreement between

1130
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,598
the original guys that had this hour

1131
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,199
on what that sour is now

1132
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,640
i don't think any of them could identify

1133
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,318
it today by any stretch of the

1134
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,679
imagination

1135
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,279
and we tried we tried to get him to do

1136
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,279
it so

1137
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,280
yeah

1138
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,079
an incredible train wreck fino in bubble

1139
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,240
gum breath crosses

1140
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,000
that me

1141
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,759
why is there a train wreck

1142
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,800
phenos and bubble gum breath crosses

1143
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,400
that's weird

1144
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,039
i i maybe i don't know what bubbling

1145
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,280
breath is little timers in amherst that

1146
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,880
said it was the original sour originally

1147
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,040
from new york upstate it is from new

1148
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,240
york upstate but it was not called

1149
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,000
uh

1150
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,479
amherst sour no one's ever called it

1151
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,079
amherst sour back then uh

1152
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,838
as far as i know it was called our

1153
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,920
diesel and that's the original name

1154
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,318
so yeah i mean people can call whatever

1155
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,639
they want but they shouldn't if they're

1156
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:01,960
talking about original sour um it's not

1157
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,960
super debatable

1158
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,559
possibly a couple sours at first though

1159
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,440
yes

1160
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,679
yeah

1161
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,880
yeah and the other original name for it

1162
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,879
was the manny from those guys so

1163
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,880
there is also that

1164
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,240
i don't know what mendo breath is

1165
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,760
basically a mendo perps and train wreck

1166
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,838
meadow breath is not

1167
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,839
mendo perps and train wreck bro

1168
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,039
it's og kush breath

1169
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,799
and uh

1170
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,960
probably a

1171
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,318
mental purpose train wreck but og kush

1172
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,318
breath being the main part of it

1173
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,920
cam dog had fake chem 91 in high times

1174
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,800
why would you trust any what any of them

1175
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,358
say

1176
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,880
that's hard hard to argue with

1177
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,559
are there land races that get as

1178
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,559
commonly knocked off as ties

1179
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,240
i don't know on that one

1180
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,440
i mean i don't i don't know

1181
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,160
opinion what breeders are killing it

1182
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,200
right now and why um a few episodes ago

1183
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:07,118
i did a long list of breeders that are

1184
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,559
are people that i trust and that are

1185
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,039
doing some cool [ __ ]

1186
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,078
so yeah that you hit back a few episodes

1187
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,079
and you could probably find that

1188
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,639
moon tide that's a good

1189
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,440
that's

1190
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,078
another fair statement like like those

1191
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,679
those smells don't necessitate a lot

1192
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,200
more than

1193
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,039
most of the things associated with like

1194
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,039
the skunk files and stuff like that

1195
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,920
skunky dials are hermaphroditic

1196
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,480
tendencies and low potency and that's

1197
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,720
for for real

1198
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,838
but people want what they don't know and

1199
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,838
can't have

1200
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,599
so many old elites look like ugly ass

1201
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,480
plants i guess terps and highs were a

1202
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,760
bit more important for a lot of them

1203
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,719
um

1204
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
i think in modern times people equate

1205
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,439
looking good with dankness

1206
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,239
um that would be the instagram era of

1207
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,318
growers and i don't agree with that at

1208
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,479
all not even a little bit some of the

1209
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:05,759
most beautiful [ __ ] like blackberry kush

1210
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,800
is some of the

1211
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,040
worst

1212
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,519
potency

1213
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,960
on earth like you know mental purpose is

1214
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,400
[ __ ] beautiful

1215
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,559
not super potent

1216
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,160
you know but it has great terps

1217
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,199
um

1218
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,078
yeah

1219
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:24,799
there's any name any cookies hybrid i

1220
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,720
don't think it's that [ __ ] great but

1221
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,720
it's pretty so it sells yeah

1222
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,880
um i'm not sure yet pyramid i haven't

1223
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:37,279
run any yet

1224
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,119
that's right gene gino's what's up

1225
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,119
can't smoke with your [ __ ] eyes boys

1226
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,838
yeah it's uh

1227
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,960
it's like the people that run tests and

1228
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,079
think that's a great example of

1229
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,760
uh

1230
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,839
how to pick your weed and what to sell

1231
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,040
by thc volume but you know they did

1232
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,920
people haven't even looked at the

1233
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,920
entourage effect at all

1234
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,559
hog's breath is a beautiful example

1235
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,000
isn't it yeah it's not it wasn't the

1236
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,078
most gorgeous but it was one of those

1237
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,159
ones that hyped itself because it was

1238
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,200
[ __ ] dang

1239
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,199
that's absolutely true

1240
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,240
[ __ ] a gene

1241
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,639
we're gonna get gene on here eventually

1242
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:26,000
eventually he will do it he will do it

1243
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,000
and come hang out and shoot the [ __ ]

1244
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,960
do you think microbes and fungi and soil

1245
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,039
contribute to the flavor of weed i think

1246
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,039
uh the root zone is where

1247
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,880
it does all that that exchanging of

1248
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:41,039
stuff so sure i think sulfur um

1249
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,200
added sulfur helps with with terps and

1250
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,639
stuff like that um

1251
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,919
yeah favorite chem to smoke i liked chem

1252
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,799
one because it was so different than the

1253
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,400
other chems and i like uh diesel other

1254
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,480
than that if we're just saying like just

1255
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,358
cam chems

1256
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,039
well

1257
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:01,279
i guess that would depend on what chem

1258
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:04,159
is right uh chem 91 l5 haze chem 4

1259
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,160
is one of my other phase

1260
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,280
what's a strain that subverted your

1261
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,960
expectations because of how ugly it was

1262
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,839
colombian black

1263
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,400
it was beautiful to me because i knew

1264
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,279
its potential but it was just an airy

1265
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,200
mess

1266
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,119
of tiny little

1267
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,598
um

1268
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,640
tiny little

1269
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,838
bubbles of bud everywhere but it was it

1270
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,838
was amazing smoke

1271
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,400
yeah the lot has a lot of that same look

1272
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,919
that like the colombian black did just

1273
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,880
stringy

1274
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,920
you know

1275
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,519
um a lot like uh

1276
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,960
what people called grinspoon that was

1277
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,960
originally quays

1278
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,000
what happened a good widow

1279
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,519
probably the same thing that happened

1280
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,519
with everything else from the 90s people

1281
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,719
just overdid it got sick of it lots of

1282
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,400
renames

1283
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,279
um

1284
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,200
lots of bad impressions of weed that was

1285
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,400
not widow

1286
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,759
stuff like that

1287
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,760
how do you feel now that tissue culture

1288
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,599
has really started to gain momentum and

1289
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,599
become more available with honest people

1290
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,318
ask fatty i haven't ever since i got

1291
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,079
screwed by by mooney moon dog on on

1292
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:15,838
tissue culturing i've stayed so far away

1293
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,839
from it and don't care

1294
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,838
because it's just a bad experience but i

1295
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,639
know my boy fatty's been doing some some

1296
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,639
cool [ __ ] with it

1297
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,279
uh dog walker og is kind of ugly but

1298
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,640
smokes fantastic i i think he's kind of

1299
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,640
pretty it smokes great though

1300
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,640
he got he did not get the cut from grace

1301
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,318
goal

1302
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,000
brandon did not get the cut from

1303
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:39,599
grayskull because grayscale doesn't have

1304
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,280
the [ __ ] cut grayscale will tell you

1305
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,119
doesn't have the cut i had the last of

1306
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,880
grayscale's bull rider seeds and they

1307
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,358
weren't gonna pop so they had to take

1308
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,559
him to a uh tissue culture guy not sure

1309
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,960
what's up with that since then but

1310
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:54,160
brandon did not get [ __ ] from

1311
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,199
[ __ ] grace goal grace wouldn't

1312
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:59,920
never [ __ ] with that kid god what a

1313
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,239
say but i mean and again brandon rust is

1314
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,760
a noob but people just think for some

1315
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,759
reason because he says he's not that he

1316
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,760
isn't

1317
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,039
people are liars you gotta ask the

1318
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,639
people themselves

1319
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,920
why don't you ever smoke weed during la

1320
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,159
is one i don't want to get them shut

1321
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,920
down too i can't answer fast if i'm

1322
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,960
stoned

1323
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,400
just can't i've tried a few live and uh

1324
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,079
stoned and that just doesn't work out

1325
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,039
well

1326
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,400

00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:42,559
a bag seed and that was that

1334

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,559
they're legit and old school and they

1338
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,479

1339
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,839

how is the csi nl project going it's

1354
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,720
going great going great they overgrew

1355
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,239
everything really fast it's obviously

1356
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,879
some kind of afghani hybrid which is

1357
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,679
what we want from a nl5

1358
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,358
um

1359
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,639
that

1360
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,558
gives more truth to what it's supposed

1361
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,920
to be because we are always going to

1362
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,640
keep making sure

1363
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,559
that it is what we think it is

1364
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,118
do you know what steve murphy afghani is

1365
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,720
yeah afghani or actually that as it was

1366
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,160
told to me it could be a pakistani or

1367
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,759
afghani they weren't sure it was a girl

1368
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,838
who went over and brought them back to

1369
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,520
steve murphy so it could be pakistani or

1370
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:08,558
afghani but she was so it was picked up

1371
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,400
somewhere along that line

1372
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,480
weasel with the diesel say sour d came

1373

1376
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,799

respect to him nice dude but i

1378
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,599
i've heard too many different stories

1379
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,960
coming out dude's mouth to be very

1380
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,480
reliable but we do know vondo and vondo

1381
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,920
has been the most reliable and

1382
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,280
consistent when it comes to stories

1383
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,039
about the sour

1384
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,000
and um

1385
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,079
and

1386
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,079
yeah weasel with the diesel knows vondo

1387
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,800
too and they were roommates but he's

1388
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:43,119
been the most consistent and out of the

1389
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,160
spotlight wants nothing to do with any

1390
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,640
fame

1391
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:50,799
glory from northern or from sour so yeah

1392
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,759
how is golden coast vintage afghani it

1393
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,039
was a

1394
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,559
short squat

1395
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,838
little creamy

1396
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,839
hashy afghani

1397
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,760
nothing great

1398
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,040
but uh it was pretty

1399
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,520
anything about cause i don't even know

1400
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,519
who cosmic wisdom is sorry

1401
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,519
um

1402
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,639
uh would we get a shawnee kid he just

1403
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,800
did an episode with me

1404
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,719
how would you describe the nose on

1405
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,200
instructure on pakistani to troll kush

1406
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,239
depending on

1407
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,480
uh

1408
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,558
depending on the phenotype you can get

1409
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,240
like blackberry the green phenos showed

1410
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,480
a lot of lemon and there's a lot of

1411
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,838
terpenoline mixed in but there's other

1412
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,880
notes too

1413
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:36,719
um

1414
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,160
yeah caleb would be the person i mean

1415
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,558
csi would be the person to talk about

1416
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,279
that anywhere vondo's story can be found

1417
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,839
we brought vondo into our circle and

1418
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,280
interviewed him extensively and i just

1419
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:48,480
told it to you so

1420
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,079
that's about the best place you're gonna

1421
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,240
get unless you're friends with them so

1422
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,160
do you believe that sour cake from head

1423
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,558
sour came from headband

1424
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,239
those guys can't even agree on who

1425
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,800
named headband

1426
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,879
let alone um

1427
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,400
any of it i've watched

1428
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,519
several people from that group including

1429
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,880
ajj and and maybe one of them did name

1430
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,199
it but

1431
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,358
jj says he's named it aj said he's named

1432
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:16,799
it and i believe klopp said he's named

1433
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:19,598
it uh weasel so

1434
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,200
who knows who knows maybe one of them

1435
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,519
did maybe one of them didn't

1436
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,358
but sour was before that so it would

1437
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,440
make it very hard for sauer to come from

1438
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,440
headband how do you pick a name for a

1439
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,920
strain

1440
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,240
don't ask me i come up with dumb ass

1441
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,240
names

1442
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,358
if you're if you have autism and you're

1443
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,079
trying to make friends and be social for

1444
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,239
cuts that's gonna be pretty hard um find

1445
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,000
a group that understands that i mean

1446
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,239
we're all

1447
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,239
i would be hard-pressed to find a group

1448
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,000
of

1449
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:53,679
seed makers that are real serious into

1450
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,599
this and real serious into collecting

1451
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,318
that aren't on the spectrum in some way

1452
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:01,200
shape or form

1453
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,039
most of my best friends have some

1454
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:06,078
level of

1455
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:09,199
autism spectrum

1456
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,280
blackberry was a backseat by soma blaze

1457
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,118
correct probably mendoperps

1458
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,240
um all of it's probably meant to perps

1459
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,559
you can find everything that they

1460
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,358
described as blackberry in mendo perps

1461
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,960
so

1462
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,639
i'm guessing it's meadowpurp's bag seed

1463
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,159
that they didn't want to

1464
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,879
admit

1465
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,879
favorite terpenoline dominant clone um i

1466
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:32,559
really like the amnesia haze

1467
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:34,240
uh um colombian black that's another one

1468
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,359
fly deport and ship yourself some yeah

1469
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:36,879
there you go

1470
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,039
that's there you go

1471
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,480

00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,400
the sunnies black russian it wasn't

1492
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:32,000
sunny's it was um

1493
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,000
the black russian was mebus

1494
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,118
so you try to like the chem one yes it's

1495
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,880
very different from um

1496
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,838
the other cans it's not super what

1497
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,519
people would associate with kemi however

1498
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,000
i think it would be great in a cross

1499
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,239
with dog [ __ ] because they are both

1500
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,519
nl5 haze dominant probably some skunk

1501
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,879
one in there too

1502
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,400
um

1503
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,400
it i think you'll get more of a

1504
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,240
traditional dutch

1505
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,599
um

1506
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:02,000
nl5 haze type by running across the two

1507
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,079
than most of what what

1508
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,760
other stuff you could buy right now

1509
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:10,400
what are you growing now uh

1510
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,440
i'll put that on a back burner for now

1511
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,639
talking about it just because i don't

1512
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,838
want people

1513
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,078

that was going on it's very hard to keep

1529
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,798
track of any of that

1530
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,199

00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,000
afghani northern lights yeah i mean when

1540
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,798
i see stuff like northern lights in a in

1541
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,798
a um

1542
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,039
in a lineage like that where there's no

1543
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,400
number to it no nothing and knowing

1544
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,440
which northern lights were over here and

1545
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,039
which ones weren't it are already i mean

1546
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,880
it could be super dank but i couldn't

1547
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,558
ever use it in anything because i just

1548
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,000
wouldn't can't chase the provenance on

1549
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,359
it and i can't say what it is unless it

1550
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,358
was super exceptional you know

1551
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,000
i'd be surprised if anyone remembered

1552
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,880
anything after fitting circle that's

1553
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,440
true

1554
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,440
that's true

1555
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,400
have you ever seen any ethiopian strains

1556
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:56,880
making its way up yeah there's people

1557
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,480
that uh people

1558
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,838
people have sold ethiopian strains

1559
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,079
before i don't know much about it in

1560
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,078

know about the one that he's using

1567
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,798
uh anything about dr atomic been trying

1568
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,558
to get him on the the show we'll see how

1569
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,679
it goes

1570
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,839
uh did you get your f1 dirt back nope

1571
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,919
not yet any idea what the harsh chemical

1572
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,599
spray paint permanent marker fumes type

1573
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,119
smells could come from

1574
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,359
different terpenes combinations of

1575
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,160
thiols terpenes

1576
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:41,279
esters etc

1577
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:44,318
who is a real humboldt seed company

1578
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:48,559
hso hsc csi well

1579
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:50,239
csi is uh humboldt original

1580
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,480
hsc was the first person to have

1581
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:55,919
humboldt seed co but i have no respect

1582
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,838
for them for many other reasons and hso

1583
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,000
split off i thought i think i may be

1584
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,599
wrong but as i've heard it's one of the

1585
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,798
people split off from humble seacoa and

1586
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,798
started humble seeds org

1587
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,318
where does the african haze come from

1588
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,759
which african haze there's like senegal

1589
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,480
haze that was a combination of two

1590
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,440
african land races with no haze in it

1591
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,079
um

1592
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,079
yeah i don't know

1593
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,679
yeah i've been trying i've been working

1594
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,640
on dr atomic but he's not he's not a big

1595
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:28,639
internet dude so it's been a little um

1596
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,078
hard but i think it would be i think

1597
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,798
he'd be a great person to interview he's

1598
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:36,359
been around a long time he's you know

1599

made some cool [ __ ]

1600
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,078
bubble man mentioned the clones game

1601
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,759
we're covered in p.m

1602
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,760
those were the days

1603
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,639
yeah i'm not sure

1604

working with

1608
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,838
any other questions

1609
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,479
about uh provenance

1610
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:07,599
clones

1611
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,599
genetics in general

1612
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,599
anything that i might know about

1613
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,480
have you tried any transki south african

1614
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,599
strains i have tried transki tried swazi

1615
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,280
early in the early on durbin um i wasn't

1616
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,519
a big fan of south africans if i'm being

1617
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,640
honest like they tended to be

1618
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,719
high

1619
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:27,920
high yielding commercial grade for

1620
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:29,118
africa

1621
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,280
which is

1622
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,280
you know

1623
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,480

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,480
dressed up for you

1625
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,318
let's see

1626
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,480
thoughts on reversal sometimes plants

1627
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,719
don't sack up they're more look like

1628
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,400
bananas normal

1629
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,919
yeah um different reversals go different

1630
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,599
ways did saint george make girl scout

1631
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,559
cookies absolutely not that's a [ __ ]

1632
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,559
story

1633
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,079
um but it is a story that keeps being

1634
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,680
spread nonetheless i've actually tried

1635
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,920
to get a hold of him to put his story on

1636
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,000
the record and they will not do it

1637
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,480
will not put it on the record but it

1638
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,599
would be easily trounced

1639
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,920
easily

1640
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,720
um i did ask the original cookies dudes

1641
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,079
to

1642
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,358
uh

1643
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,400
talk about it and we'll see hopefully

1644
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:16,639
they will hopefully they'll be

1645
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,960
interested in it what terpene or combo

1646
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:22,400
of terpenes make blueberry smell

1647
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,400
mercene and then different

1648
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:28,880
ever run out any of skunk man's gear

1649

1653
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,598
there were a bunch of freebies that were

1654
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:39,679
given out by sam the skunk man back in

1655
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,359
the day i did run some of the uh the

1656
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,798
stuff that they sold through dna is the

1657
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:44,798
skunk train that salmon made too

1658
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:50,479
who was on shingolos

1659
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,079
talking about it st george or maybe he

1660
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,719
was just [ __ ] being a dick to me

1661
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,000
either way he's not the dude um

1662
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,598
that's that's it's pretty well

1663
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,440
documented uh where cookies came from

1664
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,440
pretty well documented does the trinity

1665
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,440
cut you are all using a berry terps no

1666
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,318
um

1667
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:15,280
i think that the people who made cookies

1668
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:17,519
know what it is but don't really um

1669
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,240
don't really want to put the full recipe

1670
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:22,079
out there i it's very easy to remake

1671
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:23,439
cookies

1672
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,640
so

1673
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,960
um

1674
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,118
yeah i've heard what st george says it

1675
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,240
is

1676
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,680
but

1677
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,279
yeah

1678
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:34,879
i don't know it's one of those things

1679
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,559
where

1680
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,720
uh so many people want to take credit

1681
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,880
for it that there's so much [ __ ] out

1682
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:43,358

1683

1686
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,400
and

1687

uh got booted from our scene

1688
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:57,119
of friends because he just chose to work

1689
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,119
with snitches and that's what happens

1690
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,599
cherry pie pack is danny to trolley no

1691

constant terpenoline digging all that up

1693
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,880

1694
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,280
in

1695
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,960
that combination so yeah

1696
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,839
no plants tell the truth people tell

1697
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,240
stories

1698
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:19,599
i always go back to that

1699
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:21,439
cookies was life

1700
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:24,000
oh lord

1701
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,920
any backstory in starfighter no

1702
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,519
that was already when i stopped when

1703
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,440
that pop came out i had already stopped

1704
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:33,000
paying attention to everything like the

1705
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,000
new people were doing

1706
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,000
any work with you and smell boat on the

1707
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
back burner no i smell boat's been doing

1708
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,679
his own thing he's you know he's got

1709
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,400
he's a daddy he's got life so he hasn't

1710
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,399
really been um

1711
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,920
he hasn't really been doing much but

1712
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,919
yeah he's a good dude

1713
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,519
one of the friends i hope it'd be nice

1714
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,358
to see him get back to it also because

1715
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,639
he grew really dank we need always bring

1716
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:58,318
it to me

1717
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,239
you think cookies is og i think there's

1718
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:01,440
a little bit more to it but i think most

1719
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:05,358
of these expressions that you see in

1720
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,358
cookies is an og oracle combination

1721
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:11,199
yeah you know um eddie leapfrog was

1722
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,798
responsible for a grain sherb

1723
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,118
that is different than the cookie fam

1724
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:15,119
shirt

1725
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,880
one is more responsible for skittles one

1726
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,159
is just not

1727
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,358
that's why there's a lot of confusion

1728
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:28,318
around that i've heard m39 yes skunk one

1729
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:30,078
uh and then another skunk one

1730
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,719
northern light five haze are just skunk

1731
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,039
one and all five i can't remember um i

1732
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:38,078
think it's gonna coin all five haze

1733
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,079
some combo thereof

1734
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:45,039
the male pakistani chatrol was an urkel

1735
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,119
morph get out of here with that [ __ ]

1736
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,400
yeah out of that yeah that's [ __ ]

1737
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,838
silly that is silly

1738
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,559
basic 5

1739
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:57,279
is the nl5 version

1740
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,720
that ssc was using in

1741
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,480
m39

1742
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,919
yeah

1743
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,000
no five

1744
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,639
skunk haze

1745
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,838
i think what's the optimal thc cbd turf

1746
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:11,279
percentage it depends on what you want

1747
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:11,279
out of it for your body chemistry

1748
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:17,199
any thoughts on dick horse genetics

1749
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,960
never heard of him never heard of her

1750
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,480
never heard of her

1751
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,280
ever asked the question over and over

1752
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,159
even though he keeps passing it

1753
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,079
uh

1754
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,838
i don't know what you're referring to

1755
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,519
i'm trying to catch everything

1756
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:30,880

1758
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,318
anything about that [ __ ]

1759
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:38,759
ever try malawi gold and all five pace i

1760
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,759

1761
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,760
what can i expect to find in your cherry

1762
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,000
gmo skittles

1763
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,559

1765
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,079
between

1766
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,119
uh that's the most honest answer i can

1767
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,680
give because there's tons of phenos it's

1768
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,960
a polyhybrid

1769
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,558
what regs you got for southern you'd

1770
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,159
recommend any of the blue bonnet stuff

1771
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,680
i'm happy with all of it it just depends

1772
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,519
on what you like out of weed

1773
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,239
that's the the most honest answer i can

1774
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:06,239
give you know

1775
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,920
best way to stabilize a home that's a

1776
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,119
winner it just depends on the actual

1777
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,720
clone

1778
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,720
um it depends on what you want to get

1779
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,558
out of it if you want an uh something

1780
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,838
that is as close to that clone as

1781
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,599
possible it's going to take lots of

1782
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:20,639
breeding

1783
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,880
what out of your current line what's

1784
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,000
your current go to when you smoke who i

1785
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,280
really like the cherry berry a lot um

1786
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,159
um

1787
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,559
the blue resin cush's [ __ ] bomb

1788
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,558
um

i'm a big fan of blue like berry ogs and

1790
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:39,679
stuff i think they combine really well

1791
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,759
especially if you get that like

1792
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:43,759
fruit loopsy pheno out of the og pushing

1793

some berry that's that's some beautiful

1794
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,799
[ __ ]

1795
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,920
how do you stabilize a herm it depends

1796
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,719
on the line

1797
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:53,680
it's not there's no just one method for

1798
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,798
stabilizing all herms terms things herm

1799
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:56,798
for different reasons and different

1800
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,559
lines and different combinations

1801
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:00,480
the blabba kush i too love blue bubba

1802

01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,720
dog

1807
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,319
nobody knows the true origin of the

1808
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,399
skittles gene would know he's up there

1809
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:15,440
with those dudes

1810
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,280
it's up for debates apparently

1811
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,200
i know some people are more confident

1812
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,039
confident about it than others can you

1813
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:22,000
talk about bubble gum and how it got to

1814
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,280

was the dude that brought it over the

1818
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:32,480
seeds you can find it on adam dunn's

1819
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,000
25th anniversary of bubblegum i think

1820
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,000
that's when they had victor and

1821
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,838
two trees on and that was the most

1822
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
legitimate as far as i know the most

1823
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,679
legitimate story that has been given

1824
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,440
about that

1825
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,038
would you say

1826
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,960
it has legit info

1827
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,559
sometimes i mean anybody could add any

1828
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,000
info i've never added a single strange

1829
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,640
seed finder and all my shit's up there

1830
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,719
and a lot of it's wrong

1831
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,960
so anybody could add info up there and

1832
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:02,480
if anybody could add info up there then

1833
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,480
there's bound to be right and wrong

1834
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,359
yeah i don't that illinois

1835
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:09,039
bubble gum story is kind of suspect i

1836
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:10,960
don't that was not a victor story that

1837
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,799
was an adam dunn story so i don't i

1838
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,280
don't buy that so is there an

1839
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,440
appalachian male appalachia was a seed

1840

1842
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,079
uh

1843
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:26,159

interesting uh it's not like necessarily

1967
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,400
a male trait but maybe it's something

1968
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:24,718
from those uh specific genetics being

1969
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:24,719

young age and not but

2086
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,199
when it comes to

2087
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,280
[ __ ] like that when you're fronting that

2096

01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,359
cannot argue with that

2099
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,599
that conclusion on old [ __ ] leap

2100
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:35,279
doctor but

2101

he's a character

2105
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:44,879
i think some people call me a character

2106
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,000

2107
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,000

strains i was 15 seeds on this

2136
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,640
phenomenon and the number 20 was just

2137
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,039
popping and you plant seeds your number

2138
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,679
seed one through 300 or 1 through 20

right 1 through 80. well we did about i

2140
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:25,600
