1
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:42,233
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:43,365
Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.

3
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,533
I'm Matthew here with my co-host Thousandfold.

4
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,633
And today we're going to unlock and unfold some of the nomenclature

5
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:52,533
with some examples and hypotheticals

6
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:56,865
on different strains to try to give people a better idea past

7
00:00:56,865 --> 00:01:00,365
just the term F1 and F2 and all that and just

8
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,365
brief ideas of what it means.

9
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,132
Yeah, Yeah.

10
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,698
Because last week we, you know, we did a fairly textbook

11
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:12,066
overview of various concepts in breeding theory, in science.

12
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:15,498
And so this week we're definitely getting

13
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,033
more concrete, We're definitely getting into

14
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:21,266
some of the actual real life examples

15
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,533
of breeding and different real life scenarios.

16
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,165
And yeah, I thought I think one way we can begin

17
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:33,765
is we did talk briefly about,

18
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,533
for example, last week how

19
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:38,832
we don't

20
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,932
it's rare to find a true F1 hybrid in cannabis, for example.

21
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,133
And we talked about how

22
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:50,232
that Mendelian model of true F1 hybrids

23
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,933
and then F2 gene with

24
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:57,632
genotypic segregation

25
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:00,965
doesn't happen really in cannabis.

26
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:05,532
So I think Matt wanted to address some of that and we can start with the F1.

27
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:11,066
Matt Yeah, you know, what are examples of F1 in our world?

28
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:16,565
And so to make them so I'll start really with what they should be

29
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,866
and how they would be made in

30
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,832
terms of actual agricultural breeding versus cannabis.

31
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,765
So the definition of an F1, we went over that last week, it's,

32
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:33,632
it's crossing two distinctly different genotypes together essentially.

33
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:33,866
Right.

34
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:38,533
Like you're crossing two stabilized genotypes together is the idea

35
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:42,066
but yeah, two distinctly different

36
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,133
specifically that's very very key because in cannabis it's used differently.

37
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:50,132
So in this idea you would want to take a Thailand race,

38
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,299
something very,

39
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,466
very long flowering Thai for example, or Burmese

40
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:59,966
or any of that kind of stuff, and cross it to something

41
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:04,299
traditionally more Afghani that's interbred

42
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,498
or in this example,

43
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:10,332
let's say any Afghani or do

44
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:13,566
any Afghani do from like a land race region.

45
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,566
So that would be a real F1 hybrid.

46
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:23,066
And by crossing those two inbred lines, that's where you would get hybrid vigor.

47
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,598
And that's why when people talk about hybrid vigor and cannabis

48
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,566
and it doesn't really necessarily apply

49
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:32,033
because cannabis is naturally vigorous anyways.

50
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:35,032
And most of the things that we see in cannabis are poly hybrids.

51
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:40,998
So what we see in cannabis when we see F1 typically and even I use this

52
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,933
this way because it's it's how it's commonly understood in trying to

53
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,665
make it anything different, even by calling it a poly hybrid F1,

54
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,665
it would totally confuse everyone and it does when you do it

55
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,399
as people understand it, is that it is just two

56
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,866
different strains cross to each other and cannabis simply put,

57
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,432
two different unrelated strains

58
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:05,699
and technically is even related.

59
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:06,499
Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:07,998
And technically that is correct too.

61
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,332
So call those if once

62
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,265
we're just distinguishing that

63
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:17,865
from the true F1 hybrids type F1, right?

64
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:18,565
Correct.

65
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,565
I mean, it's a commonly accepted I don't know if it's correct.

66
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:24,865
I don't know if it's even correct to call it correct, but it's accepted.

67
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,466
I think it is. Yeah, I think it is.

68
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:31,598
I think I did look at up to be like four polys, so probably so

69
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:36,498
it wasn't uncommon for like the heterozygous or poly hybrids crosses.

70
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,165
I think they're still

71
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:41,165
technically advanced, but I will say that we're not entirely sure.

72
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,432
But yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:46,432
I mean, it's just, it's just because F1 have to be two distinct genotypes.

74
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,399
I don't know how they describe that for heterozygous.

75
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:51,432
It's, it's a major

76
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:55,432
I think fashion I think the F1 still designates

77
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:59,165
the filial generational generation regarded as distinct from.

78
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,966
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay.

79
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,399
So then it is we if that's the case then it's being used correctly in cannabis

80
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,733
if that's the case.

81
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,766
And yeah, so in this example

82
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,699
most people would say like

83
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,432
OG Kush crossed

84
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:17,832
you purple Urkel, whatever, if they're seed lines, you know,

85
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,799
male female seed lines, you would call that an F1 in cannabis,

86
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,333
a great example of a real F1

87
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,566
in cannabis, as I see it would be something

88
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:33,498
that CSA is currently working on, which is his land race.

89
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,932
For me, that was from Preservation dude and crossing that to the Christmas tree.

90
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:44,165
But eyeball line, which is it is to the point of where

91
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:48,098
if you if you pop seedlings from it and you run clones of those seedlings

92
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,231
of each different seedling at the clonal level they all look pretty uniform.

93
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:55,231
You know, it's different when they're seedlings and seedlings

94
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,632
as most people know, seedlings

95
00:05:56,632 --> 00:06:00,966
like as they grow up and mature and you take clones of them, they change.

96
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,399
Like the clone is not usually the same exact plant.

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,865
But the thing is, it's very rare and in clonal form.

98
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:11,199
They all seem to line up pretty well, looking like clones of each other.

99
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,799
So it is it is a, I think, idle by definition for cannabis.

100
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,499
So that would be a good example of a true F1 hybrid in cannabis.

101
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,065
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:25,365
And just to clarify, I think what we are trying to point out

103
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:29,899
is that when F1 is when the term F1 is used,

104
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,999
they are actually two possible interpretations or

105
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,498
meanings.

106
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:38,165
One of that is the true

107
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:41,331
F1 hybrids in the Mendelian sense that that's trying to get at.

108
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:44,432
And then there is F1 in, in,

109
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,432
in designating the familial generation

110
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,199
and nothing beyond that.

111
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,098
So in cannabis most of the time it is the latter,

112
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:56,632
but there are exceptions like the one Matt just gave.

113
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,765
Yes, there's always exceptions to every rule on that.

114
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,899
And in cannabis it always finds a way to have an exception.

115
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,732
Yeah, okay.

116
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:08,799
How about an F2?

117
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:14,498
So F2 essentially is taking the progeny, the resulting seeds or progeny

118
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:18,031
of that F1 hybrid, popping those seeds,

119
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:22,565
selecting a male and a female or essentially a male and a female

120
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,831
to keep it simple, a male and a female

121
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,831
and crossing them together,

122
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:33,932
resulting in the F2 generation, the second fairly old generation.

123
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:38,732
And as it goes on to F3 four or five, it's just that same process each

124
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:41,766
next generation selecting male or female, but the next generation.

125
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:44,766
And hopefully you're selecting four traits if you're working them

126
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:48,466
generations, that usually helps take it a direction.

127
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,731
Yeah.

128
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:58,299
Is there are there good examples of F2 or like F2 has been used for you?

129
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:01,632
No particular reasons. Okay.

130
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:07,732
So an example of an F2 would be like with the blue bonnet I got.

131
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:12,266
So if you see to the F1 to pop that I wanted to immediately do F2

132
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,065
and that was to open it up and see what

133
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,065
what's actually in the blue bonnet.

134
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,231
Yeah that's that, that's the perfect example

135
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,232
of why you would take something to an F2

136
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,399
and I didn't necessarily want to open up the whole thing

137
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,999
for, say, like by doing an open pollination

138
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,966
because I already knew the direction I wanted to go

139
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,132
and they were already showing those traits.

140
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:39,565
So hopefully that sense of that.

141
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:40,266
Yeah.

142
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:43,265
And the F like we've mentioned before,

143
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,831
that's where you're likely to see a greater proportion of recessive

144
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:52,265
and greater

145
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,266
the greater kind of variation

146
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:58,631
in the permutations of, of genes.

147
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:01,098
Right. Exactly.

148
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:01,999
Yeah.

149
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,266
Yep. Go.

150
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:04,631
All right.

151
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:07,631
I think the next one we want to move on to was the S1,

152
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,399
S1 and I think there are many, many, many examples of this.

153
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:12,231
Yeah.

154
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:14,365
So that would be specifically self.

155
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:15,665
And a lot of people get this confused.

156
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,666
They think all families seeds are S1

157
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:22,798
whereas all S1 are feminized

158
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:26,499
is true, whereas vise vice versa is not.

159
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,632
So in S1 means self.

160
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:33,365
It's when you take a essentially take a clone of a

161
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:37,566
of a single plant, you take two clones, you reverse one

162
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:41,932
using any number of methods to cause it to show male flowers,

163
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:46,066
you pollinate another clone of itself and harvest the resulting seeds.

164
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:48,331
That would be a self generation.

165
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:53,698
Good examples of a self generation would be like the Chem 91 S1 from KCI,

166
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,166
the heirloom Afghani ones that I did,

167
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,531
and essentially

168
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:05,032
you do get to see the recessive despite it being self.

169
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:08,765
So a lot of people like to compare the S1 generation

170
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:12,998
to the F two generation because you're seeing the recessive.

171
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:18,732
However, you're still narrowing stuff down while seeing the recessive in an S2,

172
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:23,698
whereas in an F two that's not necessarily what's happening all the time.

173
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:24,565
You meant S1 right?

174
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,566
By S2 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,298
And it got to suck.

176
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:31,031
It's going to get these.

177
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:32,831
Yeah, well, I was going to say as well,

178
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,731
while you are also likely to find resources in US ones,

179
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,966
you also have a chance of finding things

180
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,966
very much like the plot you're reversing.

181
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:46,598
You have to find things very similar.

182
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:51,032
A lot of people understand it to mean that you're going to find

183
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:54,532
exact copies of and that's that's definitely not the case.

184
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,265
But you'll find things very similar and some may look identical,

185
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,265
you know, but it doesn't say it's an exact genetic con.

186
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:06,265
I mean, it's worth saying this right, Like any any CS that you make, regardless

187
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:10,432
of how you make them, you will never, ever get genetically identical

188
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,764
progeny.

189
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:13,032
Yeah.

190
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,799
I mean, it's like this with humans

191
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:18,399
when I impregnate myself, the resulting babies don't look like me.

192
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:19,164
I've tried.

193
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:21,399
This doesn't work very well.

194
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,565
I. I struggle to imagine what they would look like.

195
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,599
Beautiful, though. They're beautiful.

196
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,599
Yes. They're

197
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:32,764
bright spots.

198
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,731
Okay. Yeah.

199
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:35,598
All right.

200
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:39,965
And also, you know, worth mentioning, we have obviously addressed reversals

201
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:41,731
and not just reversals.

202
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,064
We've addressed self in quite a bit.

203
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:47,099
So yep, if you want to hear more about it, if my reference to the last

204
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:50,331
two episodes, we talk about something in both of them

205
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:54,865
and the next set of examples is the S2

206
00:11:56,164 --> 00:12:00,365
S2 trying to think, you know, actually,

207
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:04,432
as I gave an example for S1 for the Chem 91 S1

208
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,465
more than actually S2 was.

209
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,899
Yes, I want to point that out too.

210
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,264
So I think while it is a great example of like

211
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:18,198
a release of an S1, I probably should have referenced something like

212
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,532
Jesus, not even I was thinking Jesus last ones.

213
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,899
But that's probably an S2 too.

214
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,965
So it's like there's a lot of things out there from clones that we buy

215
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:29,965
as S1 that might be used, but because

216
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,932
history hasn't quite proven

217
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,932
that out to be fleshed out for sure,

218
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,365
there are labeled as what we know them to be,

219
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:42,164
which would be the first true self generation that we can prove.

220
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:42,831
Right?

221
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:45,099
So that's in that case they would be referred to as S1,

222
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:48,099
but in theory some of that stuff is eschews.

223
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:52,031
And as a good example, probably 91, because it's so uniform

224
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:56,099
as an S1 is a good example of why it is probably in S2,

225
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:59,432
but you don't see a lot of real S2 is being released or sold.

226
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:01,831
So that's why I'm kind of

227
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,965
stretching it a bit to try to find something that really fits in right there.

228
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:09,131
I think there's there's a cool general point in there, though, which is that

229
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:13,699
if you don't know what you starting with, what you what your like

230
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:17,599
starting material actually is what generation it actually is,

231
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:23,198
the best you get in cannabis land is a relative kind of designation.

232
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,031
So a reboot and not knowing what the Chem 91 actually is,

233
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:30,832
all we can say when you self is that it is an S1 quote unquote.

234
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:33,664
But in actuality it may be an S too.

235
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:37,231
But you know, because we did that and in reference to that,

236
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:40,231
the blue bonnet itself was supposed to be a

237
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,465
a blueberry pure works, you know.

238
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:47,764
And if you go by who had it, you know, deejays short I think to Vic

239
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:51,965
or to Johnny from Sigur Mapoe to Vic I to Lone Star.

240
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:55,599
To me, that's a lot of generations that were working there.

241
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:59,099
I mean, DG released it at F four and supposedly,

242
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:02,532
you know, I mean, there's many generations in there, so

243
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:06,065
it's really hard to say on that.

244
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:09,232
Like what generation it really was.

245
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:12,032
Yeah, Yeah.

246
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:15,399
And come back to this Fuze has our old mate Caleb

247
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,631
done this to work was he I know he's talked about it before.

248
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:24,164
Yeah he has but it's not often released so it's kind of hard to reference it.

249
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,365
But yeah there's been there's been several things you stand to and taken

250
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,432
to S3 where the the population of seed

251
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:33,699
seems to just be and viable like they don't pop at S3.

252
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:37,865
I don't think that's always the case but it has happened.

253
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,999
Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,965
Okay. Very cool.

255
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,965
All right, next one is the F1. Ah

256
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:48,331
F1 order. So. Yeah. What is that?

257
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:52,399
That's a designation that we use in cannabis specifically,

258
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:58,265
and it's only to denote reversal so that when us is breeders and this is not

259
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,365
science talk now this is like for

260
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,432
sure our own nomenclature that we instituted.

261
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:05,165
Right.

262
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,865
So it's, it's so when breeders are looking at stuff,

263
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,764
we know if we're referencing,

264
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:12,965
if I'm looking at someone's writing, I know if they're referencing a male

265
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,131
in their line

266
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:18,064
or if they're referencing a reversal in their line by that designation.

267
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:21,899
So it's something that we started doing so that we know in each other's work

268
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,899
what we're referring to, if we're going to work with each other's work

269
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,232
and hopefully more people instituted over time because it's very helpful

270
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:32,465
and it's important and it gets more and more important as more people come in.

271
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,465
I mean, just as important as trying to illustrate that you put

272
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:38,865
the male second, you know, you never put the male first.

273
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,331
It always comes after the female.

274
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,365
But even that isn't like strictly adhere to that.

275
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:45,965
I see it in cannabis.

276
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:49,232
I mean, we're trying to institute some things to make it more

277
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,231
easier to read

278
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:54,231
or legible, scientifically legible for all of us.

279
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:55,264
Well, yeah.

280
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,831
I mean, and you have a consistent set of terms

281
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,164
that makes it actually possible to communicate effectively with other people.

282
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:02,764
Yeah, exactly.

283
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,399
And not in not having met.

284
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,365
I mean, that's how we got here, right?

285
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,365
Well, I like the messy state that we're in right now.

286
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,499
And while in what they're saying

287
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:15,831
is true, it's technically not part of, say, the Mendelian science.

288
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:19,564
It's still very important to designate and the discourse

289
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:23,199
of practitioners and the community of practitioners.

290
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,298
So yeah, yeah, cannabis is so different than a lot of other plants.

291
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:29,464
And because it's been

292
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:33,165
kept out of the science room for so long due to its illegal classification,

293
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,432
a lot of us were the ones trying to write this stuff

294
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:39,664
and understand it from the point of view of people who are not collegiate,

295
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,831
you know, but just trying to do the best we can with what we had and

296
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:48,432
it's interesting is that runs headlong into science

297
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:53,032
and trying to adopt that in and seeing seen if they even give a shit

298
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:56,065
on anything we've done which is not very likely.

299
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:59,865
Yeah, and it's not an uncommon thing you know in other fields of practice,

300
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,965
especially ones that are not science based,

301
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:07,531
it's still very necessary to come up with your own taxonomy

302
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:10,832
instead of terms for the reasons I mentioned earlier.

303
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,664
So and

304
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,197
a good example of an F1 are would be

305
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:19,765
when we had the sour dub and we reversed the diesel to it.

306
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,698
Diesel and Sour Dub or not directly related.

307
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:28,032
And yeah, that's it made for amazing progeny

308
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:31,332
and we find that that happens a lot.

309
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,298
Rascal Ogi rascal made his career

310
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:38,798
making a lot of like reverse hybrids for reverse feminized hybrids like that.

311
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,198
Some of the best earliest feminist reverse feminist hybrids were his.

312
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:46,932
So yeah, in modern times you have catturato doing great stuff with that as well.

313
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:48,665
Yeah.

314
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:52,731
And I would say that F1 cars are very common, right?

315
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,332
Yeah, very, very hot market now.

316
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:58,065
Yeah. Especially now.

317
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:58,898
Okay.

318
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:03,231
Um, next one, the b, x or B C back cross.

319
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:04,631
Okay back.

320
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,332
So we did touch on this last week.

321
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:07,598
Yes. Yeah.

322
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:10,597
And it's essentially just taking,

323
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,998
trying to think how to word this best anywhere

324
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:18,465
I can do this one because I think if you want to write pretty well Yeah so

325
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,064
the goal of a back cross is

326
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:25,432
you are trying to bring in one stable trait

327
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:29,031
into an already stable parent.

328
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:31,698
That parent is called the recurrent parent.

329
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:34,698
It's the one that you are crossing to

330
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:40,065
and you have the integrative parent, which is the one that you're trying to take.

331
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:41,298
That one trait from.

332
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:45,798
That was really good.

333
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,132
That was really good. I'm impressed.

334
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:51,498
So yeah, so an example of of that cross

335
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,597
one would be something like let's see what we could be ex

336
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:58,597
what he used as an example.

337
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,397
I don't want to keep using Bluebonnet

338
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:04,397
so I'm going to switch it up and go to like strawberry cream.

339
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,065
Strawberry cream was a line developed by CVS work

340
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,265
several generations and was pretty close to too breeding.

341
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:16,432
True, especially with the clone we had even we out cross-stitch Strawberry

342
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:19,565
was very dominant and that was the trait we wanted to lock in.

343
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,398
We knew that we we happened to have been growing

344
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:26,664
Santa Cruz blue Dream right next to it and noticed that they were very similar.

345
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:30,164
The Santa Cruz blue Dream was a female.

346
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:34,832
At this point, I wanted to have a regular seed line, a strawberry cream and CVS had

347
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:38,697
gone, taken a hiatus and I didn't have any regular seeds of it.

348
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:42,265
So we took a male, Johnny Blaze,

349
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:46,198
which was a Blueberry Neville case, which is similar

350
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:50,632
to blueberry super silver Haze that was used for Santa Cruz Blue Dream.

351
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:54,664
And we outgrossed that and then brought it back to the strawberry

352
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:57,865
or that cross we brought back to the strawberry

353
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,731
cream clone and it produced consistent strawberry tears.

354
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:04,165
So that would be an example of an effective

355
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,565
back cross. What

356
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:08,865
nice.

357
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,565
Yeah.

358
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:10,998
Okay.

359
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:14,965
And the final one that we wanted to touch on for this

360
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,064
warm up was an N cross.

361
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:21,565
I bring two different little generations, right?

362
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:22,932
Yeah.

363
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:27,432
So it's it's not dissimilar to a cross in many ways,

364
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:31,232
but that cross is an example of an end cross.

365
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:35,065
However, usually an end cross is referred to in cannabis specifically.

366
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:38,332
And again, this is one of those the nomenklatura here from cannabis

367
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:43,565
is referring to like taking an F4 and crossing it

368
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:46,965
back to the F two generation A selection from the F word generation and

369
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:50,764
let's say you have traits you like that are showing up in an F for male

370
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:55,265
or you had an F two female that you really liked that in that case

371
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:58,398
you would use the F for mail for you and that would be considered for us

372
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,831
an example of this.

373
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:04,465
We had J shorts, a blueberry

374
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,865
seed mine, and we had a selection from it that was very blueberry but very modern.

375
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:08,597
J Shorts.

376
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:13,964
Blueberry, which to me means like the the butthole trips,

377
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:17,198
like the nasty turkey with slight berry,

378
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:20,432
but very beautiful to look at purple,

379
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:23,065
short, squat, indica.

380
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,698
And we crossed

381
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,798
that to the blue bonnet, which is, in my opinion,

382
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,065
a hybrid of blueberry, but very, very dominant for the blueberry terms.

383
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:38,198
And so in doing this, my goal was to make one that looked like a modern line.

384
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,432
They had the smell of everything everybody wants from blueberry

385
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,132
and a much stronger high.

386
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:47,432
And in order to do that, I did a what we called an increase

387
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,097
because that's the best way we could define it as since

388
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:53,097
it was given to me as a pure blueberry line, even though my,

389
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:56,164
my suspicions are that it's the bonnet is not

390
00:21:56,198 --> 00:22:00,798
because it was given to me is that I have to consider it and cross

391
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:02,131
because I don't want to just like

392
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,332
say that I know something

393
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:05,898
that someone else is saying is incorrect, but I don't have fruit.

394
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:08,765
I think that's a really good example.

395
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:12,898
Could I press you to generalize and tell us, like,

396
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:17,565
what are the overall benefits of using this method?

397
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:21,765
I mean, the overall benefits are if you're not seeing certain traits

398
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:24,498
pop up in the after, you let's say you run a population

399
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:27,065
of the F two generation, you don't see anything in the males

400
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,898
from that generation that you necessarily like,

401
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:32,798
but you've already like you've already taken things generations out, like in high

402
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,064
lessons example or in his case, he has his Appalachia and he worked at,

403
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:41,198
I think five or six and then didn't like necessarily what you've seen.

404
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:44,098
So he went back, popped more f twos.

405
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:48,964
At this point, if he doesn't find anything and you know, in those ff2

406
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:50,264
realm that he like,

407
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,398
he could have popped some of the F six look for male

408
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:54,830
and they're showing the traits that he liked and use that

409
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,997
and hope that it bred like

410
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:58,930
wow that's super interesting.

411
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:01,030
I don't think I've actually

412
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,798
thought about this that much this this particular strategy

413
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:07,964
Very cool yeah

414
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,264
I think that brings us

415
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,698
at the end of this little intro section, this sort of warm up. Yes.

416
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:18,964
Was there anything else you wanted to add on any of these men?

417
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,365
No, I think that's it.

418
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,265
I think that was a I just wanted to give a quick

419
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:26,465
jaunt with some like examples, hypotheticals, maybe.

420
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,964
I don't know.

421
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:30,097
I think that I think was really good.

422
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:30,865
Right.

423
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:34,865
And I think in the next section, we're going to take it one step further

424
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:38,365
in terms of

425
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,464
examples and scenarios.

426
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:44,230
And we've got a bunch of questions from the discord.

427
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:46,431
That's right.

428
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:49,898
We are going to begin with Kristen Scarecrow in the.

429
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:51,830
Okay. So he's got a

430
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:57,765
he's going to keep a triangle choke individual

431
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,397
and in his words, it brought the best traits from each of the parents

432
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,897
heavy amount of high quality resin and a nice high from the TC

433
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,698
great blueberry flavor from the bonnet diesel bringing great flower structure

434
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,330
and also augmenting the smell and flavor.

435
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:18,730
So he doesn't want to use this keeper in crisis.

436
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,565
Yet as he's scared to lose that particular combination of traits.

437
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:25,565
And what he's thinking about

438
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:29,965
is going through more packs to find another similar individual to the keeper

439
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:36,064
that he's got and may be doing a sibling cross or maybe an F2 are. Now.

440
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:40,065
What do we think about his proposed approach?

441
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:45,030
If his goal is to produce more homogenous stock that represents his keeper?

442
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:47,998
So there's a

443
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:50,998
few steps to this that I that I would ask him first

444
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,330
and it would be, are you sure

445
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,430
that this is the ultimate expression from that line that you want to see?

446
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:58,565
Like, is it as extreme blueberry,

447
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:02,498
Is it as potent, Is it as resinous as you want?

448
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:04,898
And I've seen I've seen examples of this and it's okay, it's fun.

449
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,397
It's an amazing example.

450
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:10,298
So in this case, knowing what his example is,

451
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:14,698
I'd say, go ahead, pop more seeds and look.

452
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:17,698
And if you don't see something immediately in there

453
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:21,397
that you that you think can be cloned and,

454
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,998
you know, grown more and then and might compete or be better,

455
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,197
I would not do any of those

456
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:32,365
and I would probably not cross it and I would

457
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,597
I would probably self it.

458
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:37,664
I mean, if you wanted to have a uniform

459
00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:41,164
homogeneous line of that specific expression,

460
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:45,964
taking it through the generations, through regular seeds

461
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,230
would be a little bit trickier because you're going to have

462
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,498
to pick a male if it lines up with a lot of those traits,

463
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:54,465
or you're just going to be constantly, constantly like taking a step back,

464
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:55,298
taking, you know,

465
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:58,298
two steps back, one step forward, two steps back, one step forward.

466
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:00,365
It's very easy to have that happen,

467
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:04,097
especially with a line that is a poly hybrid like that.

468
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:08,097
So I really recommend self for that example and it'll take it

469
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:11,198
more homogeneous quicker in the direction he wants,

470
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:16,565
and you won't have to pop as many to really keep narrowing it down.

471
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:19,664
Yeah,

472
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:22,664
yeah. So

473
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:27,431
I was also wondering if he did make s ones and okay,

474
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,065
let's say that he did pop out a few more from these other packs that he's got

475
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:35,765
and he did find another similar individual.

476
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:39,365
Is there anything else he can do with that to help

477
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,097
this kind of homogenization, or is that just not ultimately going to be helpful?

478
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:45,698
Like could his self both and then cross the s once?

479
00:26:45,698 --> 00:26:48,298
Like, you know what? What does that do?

480
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:51,365
Oh, the only way that I would recommend only the reason I would recommend that is

481
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:56,164
if you found another one that they had such drastic potency

482
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:02,665
but was equal in smell and resin production

483
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,197
to the one that he was keeping, but it was drastically more potent.

484
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:09,665
But or maybe it was slightly less smelly than the other one,

485
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:10,897
but along the same lines

486
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:13,930
and maybe slightly less resonance, but along the same lines of the close.

487
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,630
In that case, like I could understand, crossing the

488
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:19,631
to to try to absorb one of the traits and not wear out the other two.

489
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,230
But even that still just

490
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,365
I mean, you're still risking just opening it up again, right?

491
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:26,698
Yeah.

492
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:30,831
So I mean, I would still probably just as one the best of the two

493
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:35,497
or the best of the five or however many of the keepers are very similar

494
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:38,631
or what have you.

495
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:39,531
Cool.

496
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,931
Yeah.

497
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:41,265
Okay.

498
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:46,031
And he's got a follow up and this one is a bit broader.

499
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:48,798
He's asking

500
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,631
I think he's asking you in particular, because obviously, you know, the parents

501
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:55,898
and he's he's wondering like do you have a sense of what would out cross Well

502
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,064
to his his triangle choke individual.

503
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,264
I think so. Okay.

504
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,263
He does say something he says,

505
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:08,064
yeah having extremes of the parents and having actually sampled

506
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:12,364
are the types that might play well with it, i.e.

507
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:17,764
other plants that may not dominate but would still complement it well.

508
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,430
Yeah.

509
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,730
So this is like a lot of the reason I was doing some of the blueberry

510
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,431
or the blue bonnet, like hybrid cross work, like where I was taking

511
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:32,030
the blue bonnet, skittles that we had made

512
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,030
and crossing it to the blue Mac one that we made,

513
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:40,097
crossing the punchy blue stirred the silver pearl bluebonnet

514
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:44,364
the cream that we made to try to see how those two crossed together.

515
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,998
And every single time it seems to be moving forward

516
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:50,463
that the blueberry chirps very heavily, except for in the

517
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,898
in the silver pearl one silver pearl tended to dominate mostly,

518
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:56,063
but the berries still loose for it.

519
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:59,163
I can still find them in there, which is not as dominant as a silver.

520
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,463
With that said, like, I really think like the first thing

521
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:05,463
that comes to my mind if you don't have any males that you like

522
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:08,663
that immediately show all the traits.

523
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,663
Like I said, it's really hard to select for and to know

524
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,030
if you don't know the line real well.

525
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:19,264
Things like the white bonnet complement that real well because it'll keep

526
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:23,897
the resin production, the potency and the males from that.

527
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,930
I've already found males that are dominant for the the blueberry

528
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,897
scented expression and flavor.

529
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:32,897
So I know that it can dominate the white.

530
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,198
Things like that immediately come to mind.

531
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:35,998
But again,

532
00:29:35,998 --> 00:29:39,064
that's bringing in more genetics, that's bringing in more outside genetics.

533
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:42,064
But if you're if like if you're insisting on having a regular seed line,

534
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:44,298
I would either use the triangle choke male

535
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:47,463
and really hope for it there, or if you're trying to drive in the blueberry tops,

536
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:51,563
which I know he really wants to do, I use something like another body

537
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:55,563
hybrid of the same line, like I said, or something like the white bonnet.

538
00:29:56,498 --> 00:29:58,498
I don't think I knew you. You had a wife on it.

539
00:29:58,498 --> 00:30:00,398
Just saying, Yeah, I can't really sell much.

540
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:01,597
I just passed them out.

541
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:03,663
Gotcha.

542
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:05,963
Yeah.

543
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:06,431
Okay.

544
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,431
I think that is more or less Kristen's

545
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,763
question is anything else you would recommend

546
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:17,463
one to add to his kind of set of parameters or.

547
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:21,897
No, I mean, any other kind of like weird pots

548
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:24,897
you could go down for fun or like,

549
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:28,230
I mean, you can always try the male selection.

550
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,730
Like I said, it's it's I recommend everybody do it.

551
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,364
That's where you learn the line.

552
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,998
Try it. Yeah.

553
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,264
And but other than that like itself because I know his goal

554
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:40,263
and what he wants to do, it's hard to recommend him to do anything else or

555
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:43,331
because I know exactly what he wants to get done with it

556
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,330
and it's a great cut like of, of all the

557
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:49,764
the stuff people have sent me in.

558
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:53,663
Like, that's one of the ones that made me sleep like, hardcore, put me out.

559
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:55,597
It's pretty good. It's pretty good.

560
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,697
Very nice.

561
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:02,464
Okay, so I think we can move on to our next question.

562
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,730
And this one's from Kyle Tyrrell.

563
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,163
He has a pack of banana tie response.

564
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:12,498
And maybe before we go any further, would you like to tell us what the banana ties?

565
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,663
Okay, so the banana tie was a juicy fruit

566
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:18,663
tie that came from a local place.

567
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:22,764
And when I picked it up, it was a it was a local club

568
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:26,497
and I just thought there was no way other is no way that these people would

569
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:29,798
one know what a tie was or what Juicy Fruit tie was.

570
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:34,730
But it didn't look very quote unquote secure typically city, too.

571
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:37,798
So I took it home and it was definitely

572
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,897
a tie dominant plant that had been worked.

573
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,998
Probably I my best guess would be sensi seeds

574
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:49,098
type juicy fruit chai and it smelled like juicy fruit gum.

575
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,298
It can be taken anywhere between 11 to 14 weeks

576
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:56,298
depending on where people take it, where they like it.

577
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,163
But it was explosively speedy high.

578
00:31:59,163 --> 00:32:02,064
It is not not play around happy

579
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:05,364
tie like I assumed it would be is very potent.

580
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:08,364
And the banana tie was that crust or platinum banana.

581
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,730
One male.

582
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,663
Very cool.

583
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:15,663
Okay, so continuing on with Kyle's question,

584
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:18,898
he's got two keepers of his banana tie.

585
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,363
This one's

586
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:23,764
one keeper has a no ceiling high,

587
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:27,497
the juicy fruit smell and taste, but poor structure.

588
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:28,498
Yeah.

589
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:32,530
The second keeper has better structure and yields tropical fruit

590
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,230
and banana chirps, but a lower ceiling for the high, which he doesn't like.

591
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:36,898
Yeah.

592
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,063
And so what he's hoping

593
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:41,698
is to bring the structure and yield from the second one into the first one

594
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:43,931
and what he's thinking about.

595
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:44,831
So that's the goal, right.

596
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,363
And what he's thinking about doing is reversing and then combining

597
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:53,030
the two keepers in both ways and then maybe also slicing each of them

598
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,397
to look through.

599
00:32:54,397 --> 00:32:57,397
That's yeah, I mean, that's great.

600
00:32:57,431 --> 00:32:59,097
That's actually a really good example.

601
00:32:59,097 --> 00:32:59,763
I think, of

602
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:01,398
of how to

603
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:04,497
do that, how to how to lock in both traits.

604
00:33:04,498 --> 00:33:07,864
And that line is a hard one that lines are really tough one

605
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:11,898
because it uses incorporates banana OG you and I've talked about banana O.G.

606
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,931
a little bit in the past on the show but

607
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:18,564
in Banana OG there are some beautifully banana smelling stuff.

608
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:21,797
There are some beautifully OG Kush smelling stuff,

609
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:26,763
There's combinations of both, and then there's like this 60%

610
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:30,864
ratio clip of just lando's

611
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:33,997
dunk one just land, land.

612
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:36,797
I mean, it's, it's got a decent high, but it's just so bland

613
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:40,797
and it's not really super appealing to anyone, not super resinous, super bland

614
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,297
In the juicy fruit tie in the outer crosses.

615
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:45,663
There is a lot of that too.

616
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:49,696
There's low odor, low to

617
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,296
like just semi-sweet plants in there.

618
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:58,596
But there are like that clone example just ripping and it has a beautiful smell.

619
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,530
So in that banana tie knew there would be stuff that would be variant.

620
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,797
And then you have like what we talk about a high ceiling, low floor

621
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:11,697
as far as what to expect, not to say high, but what to expect from the progeny.

622
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,364
So I ended up giving them away for the most part.

623
00:34:15,364 --> 00:34:18,264
But then the demand got pretty big, so we auctioned off a few

624
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,530
after a few years of it being out.

625
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,764
But in the SE ones we use really good examples of it.

626
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,097
So in the ones

627
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:31,164
it should be easy enough to do

628
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:35,031
like a sister crosses of the water and lock in some traits that way.

629
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,797
I think it's a great idea.

630
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:37,396
Yeah.

631
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:40,463
I guess it'll also be interesting to see how easy

632
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:43,931
it will be or not to to reverse some of these as well.

633
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:45,630
Absolutely.

634
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,931
Yeah. Because you just never know.

635
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,463
You never know what's going to drop pollen or not.

636
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:52,931
I should point out, by the way, that we did

637
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:57,731
not manipulate people into using that work for any of these questions.

638
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:01,797
That is just you go from this like we're all from this small community.

639
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,864
And so, you know, people are growing, a lot of people growing that work.

640
00:35:04,864 --> 00:35:08,963
And that's why that's how it grows, how we're not doing some kind of like

641
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:12,997
underhanded marketing, although I think Matt will still take it.

642
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:14,396
Yeah, I'll take it.

643
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:17,596
I mean, you know, if you do a contest, if people want to Vietnam,

644
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:22,364
I feel like organizing contests

645
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:25,131
online must be really difficult.

646
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,230
It's so hard, man.

647
00:35:26,231 --> 00:35:31,064
It's just like even doing like the small giveaway contests, like on IG,

648
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:34,064
we found that like there is almost no way to do it

649
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:37,297
without a second person immediately complaining that they want

650
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:40,596
like we just never had it happen without that happening.

651
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,197
It was crazy that immediately we're in kindergarten

652
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:46,564
and like I was first I was working on my screen first.

653
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,263
So it's hard. It's like herding cats.

654
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:53,164
Yeah, I think even like, even more complicated,

655
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,164
like the idea of, like, trying to run like, a little mini cup,

656
00:35:56,731 --> 00:36:00,731
you know, and like, getting samples sent around and just thinking about

657
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:04,797
all the different steps in the logistics and how much could go wrong at every step.

658
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:08,896
And like not being able to guarantee like much really.

659
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:14,064
But I remember one of the Adam Dunn cups,

660
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:18,830
one of my friends mailed the example and it got

661
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:22,864
it got stuck at the post office and we didn't know why.

662
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:24,963
We did not have a clue why.

663
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,264
We just knew that we had to go there

664
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:29,697
and pick it up at the post office and he had to present his I.D.

665
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,197
to do it.

666
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:32,597
And I remember looking, I'm like, Are you going to run to do this?

667
00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:35,431
Like as we pulled out of the post, I was like, Is it really worth it?

668
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:37,264
Like, we don't know why they're keeping it.

669
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:40,264
It turned out they were keeping it because it was like short a dollar,

670
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:41,797
like and postage.

671
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:43,463
But like one of the things you're like,

672
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:46,197
you know, things are going to give you fucking weed, that girl.

673
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:47,364
So yeah, there's all kinds of things

674
00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:50,396
you can go crazy with those competitions, just that alone, you know?

675
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,396
Yeah, I can only imagine.

676
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:55,563
I mean, I would.

677
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,864
I wouldn't mind seeing someone try, but I'm not going to.

678
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,963
I don't think I'm going to get involved.

679
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:03,963
And yeah, it was wild.

680
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:05,563
All right.

681
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:11,263
Well, okay, so we've got another question from scientist and this one.

682
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:12,631
My apologies. I don't know.

683
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,630
I hope I've interpreted his question correctly.

684
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,864
There are quite a few moving parts to his one, so I'll do my best.

685
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:23,063
So his story is

686
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:26,063
he was given some seeds a few years ago,

687
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:29,664
a set of blueberry seeds from one of his friends,

688
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:32,197
and I believe he said

689
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:35,197
it was from the nineties.

690
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,931
So he's essentially

691
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:43,530
wanting to extend his buddies blueberry work and see what

692
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,331
kinds of traits exist in this lineage that his friend has been working with.

693
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:51,764
And part

694
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:54,764
of the way that he wants to learn about them

695
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:58,963
is by crossing them to other other lines.

696
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,864
So in addition to his friend's nineties blueberry seeds of unknown,

697
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:08,097
relatively unknown provenance, he's going to have to pick,

698
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,463
I think what he's saying he has two different pre

699
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:15,831
98 paper cuts maybe and he's also got some pea berry.

700
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,530
Yeah.

701
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:21,063
So what he's trying to do just to say again he wants to try them out

702
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:22,431
in different combinations

703
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:25,530
to learn more about his buddies blueberry that he got he was given

704
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:29,797
that's his initial question.

705
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:32,864
Okay.

706
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:36,497
Is that question.

707
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,463
I think they like,

708
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:42,463
I think what he's trying to ask is like,

709
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,631
do these crosses make sense?

710
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:51,196
Like, so I have to ask what can he what could he possibly learn doing?

711
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:52,597
Gotcha. So

712
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,630
he listed a few different Baba clones, right?

713
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:58,530
And that

714
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,497
and that's right. Listed it.

715
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:04,797
He was growing bonded after they bought it afterwards.

716
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:08,329
Then I think he said Pea berry, which is the Catsup Brother Bluebonnet

717
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:12,264
and I think he said the pre 90 Bubba Bluebonnet which is the bloodsuckers

718
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:16,264
and you can learn about all of those

719
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:18,730
if he knows Baba really well.

720
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,730
Those are excellent ways to figure out what's going on with this whole Miss

721
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,463
Blueberry First, if it's related to blueberry is a good question.

722
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,197
Is it is it related to just bluish?

723
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:30,896
Run it and bring it out.

724
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,663
Run out a bunch of these these blue bonnet

725
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,730
to see if anything's lining up at all, see if there's any trace laying it.

726
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,764
And if he knows Baba really well like

727
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:42,329
finding those Bubba Bluebonnets are so stable,

728
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:46,997
expression wise that like right there.

729
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:51,029
Great cross to out cross to anything to bring in potency and blueberry to

730
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:55,864
I know zebra from San Diego's finest cuts it's one of his more favorite

731
00:39:55,864 --> 00:40:00,197
lines is the blubber for that reason for male selection and breeding. So

732
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:03,797
yeah I know I think it's a good way to learn.

733
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:05,664
I mean like to to learn about it.

734
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:08,664
And if he knows Bubba those lines, I'll tell him more, you know?

735
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:09,864
Yeah.

736
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,864
And just to clarify as well, I imagine

737
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,530
just to leave like no stone unturned, so to speak, I imagine what he is going to do

738
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,064
is actually first run all those things out separately, right?

739
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:24,063
Like, yeah, he's not just going to like immediately cross them all.

740
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:24,497
Yeah.

741
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:27,529
And then try to figure out what's going on, because that would be pretty crazy

742
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,264
I got here. Yeah, Yeah.

743
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:33,764
So that's not the way The way is to run each of these

744
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:38,063
packs lines cuts out.

745
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:40,530
Look at them all separately, and then maybe after that,

746
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,397
you can try, like, crossing some of them and see what passes.

747
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:46,197
And, like, those lines are great.

748
00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:48,396
If he knows better,

749
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:52,364
it's like it's really easy to pick out the Bubba traits from the blue bonnet ones.

750
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,797
To me, I know Bubba really, really well, so that's why

751
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:58,630
you saw you may have actually covered this,

752
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,664
but his follow up was with the P berry help,

753
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:05,797
or would it just confuse things and slow, slow things down?

754
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,797
His goal is not to make seed for production, but just to learn about

755
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:12,197
that blueberry strain.

756
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:15,297
So anything you want to say about the P berry in particular,

757
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:20,164
the difference between the P berry and like the pre 98 Bubba from shore is

758
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:21,930
that the P berry?

759
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:25,596
I think that that Katsu Bubba is a hybrid of Bubba.

760
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:29,463
So it is different than

761
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,164
traditional.

762
00:41:31,164 --> 00:41:34,164
It's beautiful, it's purple,

763
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:36,564
but it is slightly different.

764
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:41,163
So I think that's I mean, if you know the Katsu Chi, it's still very Bubba ish,

765
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:45,464
but it has different like the way the Bud formations are is different

766
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:49,297
typically than than Bubba Crush, but the chirps are very similar.

767
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:52,264
It goes from that coffee

768
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:53,829
chocolaty coffee to

769
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:56,829
to the soapy cushy depending on how you grow it.

770
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:58,864
I mean, it's very similar.

771
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:01,864
I think both are really good directions.

772
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,030
It is so dominant, Bubba, so dominant in Katsu that,

773
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:06,663
you know, a lot of people would argue

774
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:08,497
whether it's a hybrid or not, but I'm pretty sure it is

775
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:12,996
okay.

776
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,997
I've got he actually I didn't see this,

777
00:42:15,996 --> 00:42:18,797
but you actually had another point that's kind of a wrench.

778
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,764
I this plan, in my opinion

779
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:24,364
and maybe it is good that I skipped over it, but now he's

780
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:27,663
now I might if he said he's limited to six flowering plants.

781
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:29,297
Karen,

782
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,164
you I said, well I mean you could do it.

783
00:42:31,164 --> 00:42:32,430
It's just going to take a long time.

784
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:34,230
Be patient.

785
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,996
So how, how many how would you approach that?

786
00:42:35,996 --> 00:42:38,129
Just kind of do it in pots, right?

787
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,829
Like, yeah, just yeah, in parts and keep a lot of clones.

788
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:45,197
Yeah. Yeah.

789
00:42:45,197 --> 00:42:46,197
I mean, I can relate.

790
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,097
I can relate, buddy.

791
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,630
Like, yes, it's not easy.

792
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,664
No it's not.

793
00:42:50,664 --> 00:42:53,664
And it takes time. Yeah.

794
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:54,829
Okay.

795
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:57,764
So anything else you want to add to this whole enterprise of like

796
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:01,996
or you think we've covered enough for scientists?

797
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:02,530
I just.

798
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,564
I just really like it because, like,

799
00:43:04,563 --> 00:43:07,196
one of the initial things that I was running with the pilot

800
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:10,230
bluebonnets, the white bonnets and a few others, they're basically

801
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,297
Afghani dominant blue bonnet crosses.

802
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:16,429
That was where I wanted

803
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:19,896
to initially take a lot of the lion's because itself

804
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:23,130
bodied is very traditionally Quraishi Afghani dominant.

805
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:27,829
So it's a good it's a good partner for it essentially.

806
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,597
So yeah, I like his idea.

807
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:34,497
I think the other thing I like about this question is that in some ways

808
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:38,263
he's actually not really that concerned about making seeds or

809
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:42,064
or breeding per se in this one scenario.

810
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:45,063
He's actually just talking about wanting to learn as much as possible,

811
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:49,630
which we did talk about last week as being extremely important

812
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,697
and like it's also extremely time consuming and resource intensive.

813
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:56,329
So it is admirable.

814
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,996
I think that something is like,

815
00:43:57,996 --> 00:44:01,329
yeah, I'm not I'm not actually about seed making right away.

816
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:02,829
I actually just want to learn.

817
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:05,797
And that's quite rare.

818
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:06,164
There is.

819
00:44:06,164 --> 00:44:10,064
There is one thing I'll add to this, and it's just the one thing from the past few

820
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:13,563
shows that I've noticed in the comments that nobody like maybe have.

821
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:16,397
Maybe I haven't communicated it well.

822
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:21,029
But the playing, when I refer to playing, which is crossing

823
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:24,063
unknown to unknown or to no.

824
00:44:24,063 --> 00:44:25,864
And and just seeing what happens.

825
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,730
Well, I say that's not breeding.

826
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,563
It is an a it is an essential part.

827
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:32,630
Yes. So learning to breed it is.

828
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,630
You can't really breed if you don't know what you have, like in my opinion.

829
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,329
And it is an essential step, but it's not breeding proper

830
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:44,630
because you're not doing necessarily having goals with selection.

831
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,697
You know, it's like not goal.

832
00:44:45,697 --> 00:44:47,663
There's not an end goal here.

833
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:49,597
We're just seeing what happens and learning.

834
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:50,930
But learning is a part of it.

835
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:51,929
You have to do that.

836
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:55,230
It's a major step, so I don't want to discount that part as part of breeding.

837
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,429
It's a major part of it, but it's not

838
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:01,396
breeding proper, if that makes any sense.

839
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:04,163
I think I can I can paraphrase that.

840
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:06,762
Would you do that?

841
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:09,762
The thing what shit sticks vibe

842
00:45:10,362 --> 00:45:14,929
is an important part of breeding, but breeding itself is not reducible to that.

843
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:16,262
Yes, exactly.

844
00:45:16,262 --> 00:45:18,096
Yeah, exactly.

845
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:20,330
And I want to make that clear because it sounds like

846
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,096
like I'd see people's comments saying, no, it's important.

847
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:25,330
I'm like, I never said it wasn't telling important.

848
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,529
I spent most of my career doing that.

849
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,530
You know, like, that's it's

850
00:45:30,663 --> 00:45:33,597
you know, and I can't sit on that.

851
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,230
Yeah, Yeah.

852
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,663
I think

853
00:45:36,663 --> 00:45:39,663
I think when people hear

854
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:43,462
someone putting conditions around something

855
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:47,463
like some people can be quick to assume that that means

856
00:45:47,463 --> 00:45:48,763
that they just shouldn't do it.

857
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:51,130
But that's not that's often not the case.

858
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,130
Often what we're just saying, always saying is we're

859
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,130
pointing out the limits of something.

860
00:45:57,163 --> 00:46:00,396
There is never just like something is outrightly good

861
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:03,563
or outrightly bad or outrightly useful or outrightly not useful.

862
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:04,063
Yeah.

863
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:09,262
Each each thing, each technique, each strategy has its own tradeoffs and limits.

864
00:46:10,297 --> 00:46:10,697
Yeah.

865
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:13,697
Each strategy is good for looking at those

866
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,097
types of phenotypes.

867
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,963
There you go.

868
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:19,863
Oh, we really need to get some.

869
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:20,962
Not so.

870
00:46:20,963 --> 00:46:23,697
Yeah, we do that stuff.

871
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,530
Yeah.

872
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,830
If any of you guys out there get bored, you hear this

873
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:30,596
and want to make little empathy clip, these are the best not so isms.

874
00:46:30,597 --> 00:46:33,597
I'll toss them up on the soundboard for sure.

875
00:46:34,097 --> 00:46:35,330
That's a really good idea.

876
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:38,096
Community, please get on it and help with that.

877
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:39,863
I posted some

878
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:42,762
if I had like another couple of hours, I might have tried to get some, but yeah.

879
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:44,462
Someone else. Please do it.

880
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:47,463
Yeah, there's a few I want to grab

881
00:46:47,996 --> 00:46:50,996
that.

882
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:53,130
We could also put his face on the screen.

883
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,663
Oh, we're playing those.

884
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:55,463
Oh, yeah.

885
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:58,463
I could just make a not so mask and wear it.

886
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:01,762
That's terrifying.

887
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:02,429
Yeah, it is.

888
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:05,862
Maybe for Halloween, I'll make him one for me and we'll play each other.

889
00:47:07,297 --> 00:47:09,362
We should do have a refresh. Just me.

890
00:47:09,362 --> 00:47:11,029
Yeah, we should.

891
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,697
That would be fun.

892
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:15,230
It'd make him do imitations of me and me.

893
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,329
Of him.

894
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:19,762
He has brutal, brutal imitations of me.

895
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:20,762
Too brutal.

896
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:21,429
I really.

897
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:25,329
I was actually going to say I didn't think not so it was like would would be

898
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:29,230
down is like the you know that he could do impersonations necessarily

899
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,463
I don't know why but that's cool to hear that he okay.

900
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:33,429
Yeah.

901
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:37,562
I'm not saying they're accurate, but it's more the things that he thinks.

902
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,563
I would say that,

903
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:43,597
Yeah, it's worth it.

904
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:44,297
All right.

905
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:44,762
All right.

906
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,529
Let's get back to the questions, shall we? Yeah.

907
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:49,797
Okay.

908
00:47:49,797 --> 00:47:52,862
We've got a pretty, pretty good and open one from Choisir.

909
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:55,563
He's actually got a couple, but we'll start with this one.

910
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,930
So he these are hypotheticals.

911
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:01,129
I don't know if he I assume that he's thinking about this,

912
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,130
but he's not actually started on anything yet.

913
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:05,130
He says.

914
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,497
So let's say he starts

915
00:48:06,496 --> 00:48:09,496
with a pack of them seats and he has a few possibilities here.

916
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:11,597
One is Cece's big bad wolf.

917
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,063
I think that is the deed.

918
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:17,063
And 91 is that, if I'm not mistaken,

919
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:21,862
there's a text once or he says one of the recent L.A.

920
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:24,629
Kush Headbands hybrids. Okay.

921
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,797
So starting with one of these, what steps would you take to get a male

922
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:31,996
with as many traits from the pack as possible?

923
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:33,829
And the

924
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:37,029
follow up being, would the starting femmes change the process?

925
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,030
And if so, how?

926
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:42,929
Yes. So they're all different

927
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:45,929
from each other, each step in that

928
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:48,197
they can be Cam 91

929
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:52,563
would definitely be different from eight k S1 selection

930
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:57,396
since they are variant X ones, its selection would definitely matter.

931
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:59,630
I mean, some are creamy, some are not like O.G.

932
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,963
Kush at all.

933
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:03,963
Some are very OG Kush type, you know.

934
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,730
And what was the last one?

935
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,996
It was one of the recent

936
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:12,062
Le Kush had banned crosses from not so seaside.

937
00:49:12,663 --> 00:49:13,063
Okay.

938
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:16,863
So mostly like diesel super skunk type hybrids were in there.

939
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,062
Most of them though.

940
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:21,329
Some are like bubblegum and bubble kush or Mando purpose that were very different.

941
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:24,329
So it really does depend on what the starting material is

942
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,762
before we can dive in of the males.

943
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:29,096
But let's assume, let's assume he's wanted to do

944
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:30,996
diesel type.

945
00:49:30,996 --> 00:49:32,762
Yeah.

946
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,429
Or actually now let's go Cam just because he went with chem

947
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:37,862
91, candy is the first one. Let's do that.

948
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:40,529
And he wants to go for chem

949
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,363
types. What?

950
00:49:41,362 --> 00:49:44,163
Where would he go for a male for that?

951
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:45,097
So, you know,

952
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:48,363
it just depends on the area you're from and the stuff you have access to.

953
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:52,230
Like I would immediately for any kind of regular chem

954
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,430
breeding hybrid, I would immediately

955
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:58,429
think of Natalie's to work with

956
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:03,596
like the chem 91 can be 95 in five.

957
00:50:04,262 --> 00:50:07,929
It was just so the heads entails above any other

958
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:11,395
regular chem work done by me, done by anyone else that I've ever seen.

959
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:15,096
It was just so precise to Chem 91 and I don't know how he did it.

960
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:18,330
It was just really lucky and good.

961
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:19,862
Not just lucky, but it was.

962
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,829
He knows Cam's really well and some of it was luck,

963
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,663
but it was good selection, you know what I mean?

964
00:50:24,663 --> 00:50:28,429
Like they had legend dog in their head start dog had Triangle

965
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:30,663
had all that stuff in 95.

966
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:33,896
And then you add in chem 91 and candy, which are two different plants.

967
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:38,430
Um, but knowing that and knowing that it's very chem

968
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:42,663
91 dominant, I would definitely advise quasi Qusay it'd

969
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:45,896
probably tracked something down similar to that

970
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:50,496
it's tracking down chem stuff takes knowing

971
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,963
really reliable sources of it and there's only a few people

972
00:50:54,963 --> 00:50:59,430
I trust on Earth with chem stuff to know what it is, to know that

973
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:03,695
they don't have fake cuts, to know that they never got fake cut it any of that.

974
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:07,596
There's only a few people that I trust for that, and I don't want to throw people

975
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:09,663
under the bus, so I'm not going to name all of them,

976
00:51:09,663 --> 00:51:11,295
but I really like metallic stuff to

977
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,630
nice, nice.

978
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,030
And I think that that work of his is pretty pervasive now.

979
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,030
You still see it used quite a bit, don't you?

980
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,130
Yeah, Some people have it.

981
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,396
We never sold it, ever.

982
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:27,796
You let people have it.

983
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:31,062
And if they were doing auctions for like charities or whatever,

984
00:51:31,063 --> 00:51:33,796
if they were selling these doing auctions, you would toss them in

985
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:37,663
and you gave me a bunch to like sell and toss toss in for freebies.

986
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:40,796
So they made it out there.

987
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:43,695
But like, not everybody picked him up.

988
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:46,663
So, no, I mean, people use them, but they're not as pervasive

989
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:47,530
as they once were.

990
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,296
I mean, I know Dynasty uses it, I use it.

991
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:51,895
And that's about it that I know of.

992
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,896
Right now.

993
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:54,163
Okay.

994
00:51:54,163 --> 00:51:57,163
Just for fun and for the sake of it, would you

995
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:00,163
would you be keen to then now move to like,

996
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:03,695
say he signed with the T ones and think what Matt would work for that.

997
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,430
So a lot of wedding cake stuff pops up in the case once.

998
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:10,562
When I say wedding cake type stuff, that means stuff that is like

999
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:13,896
kind of creamy matter to me

1000
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:17,296
and just very resinous, very productive, very dense.

1001
00:52:19,295 --> 00:52:20,329
You can find that

1002
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:23,329
in Let's see what's a good one.

1003
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:26,695
Boaties love triangle is a good example.

1004
00:52:27,096 --> 00:52:27,929
You can like that.

1005
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,329
That triangle ADHD 13 hash plant that a lot of people thought

1006
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:36,295
that the G 13 cash back was too dominant in it for a triangle

1007
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:39,295
Kush type, that cross would be a great one, I think,

1008
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,496
and keep that maybe hopefully help with the wedding.

1009
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:47,530
I don't know if it'll help with wedding cake terms, but but it might.

1010
00:52:48,563 --> 00:52:50,329
It might do.

1011
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:51,130
Well, you weren't joking

1012
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,130
when you said you could just do this off the top of your head.

1013
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:57,762
I did it for so long on Instagram every night for hours.

1014
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,796
You doing free consultations with people?

1015
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:03,929
Yes. Re always. Always for the piece.

1016
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:05,795
Okay.

1017
00:53:05,795 --> 00:53:06,129
All right.

1018
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,296
Well, how about now starting with the LA, let's assume

1019
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:12,295
it's going to be a diesel type cross.

1020
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,096
You know what? The saw a wrench in that.

1021
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:15,630
Let's do this.

1022
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:16,829
Not do a diesel type cross.

1023
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:19,829
Let's do

1024
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,096
what I Now you know what else Do a diesel type cross cause

1025
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:25,795
that's it's going to be slow in there because it wouldn't make sense.

1026
00:53:25,795 --> 00:53:29,362
I was going to say let's do like Mando perps or like bubblegum maybe,

1027
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:32,362
but I don't think that's going to necessarily dominate.

1028
00:53:32,396 --> 00:53:34,096
I think a lot of the bubblegum

1029
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:37,096
when it does, it's just earthy and not bubblegum smelling.

1030
00:53:37,396 --> 00:53:40,330
So diesel, let's do diesel.

1031
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:43,029
So again, diesel's a hard one

1032
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:46,330
because there are so few people I would trust to know diesels

1033
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,130
for regular diesel lines.

1034
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,496
God damn, that's hard. Yeah, that many.

1035
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:57,030
I don't know if I can think of them easily.

1036
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,463
I'm trying.

1037
00:53:57,463 --> 00:54:00,863
I'm trying to do stuff is not bluebonnet related or bluebonnet adjacent,

1038
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,163
and I'm trying to think of other people who make regular lines of diesel

1039
00:54:04,163 --> 00:54:07,396
that I would highly recommend that I know for

1040
00:54:07,396 --> 00:54:10,396
sure are using good diesels.

1041
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:11,963
I know Chuckles.

1042
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:14,563
Let some of his sour crosses out.

1043
00:54:14,563 --> 00:54:17,563
Those are great.

1044
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:22,730
I'm sure there's some.

1045
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,530
It just really takes a lot of research

1046
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,996
and I don't want to throw anyone under the bus.

1047
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,096
And then there's certain people I would recommend

1048
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:30,596
that just don't deserve it because they've been pricks lately.

1049
00:54:30,596 --> 00:54:33,295
So I'm kind of think, How about this? How about this map?

1050
00:54:33,295 --> 00:54:36,195
Make it a bit easier. What if you didn't have to find another?

1051
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:37,130
What if you couldn't?

1052
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:41,963
Let's just say you couldn't find a diesel male or diesel type kind of regular line.

1053
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,096
What other line would you go to if you could have?

1054
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:48,429
So I would recommend Super Skunk.

1055
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:51,262
So look for like a diesel regular seat hybrid.

1056
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:55,563
And now there are those out there from other people besides myself.

1057
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:58,862
And it's not too super rare to find just a void.

1058
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,395
Anyone with 420 in their username

1059
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:05,396
because usually those people will have fake diesel cats.

1060
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:07,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:10,563
So just to be clear, because Matt's being a bit

1062
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:16,195
specific, but he, Matt has a bunch of like regular diesel crosses, so.

1063
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:17,029
Yeah. Yeah.

1064
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,430
And other people do too.

1065
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:21,429
But yeah, there's definitely out there.

1066
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:21,963
Okay.

1067
00:55:21,963 --> 00:55:24,963
And it's an excellent super skunk type and sours a super scout

1068
00:55:25,063 --> 00:55:28,063
and diesel is more like

1069
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:32,495
more like diesel than it is like a cab, in my opinion.

1070
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,063
Yeah. Okay.

1071
00:55:35,063 --> 00:55:38,796
So within I guess within within this

1072
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:42,695
project, like in terms of steps, you know,

1073
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:46,195
are there any particular kinds of steps you would recommend him taking or,

1074
00:55:48,063 --> 00:55:51,163
you know, since it's all regular reading, I would really recommend

1075
00:55:51,996 --> 00:55:55,563
that crossing one time for the trait that he wants and then working it forward,

1076
00:55:56,528 --> 00:55:58,563
pick a trait, start with the trait.

1077
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,296
You know, pick a trait.

1078
00:56:00,295 --> 00:56:02,195
You can't have it all sometimes.

1079
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,295
I mean, I shouldn't say you can't have it all.

1080
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:06,528
Sometimes you get it all.

1081
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:08,128
Very rarely do you get it at all.

1082
00:56:08,128 --> 00:56:12,362
But sometimes it's in managing their expectations manager is

1083
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,329
because I mean, that did throw me a bit when he said,

1084
00:56:17,195 --> 00:56:17,795
What did he say?

1085
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:21,028
He said, with as many traits from the pack

1086
00:56:21,028 --> 00:56:24,063
as possible, like that's an interesting qualifier for me where I'm.

1087
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,528
Yeah, that's interesting.

1088
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:26,929
Yeah. Yeah.

1089
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:30,163
I mean sometimes you get good reading

1090
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:33,262
work done in the pack that you received, right?

1091
00:56:33,262 --> 00:56:34,795
Like the blue bonnet was ready to go.

1092
00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:38,563
CCI does great work,

1093
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:41,563
so sometimes you'll get,

1094
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:44,228
you know, it'll be that easy.

1095
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:46,795
Lots of times it's pick a trait

1096
00:56:46,795 --> 00:56:50,062
and stick with one because that's, that's the best you could hope for.

1097
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:54,195
But yeah but yeah it happens.

1098
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:55,562
Yeah.

1099
00:56:55,563 --> 00:56:59,429
So I think there's a difference between something unlikely occurring

1100
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:03,996
and you planning your process relative to what is likely to happen

1101
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,262
and you are planning your process likely

1102
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:09,795
to what is planning your process relative to what is likely,

1103
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:13,929
then you should try to focus on like a single trait

1104
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:18,795
at each step because you're reducing the odds.

1105
00:57:18,795 --> 00:57:21,562
I mean, sorry, you're helping your odds.

1106
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,195
I think I was trying to make a point of that last week.

1107
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:26,795
I had a really, really skewed understanding

1108
00:57:26,795 --> 00:57:30,428
of breeding, how it worked, how traits work, what a phenotype was.

1109
00:57:30,429 --> 00:57:31,396
All that coming up.

1110
00:57:31,396 --> 00:57:34,196
I didn't have anybody to teach me specifics on that.

1111
00:57:34,195 --> 00:57:35,496
I didn't really like.

1112
00:57:35,496 --> 00:57:36,762
I didn't go to college for this.

1113
00:57:36,762 --> 00:57:38,728
I didn't pay attention in high school to botany.

1114
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:40,962
I just didn't care about any of that shit, right?

1115
00:57:40,963 --> 00:57:47,528
So I had to learn as it went and it just none of stuff comes common sense.

1116
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:50,496
And that's the one thing we've been trying to drive home is like

1117
00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:53,063
Murphy's Law

1118
00:57:53,063 --> 00:57:57,063
plays out heavy sometimes, you know, expect the worst to happen.

1119
00:57:57,063 --> 00:58:00,996
And like, I ran into a lot of Murphy's Law on my way up.

1120
00:58:01,295 --> 00:58:03,495
That doesn't mean everybody does, but I did.

1121
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:06,496
So that's why I always, like, have these qualifiers.

1122
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:09,295
Like, you know, this is that I try to give the worst case scenario

1123
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:12,928
what to expect because sometimes that's just how it plays out.

1124
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:17,096
I mean, I felt like in some ways and I know I'm

1125
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:20,762
being uncharitable about our content, but in some ways I saw last week's

1126
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:23,762
episode as just an extended fucking disclaimer.

1127
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:26,528
You know, in a way,

1128
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:29,528
if you don't think that's inaccurate, Yeah, because

1129
00:58:30,228 --> 00:58:33,096
some of this kind of thinking is not intuitive as you're saying.

1130
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:36,628
Like people are becoming accustomed to how you deal

1131
00:58:36,628 --> 00:58:40,496
with probabilistic outcomes that may not be intuitive

1132
00:58:42,262 --> 00:58:45,596
using terms like low flow, high ceiling.

1133
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:46,496
Those are

1134
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:51,163
terms that you use around probability and how you think about probability.

1135
00:58:51,496 --> 00:58:53,096
That's a good point.

1136
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:56,128
And when you are dealing with probability, probability,

1137
00:58:56,596 --> 00:58:59,496
it's not enough to just say, well, it can happen.

1138
00:58:59,496 --> 00:59:02,796
It's like, yes, any of these outcomes are possible,

1139
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:05,663
but it doesn't mean that they are probable.

1140
00:59:05,663 --> 00:59:09,295
So just because it happened for you once doesn't mean that it's repeatable

1141
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:10,762
and that it can be consistent.

1142
00:59:10,762 --> 00:59:13,762
You might just have been extremely, extremely lucky.

1143
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:18,762
Like in the chat yesterday in Discord and in the Voice Chat, people were talking

1144
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:22,563
about their positive experiences with Pauline chuckling

1145
00:59:23,795 --> 00:59:27,096
like in the open, like hitting Rand,

1146
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:30,096
not hitting random branches and you know, like, Hey, I could do this.

1147
00:59:30,096 --> 00:59:31,295
It's nothing big.

1148
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:34,596
I did it, you know, it's like just because you were able to do it in the tent

1149
00:59:34,829 --> 00:59:35,596
with your,

1150
00:59:35,596 --> 00:59:39,628
you know, that one time doesn't mean that you should like, make that a habit,

1151
00:59:40,795 --> 00:59:42,762
because I promise it won't happen that way every time.

1152
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:46,096
Yeah, I mean that you and I were chatting a bit about gaming,

1153
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:49,128
which I don't think we've ever done before, before we started recording,

1154
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:53,795
and it kind of comes to mind for me in the in the world of games as well,

1155
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:59,395
where you might make a ridiculous move that works for you that one time.

1156
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,096
But if you do it 100 times, it might work like

1157
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:05,195
three or four times or,

1158
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:07,828
you know, something, some kind of terrible success rate.

1159
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:11,863
And there's a difference between something being reliable and repeatable

1160
01:00:12,128 --> 01:00:15,395
and something that just works for you just because it works for you that one time.

1161
01:00:15,896 --> 01:00:18,663
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

1162
01:00:18,663 --> 01:00:22,028
That's a that's actually a really good way of saying it and illustrating

1163
01:00:23,728 --> 01:00:24,163
you know, like

1164
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:27,295
sometimes I play games and that's like playing with actual kids

1165
01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:30,328
and they annoy the shit out of me and, and they do something stupid.

1166
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:31,863
And I'm like, You shouldn't have done that.

1167
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:32,195
But they like.

1168
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,462
But it worked right?

1169
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:37,263
And like, yeah, but you know, and then give up

1170
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,429
and then they walk outside and get hit by a car

1171
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:42,429
and then they telling me to go touch grass or whatever.

1172
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:43,695
And I'm like, Yeah, I'm old. I know.

1173
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:46,929
Oh my God, you deal with How do you deal with that?

1174
01:00:46,963 --> 01:00:49,963
Of course I've got so much.

1175
01:00:50,096 --> 01:00:52,862
I just have to be like, You don't have a full brain.

1176
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,628
I'm going to just forget about what you just said.

1177
01:00:55,628 --> 01:00:57,996
Just. Yeah. You? Yeah.

1178
01:00:57,996 --> 01:00:59,262
Okay.

1179
01:00:59,262 --> 01:00:59,895
Okay.

1180
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:02,429
So we can come back to Quasi.

1181
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:04,463
Is second question, which is also quite interesting.

1182
01:01:06,528 --> 01:01:09,096
So his hypothetical scenario

1183
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:12,496
is finding a client that has some really unique sense.

1184
01:01:13,061 --> 01:01:14,061
I think he specified like,

1185
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:17,061
you know, low concentration, high impact scent compounds.

1186
01:01:17,496 --> 01:01:21,862
But essentially he's saying he's found if you find something with a unique scent,

1187
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:25,695
that he's I don't know if he's guessing is a recessive trait

1188
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:30,761
or if he's maybe discovered that it's recessive or has a premonition that it is,

1189
01:01:31,728 --> 01:01:34,561
but that that scent is otherwise getting lost

1190
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:38,328
in the overall like nose of the of the plot.

1191
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:39,296
Right.

1192
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,195
And also, it doesn't translate to flavor.

1193
01:01:42,195 --> 01:01:45,895
How would he go about breeding to make that rare scent component

1194
01:01:45,896 --> 01:01:50,162
more prominent in the overall nose and translate that into flavor?

1195
01:01:51,496 --> 01:01:53,796
He says it's fine to bring in other specific flavors

1196
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:55,561
as long as the overall package is high.

1197
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:59,528
Flavor and that the original recessive sent component,

1198
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:01,161
the one that he was talking about at the beginning

1199
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:04,195
comes through.

1200
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:07,195
Ultimately, it seems like

1201
01:02:08,096 --> 01:02:10,862
I think nailing both of those things seems really hard.

1202
01:02:10,862 --> 01:02:14,829
Maybe even just talking about how you try to get that one draw that one

1203
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:18,396
since out is maybe enough for one part of this question.

1204
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:21,728
So like for me, when he says

1205
01:02:21,728 --> 01:02:24,728
like a high impact, low

1206
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:28,928
occurrence or whatever, I like low concentration concentration.

1207
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:32,096
So like something like a volatile sulfur compound or something that

1208
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:35,028
dissipates pretty fast, I would assume this.

1209
01:02:35,028 --> 01:02:37,329
What would you say? Road kill?

1210
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:38,461
Yeah. Yes.

1211
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:40,896
No, no, never.

1212
01:02:40,896 --> 01:02:43,896
No, I think that's what he's referring to.

1213
01:02:44,596 --> 01:02:46,396
And it's probably the example I'll go to

1214
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:49,396
on how I tried to do it a few different ways.

1215
01:02:49,596 --> 01:02:51,896
We had two, what I think were

1216
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:56,829
superstock adjacent lines in like diesel and then the elm Afghani,

1217
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:00,629
which had a lot of typically more sativa expressions, but

1218
01:03:01,596 --> 01:03:03,661
it is mostly Afghani

1219
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:07,428
in structure and that's what we were told it was, and it played out that way.

1220
01:03:07,429 --> 01:03:10,695
But what most people like, it was more narrow leaf in some expressions.

1221
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:13,661
So I think people would typically classify that is achievable.

1222
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:17,328
I don't see it as that, but I do think it has super scope in it

1223
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:20,329
or something like that or a similar type of Afghani.

1224
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:26,429
So I tried doing s once of the Afghan

1225
01:03:27,461 --> 01:03:31,295
and it had a very, very high volatile sulfur compound.

1226
01:03:32,596 --> 01:03:34,596
Like you could just smell it like

1227
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:39,096
it was just wild, wild, strong in that out cross is what we saw

1228
01:03:39,096 --> 01:03:42,929
or not I'm sorry, in the self line, what we saw was a lot of variation.

1229
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:45,395
We saw a lot of variation in

1230
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:49,896
expression being that it was it would go from because when you would

1231
01:03:49,896 --> 01:03:54,129
smell it, the the combination of all the smells smelled kind of skunky.

1232
01:03:54,128 --> 01:03:57,695
But like individually it would be a combination of like

1233
01:03:57,996 --> 01:04:01,961
ammonia piss, you know, rubber tennis ball.

1234
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:02,628
Yeah.

1235
01:04:02,628 --> 01:04:06,528
And then whatever that component is in diesel

1236
01:04:06,528 --> 01:04:10,829
that is skunky, whatever that component is that that you would describe as that

1237
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:13,996
in super skunk and Jesus in that kind of type

1238
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:16,996
or sour even,

1239
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:19,895
it had that in those three combinations together.

1240
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:24,429
It just smells loud, like loud, like burn your eyes, skunk.

1241
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:28,761
But we saw like each of those individual expressions laid out.

1242
01:04:28,762 --> 01:04:34,129
We see stuff that was just we'd see stuff that was just burnt rubber,

1243
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:37,762
which is stuff that was more like savory skunk.

1244
01:04:37,996 --> 01:04:40,996
But it's really hard to nail the trifecta

1245
01:04:41,195 --> 01:04:44,195
of all three in a in a very potent form.

1246
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:45,996
Like the initial mob was super hard.

1247
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:50,128
So I tried that way and at the same time, at another location,

1248
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:53,528
we were doing a diesel cross to a

1249
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:56,628
or I'm sorry, Sour Dub crossover versus diesel.

1250
01:04:56,829 --> 01:05:00,096
And in doing this I was testing the Super Skunk,

1251
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:03,429
the theory that like if we double up on the super stomping that sour dub

1252
01:05:03,429 --> 01:05:06,429
has superstock in it by the shower and

1253
01:05:08,496 --> 01:05:10,929
so the diesel and then diesel has super stuck in it

1254
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:15,061
probably being a super skunk stuff like accidental Bag seed.

1255
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:20,496
And what I found was that more consistently the skunk spray can seem to

1256
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:24,161
and that was the name of the like direct it towards

1257
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:29,561
the sound of diesel seemed to go more towards keeping it consistently

1258
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:33,895
in that super skunk, savory, buttery skunk range

1259
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:37,161
and not veering away from it.

1260
01:05:37,161 --> 01:05:40,295
Whereas the heirloom Afghani one would go the pissy

1261
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:43,295
range and more of the tennis ball range, if that makes sense.

1262
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:47,796
So that's how I did it in approaching that

1263
01:05:48,762 --> 01:05:51,296
project in a similar method.

1264
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:54,628
Now moving terps into it is really hard.

1265
01:05:54,628 --> 01:05:57,929
Initially, like when I think of bringing in any kind of terps to things

1266
01:05:57,929 --> 01:06:03,096
like extracts, I immediately think it's really because like that journaling to me

1267
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:07,128
is turned up the volume on most fruity flavors, berry flavor, stuff like that.

1268
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:10,229
I don't know that you're penalizing too friendly would

1269
01:06:10,228 --> 01:06:13,328
necessarily be a great driver of smoky stuff, but

1270
01:06:13,528 --> 01:06:16,496
it definitely helped in the Fairfax four way.

1271
01:06:16,496 --> 01:06:19,961
So there's no reason that it couldn't help with this

1272
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:24,162
and actually translate it to even more flavor.

1273
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,328
But appearance known to dominate so heavy.

1274
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:28,262
So you'd get a lot of stuff

1275
01:06:28,262 --> 01:06:31,629
that was only paneling with no volatile organic compounds or sulfur compound

1276
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:35,096
and it would take a large pop

1277
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:38,461
or a lot of luck to find, but that would be my first thought.

1278
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,594
Yeah, very nice.

1279
01:06:41,594 --> 01:06:44,594
And I think from a theoretical point of view, like

1280
01:06:45,061 --> 01:06:48,061
like you were saying, it obviously depends a lot on whether or not

1281
01:06:48,894 --> 01:06:51,894
in reality this is actually trying to combine

1282
01:06:53,195 --> 01:06:56,162
a few different traits

1283
01:06:56,161 --> 01:06:59,194
or if it you know, from, say, like a Mendelian perspective,

1284
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:02,195
it literally is a single trait that's recessive.

1285
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,461
Then technically, again, from a theoretical point of view,

1286
01:07:05,461 --> 01:07:08,929
if it's a single trait that is recessive, you need to find out the plant

1287
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:12,095
that also has that trait, that is also recessive.

1288
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,295
That's the only way you'll see much of the double recessive.

1289
01:07:15,628 --> 01:07:17,194
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1290
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:18,562
So this is something that like

1291
01:07:18,561 --> 01:07:21,628
I think Matt did a better explanation of actually practically

1292
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:24,661
how you would try to approach it and that's and but by doing it

1293
01:07:24,661 --> 01:07:28,661
and everything we've done and also Caleb with the big bad wolf and other

1294
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,494
other, these cam and super skunk

1295
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:34,494
hybrids, we're kind of figuring out yeah it seems like that

1296
01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:39,995
that that that smell in the super skunk lines seems to be a double recessive.

1297
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:41,295
It seems to be recessive.

1298
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:42,128
And when you

1299
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:45,328
when you do the super what we call the super stunt double up, technically it

1300
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,795
it seems like it is a double recessive and locking it in.

1301
01:07:48,795 --> 01:07:51,795
And that's why when you do it it consistently shows

1302
01:07:53,128 --> 01:07:54,628
cool. Very nice.

1303
01:07:54,628 --> 01:07:57,728
I think that one will be very interesting to a lot of people.

1304
01:08:00,094 --> 01:08:03,128
So I actually had a last minute addition.

1305
01:08:03,394 --> 01:08:05,661
I don't think I got to go over this one with you,

1306
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:08,661
but I think it's I think it's pretty reasonable.

1307
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:11,195
So it's from dude, this

1308
01:08:11,195 --> 01:08:15,495
he's got a male sour diesel, unknown provenance, so sour diesel, quote unquote.

1309
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:19,594
He describes it as being

1310
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:23,195
well-structured, sturdy, vigorous, good, gassy stem.

1311
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:27,528
Rip, I'm assuming that he doesn't actually know he's

1312
01:08:27,662 --> 01:08:32,095
he's not run progeny out from it before, so just qualify that as a flower.

1313
01:08:32,128 --> 01:08:35,128
Also he's doing stem rubs

1314
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,161
doesn't specify.

1315
01:08:36,162 --> 01:08:39,329
So maybe we can make some assumptions like we're going to assume No.

1316
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:40,662
Okay.

1317
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:43,595
So if you're doing stem rubs, you don't get into the flower.

1318
01:08:43,595 --> 01:08:44,262
Yeah.

1319
01:08:44,261 --> 01:08:46,728
Yeah, you're probably right.

1320
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:49,729
So he's also got two female keepers of limelight

1321
01:08:50,962 --> 01:08:53,962
that is key Lime pie

1322
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:55,694
by MBB.

1323
01:08:55,694 --> 01:08:58,694
Okay, so I'm not as familiar with this one.

1324
01:09:00,862 --> 01:09:04,462
He says that they don't have the greatest frame, but they grow well.

1325
01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:07,462
They smell good pine, skunk, hint of lime.

1326
01:09:07,628 --> 01:09:09,961
And ultimately what he's trying to achieve,

1327
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:12,729
he wants to put a studio frame on the limelight

1328
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:15,695
and maybe add a bit more gas to the back end.

1329
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:18,694
Maybe maintaining or increasing potency.

1330
01:09:18,862 --> 01:09:21,395
He's made the first cross already.

1331
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:22,762
Okay, so I was mistaken.

1332
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:24,094
He hasn't made a cross

1333
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,029
and he's about to run through the first generation

1334
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:27,762
to dig through to see what's being passed.

1335
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:32,195
The question he's got,

1336
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:35,228
if I find a male or female keeper in the F1 pop,

1337
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:39,061
should I go to F2 as well

1338
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:41,362
or should I just try?

1339
01:09:41,362 --> 01:09:44,362
Or what would be the best course to try and lock in those like

1340
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:48,761
traits that he wants in the cross?

1341
01:09:49,694 --> 01:09:52,761
So structure is one of the easiest things to breed for

1342
01:09:53,828 --> 01:09:54,328
true.

1343
01:09:54,328 --> 01:09:58,194
I mean point because I mean hemp is very it has great structure and that's

1344
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:00,595
I cannabis and it's

1345
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:03,595
really earned its state its natural state to him

1346
01:10:04,029 --> 01:10:07,029
so that's true yeah

1347
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:10,895
so and when he says it's sour diesel with great structure I immediately think

1348
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:14,795
sour so because that's not and I think he's kind of aware of that.

1349
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:17,328
I think he's saying that like, you know, that's what he's calling it.

1350
01:10:17,328 --> 01:10:20,728
But you know it's yeah, I'm in that and that's typical though

1351
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:23,795
that's not even a crack on it because that's that happens a lot.

1352
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:25,128
It's a male. How are you going? It does,

1353
01:10:26,328 --> 01:10:26,528
yeah.

1354
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:30,595
So I guess maybe his male that he wasn't able to get much more than STEM

1355
01:10:30,595 --> 01:10:33,595
reps off of the smell, which also can happen with males

1356
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:37,662
if he's run through the progeny and he sees what he likes

1357
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:40,595
he'll S1 it.

1358
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:42,395
There's no reason to have to wait

1359
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:45,395
if you've already got everything you like with this structure in the progeny,

1360
01:10:46,462 --> 01:10:47,795
unless you think it's not quite

1361
01:10:47,795 --> 01:10:50,862
good enough and it's not keeper enough for your case.

1362
01:10:50,862 --> 01:10:51,694
Like if you think there's nothing

1363
01:10:51,694 --> 01:10:54,694
better in there, then of course you can do it. But

1364
01:10:54,795 --> 01:10:57,395
again, so I think what this like to do.

1365
01:10:57,395 --> 01:10:59,162
Oh, good, good.

1366
01:10:59,162 --> 01:11:02,162
I was going to say that his extended question was basically like,

1367
01:11:02,895 --> 01:11:04,429
I thought you may have already answered it.

1368
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:08,229
He's basically saying, yeah, how far down the generations should I go

1369
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:11,362
and should I, like, consider back crossing as well kind of thing.

1370
01:11:12,462 --> 01:11:13,829
I mean,

1371
01:11:13,828 --> 01:11:16,828
like I say, people have this want to like

1372
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:19,762
work a line or think that they need to work a line,

1373
01:11:19,761 --> 01:11:22,295
but it's if you've already found what you like,

1374
01:11:22,295 --> 01:11:25,694
there's really nothing else to do but S1 one unless you really want a regular seed

1375
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:27,061
line of it.

1376
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:29,561
I think that's a huge point.

1377
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:32,229
Yeah, you don't have to keep working it.

1378
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:34,862
You don't have to you don't need to keep looking.

1379
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:38,494
If you found like your ultimate keeper that you like, like it nails all the boxes

1380
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:42,695
and then you can always, I guess, explore, look through the rest and be sure

1381
01:11:43,128 --> 01:11:45,994
maybe there is something way that you didn't even know existed.

1382
01:11:45,994 --> 01:11:49,694
But ultimately, when you find that one that is a keeper,

1383
01:11:50,662 --> 01:11:51,895
unless your goal is to have

1384
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:54,895
like just a bunch of regular sheets backed up for it,

1385
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:58,061
then I just don't know any reason

1386
01:11:58,061 --> 01:12:01,061
to do anything other than S1 or self it.

1387
01:12:01,462 --> 01:12:04,862
So a paraphrase of this is work forward.

1388
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,862
If you are looking for more. Yes,

1389
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:11,694
but if you have what you are looking for, then

1390
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:15,428
it is less less reasonable to do that.

1391
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:18,427
Yeah, it's just age y y.

1392
01:12:18,494 --> 01:12:20,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1393
01:12:20,494 --> 01:12:21,761
From a learning point of view maybe.

1394
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:24,094
But otherwise, yeah. Why?

1395
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:29,095
It's like when I see books six or 12 or F 12.

1396
01:12:29,427 --> 01:12:31,595
Like if you're doing real selections on this stuff,

1397
01:12:31,595 --> 01:12:33,462
you should be able to lock it in and foremost,

1398
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:36,562
like at least the trait that you want are multiple traits.

1399
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:40,927
If, if the Yeah people do it pro people say crazy shit.

1400
01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:44,927
Do people be making seeds for two years and say they're F12

1401
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,061
and you just look at them like, what

1402
01:12:48,095 --> 01:12:49,628
now I do.

1403
01:12:49,627 --> 01:12:53,427
I was watching I was watching a BBC documentary

1404
01:12:53,427 --> 01:12:55,627
on the history Apples in Britain.

1405
01:12:55,627 --> 01:12:59,494
Yeah, I'll say, first of all, it's the fucking most British thing I've ever seen.

1406
01:12:59,662 --> 01:13:02,195
Like, it sounds like it, dude.

1407
01:13:02,194 --> 01:13:03,094
It was.

1408
01:13:03,095 --> 01:13:06,828
It was actually really cold and they were talking about

1409
01:13:07,162 --> 01:13:09,962
what it actually took to develop some of the new varieties.

1410
01:13:09,962 --> 01:13:12,962
And it was they literally were taking like a decade.

1411
01:13:13,528 --> 01:13:14,128
Yeah.

1412
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:18,094
Because sometimes they're doing, they're waiting for sport mutations,

1413
01:13:18,095 --> 01:13:22,061
which is like a clonal mutation on a branch to pop up like that's

1414
01:13:22,595 --> 01:13:26,295
that, that's just waiting out luck and nature

1415
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:29,895
to take its course and time Like it doesn't.

1416
01:13:30,561 --> 01:13:33,694
It's a random occurrence, you know, like my favorite apples

1417
01:13:34,095 --> 01:13:38,628
are they call them Cosmic crunch I think they're called and they're a

1418
01:13:39,694 --> 01:13:42,161
cosmic crisp, cosmic, crisp apples.

1419
01:13:42,162 --> 01:13:46,528
And they are a sport mutation off of the Honeycrisp apple.

1420
01:13:46,528 --> 01:13:47,695
And when I first got them, I was like, Fuck,

1421
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:49,894
I'll just get the seeds out, what the hell?

1422
01:13:49,895 --> 01:13:51,995
And then I was like, thinking about it like, Wait a minute,

1423
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,862
I know that that's not quite how it works in apples.

1424
01:13:54,862 --> 01:13:56,162
It's not fantasy.

1425
01:13:56,162 --> 01:13:57,095
Do you know what I mean?

1426
01:13:57,095 --> 01:13:59,462
So I looked it up and then, Yeah, absolutely.

1427
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:04,028
If you pop those seeds, you may get nothing close.

1428
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:04,494
Yeah. Yeah.

1429
01:14:04,494 --> 01:14:07,028
It's a sport mutation, so it's not going to occur at all.

1430
01:14:07,028 --> 01:14:09,028
Like normally.

1431
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:09,228
Yeah.

1432
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:12,994
They still rely very much on unconscious grafting.

1433
01:14:13,627 --> 01:14:13,827
Yeah.

1434
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:17,228
And the actually, I'll say this, I think it was it kind of blew my mind.

1435
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:20,228
This is the one part that I wasn't expecting at all.

1436
01:14:20,494 --> 01:14:25,662
They breed root stocks like, Oh yeah, they will, they will have

1437
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:28,895
separate kinds of root stalks and then grass things onto them.

1438
01:14:29,194 --> 01:14:30,161
And I just didn't

1439
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:33,494
somehow, I mean, I knew this was the thing I know, especially in citrus,

1440
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:37,862
it's a thing, but I was just kind of blown away by the idea that like

1441
01:14:38,528 --> 01:14:41,962
they basically have like a cloned rootstock that they will use.

1442
01:14:42,194 --> 01:14:44,494
So that brings the consistency.

1443
01:14:44,494 --> 01:14:48,961
I actually wonder what that would mean in cannabis because I know guys, we do it.

1444
01:14:49,427 --> 01:14:51,061
People do it. We do?

1445
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:52,061
Oh yeah, Yeah.

1446
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:54,561
Like O.G. coaches have really, really weak root structure.

1447
01:14:54,561 --> 01:14:55,295
Who is doing this?

1448
01:14:55,295 --> 01:14:55,694
The other day

1449
01:14:55,694 --> 01:14:58,827
I was talking to someone I was talking to who is doing this the other day.

1450
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,761
Oh, I know exactly what Farmer did, but he's been working on it

1451
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:03,828
with some of their stock.

1452
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:07,395
And yeah, dogs have really weak root structures and they're known for it.

1453
01:15:07,694 --> 01:15:10,394
If you graft that on to something like a ball, but it has like

1454
01:15:10,395 --> 01:15:14,395
really bad root structure like any, any plant bubblegum,

1455
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,894
a fucking hemp cut, you know what I mean.

1456
01:15:17,895 --> 01:15:19,295
After that is that you're, you're

1457
01:15:20,328 --> 01:15:23,162
solid bro, you can pound it out with somebody.

1458
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:24,662
So yeah

1459
01:15:24,662 --> 01:15:27,962
it reminded me of another like quite one of those like

1460
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:32,161
what about one of those weird, like peripheral projects

1461
01:15:32,162 --> 01:15:35,228
that you get to see on the forums where it was like,

1462
01:15:36,127 --> 01:15:40,127
basically like rootstock with multiple grafts from multiple different

1463
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:43,127
individuals, like onto the one mother,

1464
01:15:43,362 --> 01:15:46,462
kind of like weird hydra type plant.

1465
01:15:46,862 --> 01:15:50,395
They always have those emerald cut bro, like the blue Dream with O.G.

1466
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:53,728
on it and like fucking like nine other clones grafted onto it.

1467
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:55,627
It's like a bizarre novelty plant.

1468
01:15:55,627 --> 01:15:58,261
So I guess like

1469
01:15:58,261 --> 01:15:58,394
kind.

1470
01:15:58,395 --> 01:16:01,362
Nicole I guess I wanted to buy an Apple one yesterday.

1471
01:16:01,362 --> 01:16:01,895
They have a three

1472
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:05,495
in one apple plant that their tree that they're selling at Home Depot

1473
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:08,462
that I think I like. I assume it was grafted.

1474
01:16:08,462 --> 01:16:10,862
I don't know how are they also they doing three in one.

1475
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:12,328
No it must be Yeah.

1476
01:16:12,328 --> 01:16:16,195
Apple trees but yeah like but it was funny because like I'd see some of them

1477
01:16:16,194 --> 01:16:16,994
that would like

1478
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:19,827
it looks smaller than the others and not just branches and they would

1479
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:22,262
they would be advertised as three in one but there would only be two.

1480
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:25,295
Tag showed it like so one of the branches got knocked off.

1481
01:16:25,295 --> 01:16:27,395
That was a whole other graph too.

1482
01:16:27,395 --> 01:16:29,562
And I, but they still wanted the same price.

1483
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:31,795
Obviously it's Home Depot.

1484
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:34,228
I guess they're going back to the kind of

1485
01:16:35,194 --> 01:16:36,927
Hydra Hydra

1486
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:41,362
like multi multi branch, multi individual graft thing.

1487
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:44,395
I guess if you're like

1488
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:47,695
you live in a prohibition country like me under prohibition conditions

1489
01:16:47,694 --> 01:16:51,627
and like maybe it would be a very ambitious kind of mother project

1490
01:16:51,627 --> 01:16:52,795
where you technically

1491
01:16:52,795 --> 01:16:56,328
would be have one mother plant, but it's actually many plants.

1492
01:16:56,627 --> 01:16:58,728
Absolutely. Absolutely.

1493
01:16:58,728 --> 01:17:03,362
I mean, that's that's, that's a that's the solution to a lot of people's problems.

1494
01:17:03,362 --> 01:17:04,895
I think

1495
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,095
you can't keep as many mothers keep a monster.

1496
01:17:08,095 --> 01:17:11,128
Mom, Hydra, mom, Monster mom. All right.

1497
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:13,427
Anyone in the discord who's clean, please do it.

1498
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:14,461
I want to see it.

1499
01:17:14,462 --> 01:17:17,795
And you know my friend Racer X, who

1500
01:17:18,694 --> 01:17:21,694
used to be one of my like, is he still around?

1501
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:24,694
Like, he was really integral in our company early on.

1502
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,895
Um, he would do amazing, like,

1503
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:30,827
draft brand breath

1504
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:35,195
grafting, like monster branches, like tree grafting branches.

1505
01:17:35,895 --> 01:17:39,328
And he would do like monster clones, like six foot clones

1506
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:40,362
just to see if he could do it.

1507
01:17:40,362 --> 01:17:44,228
Like air pruning, which is where you moisten part of the branch

1508
01:17:44,228 --> 01:17:48,295
and like cracks, bits of roots come out and they would like try to grow

1509
01:17:48,295 --> 01:17:51,728
into the soil on its own, like he'd have these air conditioner that

1510
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:55,061
he had great pictures of doing all this stuff in the day,

1511
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,594
but I haven't seen it done in a while.

1512
01:17:58,627 --> 01:18:00,960
I mean, I think I guess the broad

1513
01:18:00,961 --> 01:18:02,828
I mean, I know this was just like a fun tangent,

1514
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:05,828
but I guess a broad a broad learning from this for me

1515
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:10,895
is like, don't hesitate to look outside of cannabis

1516
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:14,728
for examples of information for inspiration.

1517
01:18:15,228 --> 01:18:17,927
Because like I pointed out last week,

1518
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:21,595
the information space in cannabis is basically like ruined.

1519
01:18:22,228 --> 01:18:26,461
And if you I mean, apart from us, of course we're perfect.

1520
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:28,961
But Yeah.

1521
01:18:28,961 --> 01:18:31,427
But otherwise, if you want to learn about breeding,

1522
01:18:31,427 --> 01:18:33,661
definitely like look at other crops, like,

1523
01:18:33,661 --> 01:18:36,694
you know, human civilization has thousands of years of history of breeding.

1524
01:18:36,694 --> 01:18:41,194
So There's no reason why we can't learn from other types of agriculture.

1525
01:18:41,828 --> 01:18:42,961
Absolutely.

1526
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:47,961
And but one thing I've also learned is that, like in scientific data,

1527
01:18:48,627 --> 01:18:53,027
specifically when they are trying to apply, say, hops

1528
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:59,060
or hemp to drug type cannabis, they often do that and don't qualify that.

1529
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,260
Or people don't understand that it really is qualified as another

1530
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:05,795
type of this plant. And the

1531
01:19:06,828 --> 01:19:09,461
I mean, it can work backwards to where

1532
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:13,761
like you over qualify it with cannabis where it doesn't necessarily apply,

1533
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:17,494
but you should always look outside of cannabis always.

1534
01:19:17,494 --> 01:19:20,494
There's so many outside of the box things that you can bring from

1535
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:23,360
other agriculture into cannabis that will apply.

1536
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,360
But do remember, not everything always applies.

1537
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,028
Yes, yes, yes.

1538
01:19:28,028 --> 01:19:29,461
This would be a speculative thing.

1539
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:32,628
Not like you can definitely just bring in anything wholesale

1540
01:19:32,627 --> 01:19:34,728
and assume it's the same. Yeah, definitely.

1541
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:37,728
I was reading a paper the other day and this is something that I experienced

1542
01:19:37,728 --> 01:19:40,728
myself in reversing like large populations of hemp,

1543
01:19:41,494 --> 01:19:43,760
but they found that hemp reversed

1544
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:46,861
relatively well compared to drug type cannabis consistently.

1545
01:19:47,261 --> 01:19:52,595
So even though they are the same land because one has elevated THC drug levels

1546
01:19:52,595 --> 01:19:57,795
for whatever reason, it is much harder to reverse than like the CBD they plant.

1547
01:19:58,028 --> 01:19:59,494
Fascinating. Yeah.

1548
01:20:01,461 --> 01:20:02,695
Okay.

1549
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:03,094
Okay.

1550
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:04,828
Well, coming back, I think this is the

1551
01:20:04,828 --> 01:20:08,561
this is actually a follow up to dude's question, and it's probably

1552
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,560
the last question we'll get to for today.

1553
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:12,494
Okay.

1554
01:20:12,494 --> 01:20:15,528
In terms of breeding scenarios, we have a couple of like miscellaneous

1555
01:20:15,528 --> 01:20:18,095
breeding questions we'll also answer at the end. Okay.

1556
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:19,895
So dude, nice.

1557
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:25,228
His follow up, I'd like to try to reverse the Saudi's male quote, the quote

1558
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:30,095
unquote Saudi's on male to possibly get a nice female individual to pair with

1559
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:32,127
one self.

1560
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,194
How many crosses or the progeny would be ideal to get a decent

1561
01:20:35,194 --> 01:20:38,194
look into them?

1562
01:20:42,595 --> 01:20:45,728
Well, first of all, like what is the benefit of reversing the Saudis?

1563
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:48,961
Well, like, I don't know much about this, so maybe you can speak to that.

1564
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:52,028
So in reversing males, you use a different chemical

1565
01:20:52,028 --> 01:20:55,095
than you would for reversing females, because we're not blocking ethylene.

1566
01:20:55,095 --> 01:20:58,427
We're trying to get it to, you know, have a lot of in it.

1567
01:21:01,028 --> 01:21:01,427
When you

1568
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:04,427
reverse a male, just like when you reverse a female,

1569
01:21:04,494 --> 01:21:08,595
you don't just get a perfect male version of a female.

1570
01:21:08,728 --> 01:21:13,295
You get a male part on a female budge structure, vice versa

1571
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:17,360
on a male, you get female parts

1572
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:22,460
on a male bud structure and y you can make seeds with this.

1573
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:25,627
Not all seeds are viable, done this way.

1574
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:29,161
And also you're not getting a full male line either.

1575
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:33,394
You're getting a regular seed line when you do male reversal.

1576
01:21:33,694 --> 01:21:35,795
So there's two things to understand there.

1577
01:21:35,795 --> 01:21:40,060
I mean, if you want to understand what junior male, it's definitely worth a shot.

1578
01:21:40,194 --> 01:21:41,194
Definitely do it.

1579
01:21:41,194 --> 01:21:44,260
Worth a shot to see what's in the genetics of this male.

1580
01:21:44,261 --> 01:21:45,095
You have,

1581
01:21:45,095 --> 01:21:45,427
you know,

1582
01:21:45,427 --> 01:21:46,860
if you think in our reverse

1583
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,228
M and try to make the seed see if they're viable, give them a pop

1584
01:21:50,228 --> 01:21:51,395
and see what's in the line.

1585
01:21:52,328 --> 01:21:53,795
Yeah, it's, it's doable.

1586
01:21:53,795 --> 01:21:56,728
It doesn't mean that it's going to be remotely easy

1587
01:21:56,728 --> 01:21:59,728
or it's always going to be viable, but it's definitely doable.

1588
01:22:01,095 --> 01:22:02,528
Yeah, Yeah.

1589
01:22:02,528 --> 01:22:05,328
And I think the rest of the question is quite similar to the previous one,

1590
01:22:05,328 --> 01:22:08,328
which is like if he does do this,

1591
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:13,627
how far should he take working the progeny?

1592
01:22:13,627 --> 01:22:15,460
And I guess it just comes back to what we said earlier.

1593
01:22:15,461 --> 01:22:18,461
Well, it depends on what you find when what your goal.

1594
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:21,561
Yeah, what your goal is,

1595
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,027
which he didn't specify.

1596
01:22:23,028 --> 01:22:27,528
So I think maybe then our response is mostly about the male reversal

1597
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:30,661
and what Yeah, you know

1598
01:22:30,728 --> 01:22:33,528
and you know what happens like often

1599
01:22:33,528 --> 01:22:36,395
floral, you know, reversals.

1600
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:37,461
Yeah. Gotcha.

1601
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:37,895
Gotcha.

1602
01:22:37,895 --> 01:22:40,895
Is there anything interesting to say about male reversals?

1603
01:22:40,994 --> 01:22:44,461
I mean, most people do it not to make most people do it not to make seeds.

1604
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:47,628
They do it to see what the chirping profile

1605
01:22:47,627 --> 01:22:51,394
like it to make the male produce more essential oils or oils.

1606
01:22:51,395 --> 01:22:55,161
So it could be so you can see what kind of traits maybe

1607
01:22:55,161 --> 01:22:57,028
it might be passing, you know, like,

1608
01:22:57,028 --> 01:23:00,195
oh, I can identify this is the male trait because I smell that in a male.

1609
01:23:00,795 --> 01:23:03,560
The resin glands on the male that we did on the reverse male

1610
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,560
I can smell that there and that wasn't in the female.

1611
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:05,860
So I know

1612
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:08,860
that's coming from the male side or it's most likely coming from the male side.

1613
01:23:09,661 --> 01:23:11,427
That helps in some scenarios

1614
01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:14,527
maybe.

1615
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:15,128
Okay.

1616
01:23:15,127 --> 01:23:17,927
I just I have my own question about this.

1617
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:19,060
Do it.

1618
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,393
Let's say you had your blue bonnet.

1619
01:23:21,394 --> 01:23:25,028
Male The you know, now almost like mythical bluebonnet.

1620
01:23:25,028 --> 01:23:29,194
Male Could you have so technically you could have reversed

1621
01:23:29,228 --> 01:23:32,461
that, you could have self that Yes.

1622
01:23:32,461 --> 01:23:33,694
And we'll get out of that.

1623
01:23:33,694 --> 01:23:36,094
Like, would that have been

1624
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:42,528
probably something similar to a F

1625
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:47,061
If I know in the line it probably would have been something

1626
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:50,493
similar to what I'm seeing in the blue bonnet.

1627
01:23:50,961 --> 01:23:54,094
The X1 or the F two is realistically, because it's already so uniform.

1628
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:59,293
So it just really didn't really serve a purpose in that sense in that scenario.

1629
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:00,293
Cool.

1630
01:24:00,293 --> 01:24:00,693
Nice.

1631
01:24:00,694 --> 01:24:03,694
Okay, that clarifies it for me.

1632
01:24:03,728 --> 01:24:05,993
Okay.

1633
01:24:05,993 --> 01:24:09,060
So I think those are the scenarios that we have for this week.

1634
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:09,993
Okay.

1635
01:24:09,993 --> 01:24:12,827
I don't I, I'm not assuming.

1636
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:17,494
Sorry, I'm I'm assuming that we will have more episodes if people have more

1637
01:24:18,493 --> 01:24:20,327
scenarios to suggest.

1638
01:24:20,328 --> 01:24:21,561
Sure.

1639
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,327
So if people still do,

1640
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:25,828
please keep sending them to me.

1641
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:30,261
And in the discourse on the in the content suggestions channel

1642
01:24:31,493 --> 01:24:33,728
for future episodes I think yeah man,

1643
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:37,161
I haven't really decided like how long this breeding series is going to be.

1644
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:39,694
So yeah, I was playing it by ear,

1645
01:24:39,694 --> 01:24:42,694
playing it by ear

1646
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,493
and you.

1647
01:24:45,493 --> 01:24:48,760
Okay, so I guess we've covered all the breeding scenarios, suggestions we've got.

1648
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:51,761
Matt Was there anything you want to add at this kind of like

1649
01:24:51,927 --> 01:24:53,827
wrap up of this section?

1650
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,228
No, not yet.

1651
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:57,094
I don't think so.

1652
01:24:57,094 --> 01:24:58,360
They were pretty cool. It was.

1653
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,493
I think what I can say is that

1654
01:25:00,493 --> 01:25:03,927
I can tell you that the vibe for this, this week's episode is so different

1655
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:07,127
from our very academic vibe last week, and I'm already enjoying it.

1656
01:25:07,161 --> 01:25:08,528
Not I didn't worry last week.

1657
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:11,661
It's just very different now it was just more,

1658
01:25:12,394 --> 01:25:16,028
I think, more brainpower involved in last week's for sure.

1659
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:18,894
Yeah, for me. Or was this thing more heavy?

1660
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,493
It definitely was for me as well, yeah.

1661
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:25,094
And it's nice to kind of have that now

1662
01:25:25,094 --> 01:25:28,094
as something we can reference and like point to.

1663
01:25:28,228 --> 01:25:31,228
But I'm also that is, and that got me to done it.

1664
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:32,194
Okay.

1665
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:35,194
Glad we did it too, baby.

1666
01:25:36,328 --> 01:25:36,994
It's not over yet.

1667
01:25:36,993 --> 01:25:40,094
Matt I wonder if I wonder if emcee White out like me

1668
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:43,094
whispering that into his face right here.

1669
01:25:44,261 --> 01:25:46,361
I love that my cover editor.

1670
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,360
Isn't that awesome?

1671
01:25:50,927 --> 01:25:51,394
Okay,

1672
01:25:51,394 --> 01:25:55,360
so we can wrap up with a couple of quite interesting questions about like

1673
01:25:56,028 --> 01:25:57,094
they are about breeding,

1674
01:25:57,094 --> 01:26:00,161
but they're also more about like supporting infrastructure.

1675
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:03,694
So McMuffin, for example, kind of wants to know

1676
01:26:03,694 --> 01:26:06,794
like how different breed is stay organized.

1677
01:26:07,594 --> 01:26:10,860
I think he specifically had a mention of like notes whether like like

1678
01:26:11,161 --> 01:26:14,627
you've developed your own like shorthand for things.

1679
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:18,094
You know, I know that you might have some stories from yourself and from like

1680
01:26:18,094 --> 01:26:22,793
maybe CC, yeah, what's organization like as like a commercial breeder?

1681
01:26:23,394 --> 01:26:29,094
So, like, me and CSI are the perfect, like, Polar opposites organization.

1682
01:26:30,627 --> 01:26:32,728
And I didn't really understand this.

1683
01:26:32,728 --> 01:26:33,927
I mean, I've seen like, you know,

1684
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:36,293
people talk about taking notes and notations and stuff,

1685
01:26:36,293 --> 01:26:39,161
but I really understand how organized someone could be

1686
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:43,328
when it came to breeding until like, he started showing me, like his paperwork

1687
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:47,128
on, like when he would go through and do testing on different things, you know,

1688
01:26:47,127 --> 01:26:47,793
like I'd watch.

1689
01:26:47,793 --> 01:26:50,793
It was just so everything is so detailed.

1690
01:26:51,127 --> 01:26:54,827
And he, you know, like, has everything written down, cataloged

1691
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:59,094
pictures, catalog like And when it came to me

1692
01:26:59,793 --> 01:27:02,327
I am the opposite like my organize

1693
01:27:02,328 --> 01:27:05,628
by organization, my life is just chaos, pure fricking chaos.

1694
01:27:05,627 --> 01:27:08,193
So I had never written anything.

1695
01:27:08,194 --> 01:27:09,594
Everything's been in my head.

1696
01:27:09,594 --> 01:27:10,694
And like I always kind of use

1697
01:27:10,694 --> 01:27:13,694
the reasoning that like, well, if anything ever happens, like,

1698
01:27:13,894 --> 01:27:19,228
I don't want to have anything out there to, you know, be or anything crazy. But

1699
01:27:20,228 --> 01:27:21,261
like, in the end, it

1700
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:24,261
really was just me being lazy because like, I'm just not organized.

1701
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,894
So I've tried doing it in my head, which it worked for a long, long,

1702
01:27:27,894 --> 01:27:32,228
long time until now, when I'm getting older and like,

1703
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:33,294
I'm not I don't want to say

1704
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:36,293
I'm getting older, like, you know, like other people, but like

1705
01:27:37,194 --> 01:27:39,794
further in my career and it's getting harder to remember a lot.

1706
01:27:39,793 --> 01:27:41,927
It's really getting harder to read certain details.

1707
01:27:41,927 --> 01:27:45,760
And I see why it does what it does, and I'm trying to incorporate

1708
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,494
it more in my life now too.

1709
01:27:47,493 --> 01:27:50,827
And this last year, out of the punchy stuff, I took better notes

1710
01:27:51,394 --> 01:27:53,961
and it was because of what I learned from him.

1711
01:27:53,961 --> 01:27:56,528
But yeah, he's a he's definitely a good mentor

1712
01:27:56,528 --> 01:27:59,528
to have when it comes to how to take notes and rotations.

1713
01:27:59,594 --> 01:28:01,328
And he does have somewhat of a shorthand.

1714
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,560
It's usually by tag

1715
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,460
number, by look, smell, taste.

1716
01:28:07,627 --> 01:28:09,693
I you know, and it's detailed.

1717
01:28:09,694 --> 01:28:13,661
It's very detailed because you want to be able to reference all those fine nuances

1718
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:17,493
and anything that can be construed or bred with as a trait you want to write down.

1719
01:28:18,728 --> 01:28:20,993
And that's not always readily apparent early on.

1720
01:28:20,993 --> 01:28:24,228
The one thing that I did used to do when I was super interested in reading purples

1721
01:28:24,694 --> 01:28:27,694
is that I took notes on all the tags

1722
01:28:27,728 --> 01:28:31,028
and I would always write down the color of the comments, How are you?

1723
01:28:31,028 --> 01:28:32,860
So I don't know.

1724
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,728
I'd always take I take notes on whether they were purple

1725
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:39,694
green to start with to see if there was any correlation to that in flower.

1726
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,627
And yeah, that was the first notes I'd ever taken on anything

1727
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:44,793
just because I was interested.

1728
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:49,827
But I can tell you that terribly long too far in.

1729
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:53,327
Yeah, I think,

1730
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:53,527
yeah.

1731
01:28:53,527 --> 01:28:55,293
For me it's like someone who comes from like,

1732
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:58,293
you know, information technology and like and all that.

1733
01:28:58,293 --> 01:29:01,661
Like I'd be, I'd have spreadsheets, have like a database.

1734
01:29:01,661 --> 01:29:04,426
I'd be like, I'd be going hard met.

1735
01:29:04,426 --> 01:29:05,993
We can collaborate on something.

1736
01:29:05,993 --> 01:29:06,226
Yeah.

1737
01:29:06,226 --> 01:29:10,293
And now no clarity, but yeah, and now that you're going to know me, do you see why?

1738
01:29:10,293 --> 01:29:13,594
Like, my personality is like, I have never kept shit.

1739
01:29:13,726 --> 01:29:16,594
I just don't like, I'm so scrambled with that.

1740
01:29:16,594 --> 01:29:20,793
At the same time, I feel like for you to have the kind of recall

1741
01:29:20,793 --> 01:29:24,993
that you do, you must have internally some.

1742
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:26,226
Some kind of like. Yeah.

1743
01:29:26,226 --> 01:29:29,493
Internal structure that your brain is using to.

1744
01:29:29,827 --> 01:29:30,061
Yeah.

1745
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:34,893
And I'm curious now what how that might be so like I've tried to stop doing it

1746
01:29:35,094 --> 01:29:35,961
like I'm a live feeds.

1747
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:38,327
I would do it a lot where I have to, like when I think of something,

1748
01:29:38,327 --> 01:29:41,427
I'd close my eyes real quick and I go to my file system in my brain

1749
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:45,226
that I've tried like visually doing and accessing it that way. But

1750
01:29:46,594 --> 01:29:47,426
yeah, I've got a lot of

1751
01:29:47,426 --> 01:29:50,426
brain fog now, so I don't it's not as easy to do that anymore.

1752
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:51,661
It used to be very visual.

1753
01:29:51,661 --> 01:29:53,926
Everything. It's very visual and cryptic.

1754
01:29:53,926 --> 01:29:55,760
And now I can't really do that anymore.

1755
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:57,927
There's a lot that isn't there.

1756
01:29:57,926 --> 01:29:58,193
Yeah.

1757
01:29:58,194 --> 01:30:02,061
So you're doing some kind of like a little bit of that, like Memory Palace type

1758
01:30:02,993 --> 01:30:04,326
type stuff. You heard of that?

1759
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:05,761
Where you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1760
01:30:05,761 --> 01:30:08,394
I've never been able to do that, I don't think.

1761
01:30:08,394 --> 01:30:11,127
But I think it's my form of that. Maybe.

1762
01:30:11,127 --> 01:30:14,394
Yeah, I think everyone has like some structure in their brain.

1763
01:30:14,394 --> 01:30:18,594
I see screenshots, screenshots, but they're not even visual screenshots.

1764
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:20,194
They're just,

1765
01:30:20,194 --> 01:30:23,127
I just think about it and it just places and it's fucking weird.

1766
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:25,661
I don't know. It's not even visual representations of anything.

1767
01:30:25,661 --> 01:30:26,761
It's just bullshit.

1768
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:29,027
Now maybe I just close my eyes and put it out my ass.

1769
01:30:29,027 --> 01:30:30,793
I'm not sure, but somehow worth.

1770
01:30:32,793 --> 01:30:33,426
That's interesting.

1771
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:36,893
Maybe I'll go and, like, build some little thing for this.

1772
01:30:37,293 --> 01:30:39,926
For fun. It'd be fun.

1773
01:30:39,926 --> 01:30:40,893
Okay. Yeah.

1774
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:45,194
I mean, I can easily see, like, a a very, very simple, like, breeder's notes

1775
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:49,694
kind of tool, which is not absolutely far beyond like a spreadsheet, but, you know,

1776
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,561
maybe it's not far beyond what you've done with the Codex, to be honest with you.

1777
01:30:53,726 --> 01:30:54,626
It's not either.

1778
01:30:54,627 --> 01:30:55,461
No, it's not.

1779
01:30:55,461 --> 01:30:58,461
Yeah, I could see like a

1780
01:30:58,761 --> 01:31:01,761
I mean, a lot of that would cross over a few years ago

1781
01:31:01,827 --> 01:31:04,860
I did say this years as well that the codex, even though currently

1782
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,860
it was intended for historical plots and projects,

1783
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:11,226
there's no reason why you can't use it to design projects

1784
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,161
or track your actual projects.

1785
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:17,194
So definitely something for us to think about for the future.

1786
01:31:17,194 --> 01:31:19,527
Definitely. That's cool. Okay,

1787
01:31:20,493 --> 01:31:22,760
so Kind of related

1788
01:31:22,761 --> 01:31:26,327
it still to me about like information

1789
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:30,094
and it's one that many people have,

1790
01:31:30,094 --> 01:31:33,094
like it's this one's from Humble FC in particular about my friend.

1791
01:31:33,226 --> 01:31:34,961
But Goodman was also asking me about this,

1792
01:31:34,961 --> 01:31:38,261
which is clarifying some of the terminology.

1793
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:41,627
So I can just say this off the top of my head, right?

1794
01:31:41,627 --> 01:31:46,894
You've got strains, you've got strands, you've got cultivars

1795
01:31:46,894 --> 01:31:51,694
varieties, you've got clones, you've got individual in general.

1796
01:31:52,493 --> 01:31:55,493
Yeah, you've got phenotype,

1797
01:31:55,827 --> 01:31:57,527
you've got lines.

1798
01:31:57,527 --> 01:32:00,327
And okay, I will say this, I'm actually not to me

1799
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:03,327
some of this stuff is still really blurry.

1800
01:32:03,827 --> 01:32:05,161
Some of it is not.

1801
01:32:05,161 --> 01:32:07,394
For example, I think I can immediately

1802
01:32:07,394 --> 01:32:11,161
say that a phenotype does not designate an individual plot, correct?

1803
01:32:11,161 --> 01:32:15,094
It is a particular expression of a single trait.

1804
01:32:17,461 --> 01:32:18,761
That is what a phenotype is.

1805
01:32:18,761 --> 01:32:22,361
But yeah, what about stuff like what is your understanding of like a cultivar

1806
01:32:23,493 --> 01:32:25,594
overall so or like so.

1807
01:32:25,594 --> 01:32:29,293
So I've always understood like cultivar as a cultivated variety

1808
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,594
and that like the simple definition is a plant variety

1809
01:32:32,594 --> 01:32:35,594
that has been produced in cultivation by selective breeding.

1810
01:32:36,394 --> 01:32:38,561
So a lot of this to me

1811
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,560
is very hard to call a cultivar

1812
01:32:42,426 --> 01:32:45,426
by the most stringent standards of the word.

1813
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:47,060
And like

1814
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:50,760
I'm not into that a lot, but some like verbiage I'm super anal about.

1815
01:32:50,761 --> 01:32:54,894
So it's hard to call a lot of these things cultivars, but some might be.

1816
01:32:56,527 --> 01:32:58,226
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:32:58,226 --> 01:33:02,193
But most like most cultivars are done with like

1818
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:05,661
root and stem cuttings, cell division

1819
01:33:06,694 --> 01:33:09,694
grafting,

1820
01:33:10,094 --> 01:33:13,094
like careful selective seed production.

1821
01:33:13,694 --> 01:33:16,927
And that's, that's a very, very specific

1822
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:21,460
qualifier for a cultivar

1823
01:33:21,461 --> 01:33:24,094
specific, selected,

1824
01:33:24,094 --> 01:33:27,094
carefully selected seed selection.

1825
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:30,661
So yeah, some things I think would qualify and others wouldn't.

1826
01:33:31,094 --> 01:33:35,226
Or cultivar have a everyone's favorite strain, right?

1827
01:33:35,226 --> 01:33:38,226
Because I think we can immediately say, for example,

1828
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:40,894
Kim Dog 91 is not a strain.

1829
01:33:40,894 --> 01:33:43,394
Is anything actually a strain like in cannabis?

1830
01:33:43,394 --> 01:33:44,793
Like I know. Okay.

1831
01:33:44,793 --> 01:33:48,793
From a technical point of view, I know that like strains I use for like viruses.

1832
01:33:49,594 --> 01:33:53,060
Yes, in a technical sense, right.

1833
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:56,394
But for in cannabis land, people use it as just like a catch all term

1834
01:33:56,461 --> 01:33:59,461
for like anything that has a name almost,

1835
01:33:59,761 --> 01:34:02,794
whether that's like a like across

1836
01:34:03,394 --> 01:34:05,994
or an actual individual keeper,

1837
01:34:05,993 --> 01:34:09,793
people will still just freely say that's a strain or like that's a strain or

1838
01:34:12,226 --> 01:34:12,993
I think

1839
01:34:12,993 --> 01:34:16,027
so there's a few different definitions of strains out there, right?

1840
01:34:16,027 --> 01:34:19,993
Like most people in there for two strains are referring to like diseases, viruses

1841
01:34:20,793 --> 01:34:24,993
or like strains of Indo mycorrhizal or bacteria.

1842
01:34:25,127 --> 01:34:25,961
Right?

1843
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:29,793
But there is also a definition of a strain and it's

1844
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:34,760
and it's in connection with what is it like?

1845
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:37,760
Just I'm trying to think of the word

1846
01:34:40,627 --> 01:34:41,660
a plant

1847
01:34:41,659 --> 01:34:45,327
that has been modified through selective breeding

1848
01:34:45,827 --> 01:34:48,827
or through breeding that say selective breeding, through breeding.

1849
01:34:49,194 --> 01:34:52,460
So yeah, it applies in cannabis.

1850
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:57,960
It actually does apply and is correct while strain seems to apply to most things

1851
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,194
because it doesn't necessarily specify careful,

1852
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:05,659
super controlled selective breeding, it just says done with selective breeding.

1853
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:07,193
And that can be many different things

1854
01:35:07,194 --> 01:35:09,760
that can mean many different things to many different people.

1855
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,494
So I think it more applies overall than cultivar does.

1856
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:15,559
Specifically,

1857
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:19,660
should people be arguing to their blue in the face on that?

1858
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:21,693
But yeah, that's my take on it.

1859
01:35:21,694 --> 01:35:25,760
I can say this from the point of view of like the English language at large

1860
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,127
and like it's used in different and fields.

1861
01:35:29,793 --> 01:35:33,926
Just because one term is used in one field doesn't mean you can assume

1862
01:35:33,926 --> 01:35:35,226
that that is the correct definition.

1863
01:35:35,226 --> 01:35:36,926
In every field

1864
01:35:36,926 --> 01:35:40,726
there are many fields that use the same terms in very different ways.

1865
01:35:41,394 --> 01:35:45,793
So just because you've heard the term strain in like virology, I don't know.

1866
01:35:45,793 --> 01:35:47,527
I'm not I don't actually know what those things are called.

1867
01:35:47,527 --> 01:35:49,659
But, you know, just because you've heard that term used in

1868
01:35:49,659 --> 01:35:53,960
another technical context doesn't mean that that's the only meaning that it has.

1869
01:35:56,359 --> 01:35:59,559
So I think that goes back to to what you're saying about strain.

1870
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,360
Okay.

1871
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:03,293
In terms of like separating an individual

1872
01:36:03,293 --> 01:36:06,293
plot from a line, what would you say about that?

1873
01:36:06,426 --> 01:36:07,426
Like, what do you mean?

1874
01:36:07,426 --> 01:36:10,426
Because sometimes, you know, in a cross you'd see like

1875
01:36:13,293 --> 01:36:14,827
this parent by that parent.

1876
01:36:14,827 --> 01:36:17,627
But like, that's obviously an individual.

1877
01:36:17,627 --> 01:36:20,627
It doesn't make the entire line, right, Like that kind of thing.

1878
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:26,394
So when I say expression, I, it could be I use it very loosely when I say

1879
01:36:26,394 --> 01:36:31,360
expression because it could be like a like using a trait expression.

1880
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:34,159
But I tend to use it for Plant's overall expression.

1881
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:38,827
How it's expressing in that and by reason, I say, is because it's how it's overall

1882
01:36:38,827 --> 01:36:41,159
expression is in that particular environment

1883
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:44,159
with that particular stringent set of variables.

1884
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,460
So expression works well with me.

1885
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:49,060
Like that's, that's a term that does work.

1886
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:52,060
But a lot of people say that phenotype,

1887
01:36:52,359 --> 01:36:56,426
that's the phenotype from that line and phenotype is refer,

1888
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:01,493
referring to a specific trait expression, not the overall plant.

1889
01:37:01,894 --> 01:37:04,494
The overall plant is not the phenotype.

1890
01:37:04,493 --> 01:37:09,826
You can say the genotype is x, y, Z, and that's

1891
01:37:09,827 --> 01:37:14,127
relating to the genes behind the X, the phenotype, physical expression.

1892
01:37:14,127 --> 01:37:17,727
But the genotype isn't something you're necessarily visually seen,

1893
01:37:18,226 --> 01:37:20,827
it's something that no, the underlying genes,

1894
01:37:20,827 --> 01:37:24,394
no, by definition it's not what you are observing by definition.

1895
01:37:24,394 --> 01:37:25,427
Yeah, Yeah.

1896
01:37:25,426 --> 01:37:29,793
And I think the other term I've heard, I think I use with

1897
01:37:29,793 --> 01:37:34,394
when you're talking about the plants and just to use the term individuals,

1898
01:37:35,194 --> 01:37:38,827
this is a that's great to probably be to individual.

1899
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:40,594
Yep. Yeah.

1900
01:37:40,594 --> 01:37:42,627
And that applies very well.

1901
01:37:42,627 --> 01:37:46,294
Very, very well and strand things like that.

1902
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:50,493
You know obviously that's not much, but it's cool that people do it anyways.

1903
01:37:51,159 --> 01:37:56,159
There's also like the other things I hear are providence instead of Providence.

1904
01:37:56,493 --> 01:37:57,659
Like there's a lot of terms

1905
01:37:57,659 --> 01:38:01,559
that people have tried to move on in or use and adapt to don't quite fit.

1906
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,294
But yeah, those are the two big ones.

1907
01:38:03,293 --> 01:38:05,394
Strand In Providence.

1908
01:38:05,394 --> 01:38:08,627
I think that when you get strands from Strain,

1909
01:38:08,627 --> 01:38:11,627
I think in linguistics it's called like a, it's a kind of slippage.

1910
01:38:11,926 --> 01:38:14,094
It's what you call it, if I'm not mistaken.

1911
01:38:15,394 --> 01:38:17,027
But you know, I don't know.

1912
01:38:17,027 --> 01:38:20,027
I think one one thing I'll say is that

1913
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:24,460
you have people on one end who think, Oh, fuck it, It just doesn't matter.

1914
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,594
Like, as long as generally people know what I mean.

1915
01:38:26,594 --> 01:38:27,560
It's okay.

1916
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,694
And you have people on the other end who are like, almost like unwilling

1917
01:38:30,694 --> 01:38:35,227
to communicate with you unless you have like, locked everything.

1918
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,793
And we're never going to get to that end either.

1919
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:41,793
Like, it comes back to what you were saying, Matt, about like,

1920
01:38:43,027 --> 01:38:46,594
there's unfortunately, unfortunately, a bit of a blurry line

1921
01:38:46,594 --> 01:38:50,827
between the established scientific terms and some of the terms

1922
01:38:50,827 --> 01:38:53,894
that we consistently use as a community of practitioners.

1923
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,793
And we unfortunately are going to have to deal with some of that

1924
01:38:59,793 --> 01:39:01,594
ambiguity

1925
01:39:01,594 --> 01:39:05,694
because language just isn't perfect and we definitely don't

1926
01:39:05,694 --> 01:39:08,694
have perfect language for what we're doing yet.

1927
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:12,394
Hopefully one day we will get closer.

1928
01:39:12,394 --> 01:39:13,927
But I think so.

1929
01:39:13,926 --> 01:39:17,226
I just think that either end of the spectrum is not for me.

1930
01:39:17,226 --> 01:39:18,993
Like it doesn't really make sense either way.

1931
01:39:18,993 --> 01:39:22,059
Like you can't just say anything goes and you can't say like,

1932
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,527
we have to have it perfect before we can talk.

1933
01:39:24,527 --> 01:39:27,127
There's obviously some kind of sweet spot between those two, and that's

1934
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:30,127
where we are,

1935
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:30,859
I think.

1936
01:39:30,859 --> 01:39:33,859
So as a language person who's going to say that, Yeah,

1937
01:39:34,627 --> 01:39:37,094
yeah.

1938
01:39:37,094 --> 01:39:37,894
Okay.

1939
01:39:37,894 --> 01:39:41,360
Um, those are the two questions, miscellaneous questions

1940
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:44,359
that we throw in there to wrap this episode up.

1941
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:49,293
Maybe I did want to gesture towards some possible future episodes.

1942
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,760
I'm like I said, we might just have another episode

1943
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,793
that's kind of similar to this. So people have more

1944
01:39:54,827 --> 01:39:58,027
scenarios that are different enough from the ones we've covered today.

1945
01:39:58,027 --> 01:40:00,659
Maybe we'll do another episode.

1946
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:02,926
There's a possible suggestion from queer

1947
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:06,092
to do a separate episode on bass lines.

1948
01:40:06,693 --> 01:40:07,360
Oh yeah.

1949
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:10,527
When when we say bass lines, I think Matt has referred to that in the past

1950
01:40:10,527 --> 01:40:14,827
as like the big names like Haze Skunk, What else is in them?

1951
01:40:14,827 --> 01:40:17,827
Met were nights for the lights.

1952
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:22,726
There's Durban, there's there's a lot, there's a few overalls

1953
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:26,492
but like majority speaking skunk one or lights or big three.

1954
01:40:27,226 --> 01:40:27,527
Yeah.

1955
01:40:27,527 --> 01:40:30,527
So the kind of major precursors that

1956
01:40:31,127 --> 01:40:35,193
can link the upstream parents, the upstream nodes to a lot of the

1957
01:40:35,859 --> 01:40:36,992
cannabis that we see today.

1958
01:40:36,993 --> 01:40:40,427
The majority in majority. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1959
01:40:40,426 --> 01:40:43,426
And that could be cool for an episode. Yeah.

1960
01:40:43,659 --> 01:40:48,193
The other exciting possibility is we may get high lonesome back for

1961
01:40:49,292 --> 01:40:51,992
another episode because he did tell me

1962
01:40:51,993 --> 01:40:56,960
that he would be quite keen to speak on breeding for obsessives

1963
01:40:57,627 --> 01:41:02,327
and also to speak on his Appalachian project, which obviously, you know, is a

1964
01:41:03,027 --> 01:41:06,159
is a big story and has, you know, many twists and turns.

1965
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:09,159
So that would be very fun to do.

1966
01:41:09,726 --> 01:41:11,659
So there's plenty plenty for for people

1967
01:41:11,659 --> 01:41:14,659
to look forward to and the upcoming episodes.

1968
01:41:14,726 --> 01:41:15,792
Absolutely.

1969
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:20,027
And let's see, we also have the sea

1970
01:41:20,027 --> 01:41:23,027
to custom glass.

1971
01:41:23,127 --> 01:41:26,127
Just I, I think tomorrow I get to see the Breeders

1972
01:41:26,127 --> 01:41:29,860
Syndicate versions of their glass pieces for the first time.

1973
01:41:30,226 --> 01:41:31,592
So I'm super stoked.

1974
01:41:31,592 --> 01:41:34,893
And I think that's one one thing like I've talked about it

1975
01:41:34,893 --> 01:41:37,893
like you get leveled up every once in a while

1976
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:41,426
in certain things and like glass is not my forte, right?

1977
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:42,992
And I didn't, I don't,

1978
01:41:42,993 --> 01:41:45,527
I didn't really understand it being anything more than just

1979
01:41:45,527 --> 01:41:48,960
a thing to get from point A to point B until at all right.

1980
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:51,393
To get from point A to point B, smoked to lungs.

1981
01:41:51,393 --> 01:41:52,859
But I didn't really understand that.

1982
01:41:52,859 --> 01:41:54,692
Like, there are certain techniques

1983
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:57,726
that can be used in glass for making things clear fast

1984
01:41:57,726 --> 01:42:01,492
and like these are overall so much better than any piece that I've ever had.

1985
01:42:01,493 --> 01:42:02,493
Like the fact

1986
01:42:02,493 --> 01:42:05,793
that we get to have like Breeders Syndicate random ones blows my mind.

1987
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:10,126
That's that's endgame game a game capture it So props to them.

1988
01:42:10,127 --> 01:42:13,460
I'm stoked to show them show them to everyone and make them available

1989
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,460
to to everyone, which is Brad It's epic.

1990
01:42:16,627 --> 01:42:17,827
So yeah, I'm stoked about that.

1991
01:42:18,893 --> 01:42:19,493
I do want to add

1992
01:42:19,493 --> 01:42:22,893
one more thing while we're doing this kind of like outro, like

1993
01:42:23,693 --> 01:42:26,693
I've been watching our stats and I'm really, really pleased to see

1994
01:42:26,693 --> 01:42:30,527
that the engagement for the last few episodes has really gone up.

1995
01:42:30,659 --> 01:42:33,992
Like we're getting the most comments that we've ever gotten really like,

1996
01:42:34,327 --> 01:42:36,226
Yeah, in our recent episodes,

1997
01:42:36,226 --> 01:42:39,393
you know, not like very, very old videos that have been around for years.

1998
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:43,226
Yeah, we are getting like as almost as many comments as those in the

1999
01:42:43,493 --> 01:42:44,993
in the space of like a couple of weeks.

2000
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:47,993
So yeah, I'm really stuck about that.

2001
01:42:48,592 --> 01:42:51,592
You commenting keep keep interacting,

2002
01:42:51,693 --> 01:42:55,527
you know like I like engaging with people in the comments because it's fun.

2003
01:42:55,527 --> 01:42:59,060
Like it just takes the episode further, learning further and I actually

2004
01:42:59,493 --> 01:43:02,193
some of the comments like if you go through there, like you'll

2005
01:43:02,193 --> 01:43:06,260
catch like old vets talking in there that'll say who they are and will realize,

2006
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:09,659
Oh shit, that's that person, you know, and people chime in that are really cool.

2007
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,027
Yeah.

2008
01:43:11,027 --> 01:43:13,592
It's also the place where like if you're not in the discord

2009
01:43:13,592 --> 01:43:15,726
because obviously people can use the discord to do this.

2010
01:43:15,726 --> 01:43:17,460
It's also the place where if you

2011
01:43:18,393 --> 01:43:19,393
disagree with anything that

2012
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:22,760
we said or you have more questions like definitely bring them up there.

2013
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,726
Because like I said last week,

2014
01:43:24,726 --> 01:43:28,960
we're not going to always be perfect and we're going to make mistakes.

2015
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,627
We're going to miss out on some things.

2016
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:33,627
So he's going to keep prompting us because I don't

2017
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:38,226
keep prompting us because we can always follow up.

2018
01:43:38,226 --> 01:43:41,792
Like actually I mentioned that, like, for example, it wasn't in the comments,

2019
01:43:41,792 --> 01:43:46,027
but not so actually popped up in the chat last week to kind of clarify

2020
01:43:46,027 --> 01:43:50,627
that apply can actually be true breeding just for one trait.

2021
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:51,926
Yeah.

2022
01:43:51,926 --> 01:43:54,759
And that that's not the same as a plant being breeding

2023
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,760
for a whole bunch of significant traits.

2024
01:43:57,827 --> 01:43:59,193
And that's true. That's true.

2025
01:43:59,193 --> 01:44:03,393
So you could have one trait that your plan could be breeding

2026
01:44:03,859 --> 01:44:06,859
you homozygous dominant for one trait,

2027
01:44:06,993 --> 01:44:10,093
and that's technically a true breeding plot for that traits.

2028
01:44:10,527 --> 01:44:12,893
But you could also have a plant that's like, you know,

2029
01:44:12,893 --> 01:44:14,827
homozygous dominant for a whole bunch of them.

2030
01:44:14,827 --> 01:44:17,427
And then you have something that's a transition.

2031
01:44:17,426 --> 01:44:21,492
Quite one of those more like more like a quote unquote idol.

2032
01:44:21,493 --> 01:44:23,627
Right? And that and that set of terms.

2033
01:44:23,627 --> 01:44:24,827
So yeah, sorry.

2034
01:44:24,827 --> 01:44:28,460
Random example of like, you know, good little follow ups here and there.

2035
01:44:28,592 --> 01:44:29,292
Yeah, it is.

2036
01:44:31,092 --> 01:44:31,792
All right.

2037
01:44:31,792 --> 01:44:34,792
So with that, I guess me say

2038
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:37,927
you forget to join the discord though, for clicking

2039
01:44:37,926 --> 01:44:41,726
forget to click like subscribe, share all that good stuff.

2040
01:44:41,726 --> 01:44:42,592
The things you're

2041
01:44:42,592 --> 01:44:46,426
supposed to do to be supportive, that shows you like I guess it does help.

2042
01:44:46,493 --> 01:44:48,927
It really does help like it does.

2043
01:44:48,926 --> 01:44:49,792
So please do.

2044
01:44:49,792 --> 01:44:53,460
And or just like if you fucking hate it, that's cool too.

2045
01:44:55,193 --> 01:44:57,226
I think that is it.

2046
01:44:57,226 --> 01:44:59,659
Anything else? You got any?

2047
01:44:59,659 --> 01:45:01,260
That's it for me.

2048
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,592
Thank you. Every Cheers.

2049
01:45:03,592 --> 01:45:06,527
Thanks for us here at Readers Syndicate List.

2050
01:45:06,527 --> 01:45:08,827
Next we catch you.
