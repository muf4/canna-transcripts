1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,299
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,059
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,340
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,340
to the underground

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,219
welcome to Peter's Syndicate I'm here

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,839
with local botanist our very good friend

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,359
from the breeder Syndicate and we have

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
thousand fold here to help me Host this

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,920
um thousand do you want to tell them

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,839
what we're going to be talking about

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,780
today

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
yeah welcome everybody so last week we

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,280
covered the technical aspects of the

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,620
seed making process and as we promised

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,420
this episode is the first episode in a

29
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,298
series on breeding

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,400
so some disclaimers to start us off

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,220
breeding is a huge and extremely complex

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,978
topic we are not authorities and cannot

33
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,840
promise perfect information and you know

34
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,219
I'll do my best and I'm sure the other

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,079
two will do their best as well to

36
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,420
signpost clearly when

37
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,000
we're uncertain or when we just don't

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,780
know

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,140
why

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,000
you're gonna lie okay

41
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,560
today's episode will be an overview on

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,959
some of the science and theory behind

43
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,960
breeding and where it does and does not

44
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,879
meet up with the Practical reality

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,739
again because breeding is such a big and

46
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,679
complex topic we're going to try to draw

47
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,118
a loose parameter around it uh perimeter

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,220
I should say around it

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,900
um a Line in the Sand so we have a

50
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,399
foundation to work from for the

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,100
subsequent episodes

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,560
in the subsequent episodes we I think

53
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,199
will want to cover different historical

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,680
or hypothetical breeding scenarios and

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,659
that will allow us to get more into the

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,659
particularities nuances of breeding

57
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,419
um

58
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,219
yeah in terms of how today's show is

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,738
going to be laid out

60
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,340
um we're going to first of all cover the

61
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,620
or gesture towards the mendelian science

62
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,020
behind breeding and some of its limits

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,120
we're then going to move on to an

64
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,459
overview of breeding techniques and

65
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,280
strategies and kind of give

66
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,780
an isolated account of each with a

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,539
little bit of context

68
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,520
and finally we'll summarize

69
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,598
um with the section called what makes

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,599
breeding so hard

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,800
but yeah without further Ado I wanted to

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,560
dive into

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,420
some of the science behind reading

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
um specifically

75
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,738
the science drawn from Mendel's

76
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,559
principles so the mendelian framework of

77
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,140
breeding because

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,120
this is many I think many of us have

79
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,878
this as a reference point many of us

80
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,379
have maybe picked us up at high school

81
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,878
or you know it's pretty easy to pick up

82
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,039
now if you haven't come across this

83
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,840
before and I do recommend it

84
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,179
um I'm not going to actually teach

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,459
people what this is but what I will say

86
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,540
is that

87
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,699
Mendel's principles of inheritance

88
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,679
provide like a basic understanding of

89
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,238
how traits are passed from parents to

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,719
offspring

91
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,000
and kind of laid the basis for modern

92
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,039
breeding in the 20th century

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,439
so indeed paired pretty closely with

94
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,539
that is the Punnett square and some of

95
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,219
you will be familiar with that it's

96
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,060
basically a little table that helps you

97
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,979
predict potential outcomes of crosses

98
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,019
between two individuals it's like a

99
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,000
visual representation of the possible

100
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,459
combination of alleles

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,620
and helps you determine like the

102
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,378
genotypic and phenotypic ratios for The

103
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,560
Offspring yes but

104
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:58,079
again trying to draw a line around that

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,979
essentially the tool is meant to help

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,540
you

107
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,378
predict design and control your breeding

108
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,579
project

109
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,318
correct

110
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,879
um

111
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,079
and why I wanted to start with this is

112
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,359
because

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,219
I think there's actually quite a big

114
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,819
disconnect between

115
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,079
that idealized simplified theory of

116
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,560
breeding

117
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,478
and the actual reality of breeding I

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,399
would agree

119
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,918
yeah I mean

120
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,198
before I kind of dive into some of the

121
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,060
reasons why that is I don't know Matt

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,400
did you or local did you want to say

123
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,280
anything about

124
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:42,620
you know your Vibe with

125
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,619
the mendelian stuff in general

126
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,539
um not off of the top of my head

127
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,339
so with with Mendel's stuff in general

128
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,319
that's like you said it's usually the

129
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,779
first place a lot of people encounter

130
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,540
any kind of genetic uh learning whether

131
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,779
it's in high school or you know uh

132
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,720
College uh intro level botany class or

133
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:06,539
even biology for that matter

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,080
um yeah it's it's an intro based on

135
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,879
one-to-one pairings of the wells

136
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,300
um a lot of times that means very simple

137
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,918
traits in an IBL uh we can go more into

138
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,620
that too so people understand what that

139
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,159
means but basically it's the idea behind

140
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,439
it is a very uniform predictable lying

141
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,080
cross to another uniform predictable lie

142
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,800
and what will come from those pairings

143
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,719
when there are very simple traits uh be

144
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,300
it parents with blue eyes parents with

145
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,680
brown eyes very simple one-to-one trait

146
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,139
reading

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,439
I think that's a perfect place to start

148
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,079
um and yeah so like Matt said the simple

149
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,639
mendelian framework first of all assumes

150
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,918
that well not first of all but generally

151
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,860
assumes that traits are like easily

152
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,478
identifiable easily measurable and that

153
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,100
their each trade is controlled by a

154
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,839
single Gene so there's like a one-to-one

155
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,660
correspondence between the trade and

156
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,339
Gene for for this model to kind of like

157
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,840
be at its best

158
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,519
so we actually have our first question

159
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,339
here as well which I think is quite

160
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,198
important in the winner asks I really

161
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,599
want to know what it's meant by true

162
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,000
breeding I understand past traits but

163
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,539
what is the test to make sure that it's

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,538
true

165
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,780
um so I will say this that in terms of

166
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,360
science

167
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,179
um attributing trait or plant means that

168
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,379
it is homozygous for that trait or if

169
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,418
you're talking about a Pure Line in

170
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,579
journal you're saying that those parts

171
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:35,758
are homozygous

172
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:37,198
um for most traits yes local does that

173
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,020
sound right to you

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,660
um yeah that makes sense

175
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,399
and like I kind of am curious from a

176
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,800
practical point of view if you don't

177
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,719
have the science how how can you tell

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,759
whether something a trait or a plant is

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,600
true breeding only by observing the

180
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,180
progeny that's like the simple basic way

181
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,500
um should you have to give examples

182
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,519
on this

183
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,060
sure

184
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,519
so like uh example Blue Bonnet

185
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,879
um it's a worker blueberry line

186
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,779
um we knew that just from

187
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,819
uh

188
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,779
practical data from other people having

189
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:18,860
grown it that it typically in most rooms

190
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,179
would Express heavily blueberry terpenes

191
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,580
with that said we didn't know that it

192
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,038
would necessarily breed true for those

193
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,439
traits meaning anything it's crossed to

194
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,060
or whatever it's crossed to we didn't

195
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,939
know for sure if it would pass those

196
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,199
berry traits consistently you know and

197
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,360
that would be true so we were trying to

198
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,759
see if it was true reading for a single

199
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,979
trait so in those crosses when we did

200
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,720
them most of the time no matter what it

201
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,418
was crossed to the berry traits were

202
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,860
dominant therefore it's not totally true

203
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,659
breeding but it's more true breeding

204
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,660
than most plants you'll find in cannons

205
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,620
yeah um I'll also add on that you kind

206
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,439
of have to look for something to breed

207
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,019
Truth for one trait like you can't

208
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,199
assume that one plant's gonna breathe

209
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:09,060
true for like six different traits you

210
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,000
know in this you have to kind of Target

211
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,160
a single trade yeah

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,899
um that's a big thing to notice too in

213
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,360
cannabis or to to note

214
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,918
yeah yeah yeah

215
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,720
for sure

216
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,519
um and I think that that takes me to our

217
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,400
next Point as well you know one of the

218
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,359
other reasons why it's so difficult to

219
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,638
apply

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,000
Mendel's model like Matt already said is

221
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,560
that we have a distinct lack of fixed or

222
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,820
true breeding traits and true

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,139
homozygosity in cannabis right so

224
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,300
there's another little narrative that

225
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,098
comes out of Mendel's framework which

226
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,278
people love to refer to

227
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,920
which is the idea that you have two you

228
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,200
begin with two true breeding parents

229
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,899
you cross them to produce a true F1

230
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,820
hybrid with heterosis and hybrid Vigor

231
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,159
right people have to spin this narrative

232
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,540
well you also have to say that they're

233
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,319
if you're going to make a true F1 hybrid

234
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:06,899
it has to be too distinctly

235
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,640
uh distinct and different genotypes

236
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,440
that's that's one of the other most

237
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,699
important parts for a true F1 hybrid it

238
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,680
has to be two distinctly different

239
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,820
genotypes

240
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,739
sure

241
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,660
and then people also like to talk about

242
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,778
the fact that yep in a true F1 hybrid

243
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,958
population it's meant to be homogeneous

244
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:26,700
if you have two properly homozygous

245
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,139
parents correct

246
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,600
um but that doesn't happen in cannabis

247
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,519
I'll say that oh right and second

248
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
secondly the stage that's meant to

249
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,419
follow that

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,159
is the F2 stage and according to

251
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,740
Mendel's model when you begin with two

252
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,159
true breeding distinct parents

253
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,039
it's in the F2 Generation where you're

254
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,659
meant to see genotypic segregation

255
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,860
correct

256
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,139
however

257
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,560
in our world you couldn't see

258
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,899
segregation probably at every generation

259
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,679
correct so this model

260
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,839
doesn't work on that point no

261
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,259
um and it is interesting to me when I

262
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,260
think about

263
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,519
um

264
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,440
what you make of a pack of seats that

265
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,000
you bought that says

266
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,640
F1 F2

267
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,700
because you know people make assumptions

268
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:24,860
based on Mendel's framework they sure do

269
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,860
what what those things actually mean

270
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,259
um okay so in addition to that that

271
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:34,439
Narrative of the true F1 hybrid going to

272
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,439
F2 with segregation some of the other

273
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,660
reasons why we can't easily apply

274
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Mendel's framework

275
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,860
um one there's something called

276
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,360
polygenic traits I.E these are single

277
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,060
traits that could be controlled by

278
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,579
multiple genes

279
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,539
and again if you look at Mendel's

280
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:53,039
framework

281
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:55,980
they're meant to be one-to-one

282
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,659
correspondences so that already adds a

283
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,879
significant amount of complexity to your

284
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:02,399
search or your experiment

285
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,720
the next one is genetic linkage so you

286
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,700
have genes that are kind of grouped

287
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,100
linked within the same chromosome that

288
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,660
further complicates your efforts to kind

289
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,600
of like isolate

290
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,399
uh correspondences yep

291
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,159
um you have something else called I

292
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,379
don't know if I'm saying this term right

293
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:22,019
pleiotropy pleiotropia trophy I think

294
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,419
yeah where it's one gene that actually

295
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,700
affects multiple traits so it's the it's

296
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,439
the inverse of polygenic where

297
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,259
polygenics one trait control by multiple

298
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:35,040
genes this is one gene affecting

299
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:37,439
multiple traits yes so I think they're

300
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,719
actually even more yeah there's there's

301
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,019
a a really important one when it comes

302
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,759
to cannabis called suppressor traits and

303
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,339
um and and that's another version of the

304
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,439
link trait and suppressor traits instead

305
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,180
of like a linked trait being like if

306
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,740
this trait is here in this plant and

307
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,659
this trade is here in this plant all of

308
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,339
a sudden you see this this trait that

309
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:59,100
you hadn't seen before because it needs

310
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,200
both factors to show it uh with a

311
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,300
suppressor trait it's the opposite

312
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,700
needs both traits to suppress it and all

313
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,319
of a sudden this trade is gone whereas

314
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,540
like both parents may have something

315
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,120
that you think is awesome but for

316
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,639
whatever reason certain alleles or or

317
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,320
Genies line up differently and then once

318
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,019
across that suppressor trait completely

319
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,519
suppresses a specific trait so that's

320
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,659
also in there too and a super important

321
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,220
cannabis

322
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:26,539
um it's been Neville used to refer to it

323
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,540
as the ghost trait

324
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,539
um

325
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,759
also add

326
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,278
um I was reading earlier

327
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,860
um that there are uh you know obviously

328
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,078
what we call uh dominant traits but

329
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,879
they're like additive traits you know

330
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,638
kind of the opposite of your suppressor

331
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,740
trait that you were talking about so I

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,959
guess you know here's an example since I

333
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,120
can't really speak at you know at a

334
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,439
strain level you know

335
00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:00,240
um so say uh we have fish in the wild

336
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,000
um there's this a gene a uh you know one

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,539
that allows for it to have

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,159
um

339
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,860
you know

340
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,338
it Blends in so it's not heavily

341
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,019
predated right and then there are these

342
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,700
additive genes that are going to have to

343
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,980
do with size

344
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:23,339
and so that fish can if it has that

345
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,039
dominant gene will be true for that you

346
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:29,240
know uh less lesser amount of predation

347
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,919
Gene but you know have variable

348
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,680
variability in size due to those like

349
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,740
additive you know type genes

350
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,039
um it's still gonna be true for that

351
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,399
like anti-predation

352
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,919
Gene but you're gonna have these other

353
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,600
influences that are not really going to

354
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,278
affect that dominant Gene's effect

355
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,980
gotcha

356
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,620
gotcha I'm not sure if that that really

357
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,659
oh yeah that's no that's super cool

358
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,740
I think you know for me this preparing

359
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,240
for this episode has been really

360
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,539
different from the other ones because

361
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,339
the other ones I could kind of like

362
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:07,740
Loosely sketch the structure off the top

363
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,019
of my head whereas this one because I am

364
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,459
an amateur obviously I actually have to

365
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,620
do a bit of like

366
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,599
personal investigation you know like

367
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,039
actual some actual research and so a lot

368
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,200
of these a lot of the points I just made

369
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,000
are new things that I've learned and

370
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,379
it's it's amazing to me

371
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,879
um just how complex and wild the reality

372
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,600
of

373
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,240
um like you know uh sexual reproduction

374
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,060
and and all the complexities

375
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,419
um of the genetics are

376
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,458
um so yeah I've used this example

377
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,379
several times and we probably won't get

378
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,679
into epigenetics because it's so little

379
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:49,259
known about it especially but yeah but

380
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,419
um the example I I that is kind of like

381
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,759
a paradigm shift for me was learning

382
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:56,698
that a male that smokes one single

383
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,679
cigarette right and he smokes one single

384
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:01,379
cigarette it'll affect his progeny down

385
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,939
for Generations through epigenetics and

386
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:06,360
that's like a scientific that's like in

387
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,920
paper papers now so that that really

388
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,778
blew my mind because if you think about

389
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,819
the stressors that we put our cannabis

390
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,519
through and the epigenetics and all that

391
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,620
like you can imagine how far down we are

392
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,740
affecting progeny without even realizing

393
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,500
what we're breeding so I absolutely

394
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,120
yeah an environmental factors it's

395
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,198
important for breeders to be competent

396
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,060
Growers

397
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,240
for that reason

398
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,919
yeah environmental factors in general

399
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,799
um can't be covered by this model of

400
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,879
heritability it's It's precisely the one

401
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,939
of the major things that's being

402
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:41,100
excluded yeah

403
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,320
yeah so I guess

404
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,500
those are kind of the general points

405
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,778
that I wanted to gesture towards and it

406
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,379
was mostly to name

407
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:53,100
um

408
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:56,159
some of the many reasons why you cannot

409
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,500
just say hey take that framework and now

410
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,500
just slap it on because

411
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,159
this science is a simplified idealized

412
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,379
model yes very idealized it's not a

413
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,519
one-size-fit-all

414
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,259
um at all so um I think I was I kind of

415
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,419
want to conclude this section just by

416
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,799
saying like it doesn't mean that we have

417
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,039
to throw all the signs out the window

418
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,899
they're obviously still really really

419
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,919
important principles that mendels

420
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,419
outlined that absolutely relate

421
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,939
um and there's so many kind of

422
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,278
techniques and strategies for breeding

423
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,699
that come out of these principles

424
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,500
that are still fundamental to Modern

425
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,819
breeding

426
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,379
um maybe the last thing I just wanted to

427
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,120
also

428
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,458
throw a mention at which we won't go

429
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,220
into is of course there's there's much

430
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,559
more modern science now Beyond Mendel we

431
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,019
have Micro assisted breeding

432
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,439
and stuff like that but that's going to

433
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:57,419
be outside the scope of our talk today I

434
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,279
think definitely since I don't do any

435
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,278
marker assisted braiding I could not

436
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,958
talk confidently of it

437
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,599
does do we have people doing that in

438
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,359
cannabis yet Chimera doing like we know

439
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,578
of chimera we know he's done some great

440
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,519
marker assistive reading

441
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:17,159
yeah yeah that's cool yeah that's that's

442
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,720
definitely beyond beyond us for today

443
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,919
okay

444
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,078
so I did I did not want to segue into an

445
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,740
overview of various breeding techniques

446
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,740
and strategies

447
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,619
um

448
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,360
and I think to begin this section the

449
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,279
two really really important questions

450
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,219
that I think both of you could help

451
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,558
expand on is number one what material

452
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,900
are you actually starting with and

453
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,440
number two what are your breeding goals

454
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,440
yes

455
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,678
you had yeah you had quite a bit I think

456
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,480
you know you and you and local and

457
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,280
myself had a little discussion yesterday

458
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,140
about this and

459
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,440
you know what do you think it takes to

460
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,980
actually know what you are starting with

461
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,980
you know

462
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,119
this has been like the the drum I've

463
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,798
been beating as and probably you know

464
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,779
like I get I get a lot of comments about

465
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,359
me being the strained police or genetic

466
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,279
police or you know like the fun police

467
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,319
when it comes to cannabis strains why

468
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,839
you take that so serious who cares it's

469
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,700
dank who cares it just smell good but

470
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,619
the problem is like for breeders if you

471
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,240
don't know what you're working with and

472
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,379
you don't have a firm grip on the

473
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,400
history

474
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,799
um

475
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,538
for example you go buy your first pack

476
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,099
of seeds or not even your first pack you

477
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:36,480
just go buy a pack of seeds from someone

478
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,699
you don't really know that much about

479
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,960
but you've seen their stuff advertised

480
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
in High Times right

481
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,860
right you take it home you go make

482
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,660
crosses with it and you find out five

483
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,678
years later that this was actually

484
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,100
bought

485
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:52,019
from Spain and was a bulk purchase and

486
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,058
it's just some random maybe OG

487
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,220
crisscross made in Spain that was

488
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,619
relabeled as something else so at this

489
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,019
point you've been selling seeds or

490
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:02,819
passing out seeds with

491
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,500
God knows what genetics listed as

492
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,839
something and now your name's tied to it

493
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,980
at that point do you

494
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,939
what do you do like I so all this data

495
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,360
you've been

496
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,100
bringing in like okay I'm seeing this in

497
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,779
my head this is what it is I'm seeing

498
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,159
this expression it must be from this

499
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,779
parent I'm seeing this expression it

500
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,700
must be from this parent and you start

501
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:25,379
adding this data into your data Bank in

502
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,759
your brain and you start growing more

503
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,980
strains and now you're making more

504
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,660
conclusions based off that first grow on

505
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,319
what you grew because you're assuming

506
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,940
that it was correct so it so many things

507
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,720
happen from this

508
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,558
um

509
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,019
how do you properly sort through and get

510
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,418
good starting material to work with

511
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,099
that is such a complex process and it's

512
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,020
really a personal journey and it took me

513
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,619
over a decade to really feel confident

514
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:54,058
about who I was buying seats from or who

515
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:57,359
I was getting seats from in the first

516
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:59,759
place and it really boiled down to

517
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,859
knowing your breeder asking your breeder

518
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,740
questions being very competent learning

519
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,839
myself about breeding and and asking

520
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,880
them hard questions about not even

521
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,879
necessarily hard but Earnest questions

522
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,100
about their process of making the seeds

523
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,960
where they Source the cut you know

524
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,298
sometimes talk to the person they Source

525
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,058
the cut from this is all super important

526
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:24,538
and if you really really want to do

527
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,619
breeding breeding starting material and

528
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:27,660
being confident in your starting

529
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,459
material is as important as anything

530
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,440
else and it's really hard to illustrate

531
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,720
that until someone's further in the

532
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,320
breeding career and they have to go back

533
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,419
and see how accurate their [ __ ] was and

534
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,918
almost no one can nail it in the first

535
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,380
few rounds because of all the

536
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,140
misinformation in cannabis and the the

537
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,960
smoke and mirrors and all that so it's

538
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,400
an overlooked Mega important part of the

539
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,860
breeding process and I can't tell you

540
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,360
how many times people message like me or

541
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,678
one of the other breeders it'll be like

542
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,058
yeah

543
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,900
my

544
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,980
like XYZ some some brand new guy that we

545
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,980
know has never sourced anything

546
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,538
correctly cross to DNA genetics whatever

547
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,279
you know like and they want us to be

548
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:10,019
jazzed about it with them and like at

549
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,700
the same time I know where those guys

550
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,038
Source their stuff and I know there's no

551
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,080
way what he thinks he has he has

552
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,900
so that's an impression he's now left on

553
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,099
me that this person really didn't do

554
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,660
their research from the beginning and

555
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,480
they're already making and selling seeds

556
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,220
so there there's a lot to it how your

557
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,200
relationships form in this in this

558
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,400
industry to to learn from people and to

559
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,880
be mentored

560
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,460
can be affected by your choice and

561
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,080
research ability and what you start with

562
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,779
and where you end up and the conclusions

563
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:42,658
you draw from from said data

564
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,759
um most importantly in my opinion is is

565
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,559
why it's so important to do that

566
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,140
research initially

567
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,639
yeah because I mean you if you don't

568
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,919
have a good starting point it's going to

569
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,500
affect all your Downstream you know

570
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,419
actions and and results there's there's

571
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,480
several years of projects that I've done

572
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,759
that I look back on even even like seven

573
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,759
eight nine years into my career

574
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,339
that I look back on now

575
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,558
and it's embarrassing because some of

576
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,959
them were obviously so off

577
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,460
from what I thought they would be

578
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,579
as far as

579
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,620
their part in history

580
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,939
um or what what was actually in them and

581
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,019
then I go and use them because I think

582
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,720
they're dank

583
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,639
and I trust the breeder

584
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,960
but that doesn't always turn out correct

585
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,460
and

586
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,860
there I could think of several examples

587
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,840
where I look goofy as [ __ ] you know like

588
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,459
like looking back I judge myself as

589
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,779
being very goofy for not having done the

590
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,319
proper research and taking someone's

591
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,319
work so

592
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,319
anything you want to add to that local

593
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,798
yeah

594
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:49,558
um so I mean obviously provenance is you

595
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:53,038
know very very important because

596
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:56,579
um you know we we do have to

597
00:22:53,038 --> 00:23:00,480
you know take into consideration ethics

598
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:03,418
um you know like is science you know

599
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,700
obviously like one of the

600
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,759
you know

601
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,220
I guess um key points of it is

602
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,679
to make sure you have ethical data you

603
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,140
know if it's not you know is it really

604
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,919
valid yes

605
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,400
um

606
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,280
but on top of that I'll also add

607
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,100
um you know it this isn't something that

608
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,859
you can just like Dive Right into and

609
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,839
start reading from the get-go

610
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,579
um you have to learn your parent

611
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,678
material like

612
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:37,199
you know what I mean like it's not like

613
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,860
you can just make a cross I mean you can

614
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,460
but is that actually like reading yeah

615
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,979
is that breeding no yeah exactly it does

616
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,740
take many cycles to learn a parent

617
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,500
because it's not simply growing a dank

618
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,599
you know while that is one aspect of it

619
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,419
you kind of want to see how it Expresses

620
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,240
in multiple different kinds of grows

621
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:03,059
because then you can kind of gauge what

622
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,740
those progenies May Express

623
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:07,079
you know if it's leaning towards that

624
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,058
parent if that makes sense you can make

625
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,359
a much better educated guess that way

626
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:15,178
for sure and and educated guesses in in

627
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,759
breeding like in your first the first

628
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,038
pairing educated guesses are a lot of

629
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,779
where we all start because before seeing

630
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,019
the progeny that's what you have is

631
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:27,980
educated theories or guesswork based on

632
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,980
observations

633
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:35,339
um I will add too that um I know we did

634
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,100
breeding goals and and uh something else

635
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:41,220
as an episode before but I really felt

636
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:42,599
like it kind of got confused between

637
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,240
um what I was talking about with

638
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:48,058
breeding and what breeding is and and

639
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,919
with uh I think it was not so on that

640
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:51,658
one saying that you know like breeding

641
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,200
is just crossing two things and seeing

642
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:57,360
what happens I I I really firmly believe

643
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,538
that breeding is goal oriented and only

644
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,339
goal oriented and that making things to

645
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,019
see what happens yes that's a part of

646
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:06,298
learning if that is not a part

647
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:09,000
necessarily of greedy the actual

648
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,740
breeding process proper so I wanted to

649
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,480
clarify that and I thought we could go

650
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,919
much deeper into the actual breeding as

651
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,740
opposed to just

652
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,520
repeating the crossing see what happens

653
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,140
there yeah yeah and I think the only

654
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,819
other point I wanted to add or it's

655
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,100
maybe a paraphrase of what both of you

656
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,859
have said but

657
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:30,778
um because there's a distinct lack of

658
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,359
good information on provenance and

659
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,980
history often you do have to treat your

660
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,899
starting material like it's just a black

661
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,880
box to begin

662
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,980
right and so

663
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,299
whether it is

664
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,798
um like local Sid whether you're

665
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:46,679
starting with parent material and you're

666
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,538
needing to grow them out in in various

667
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,059
ways in various environments to kind of

668
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:54,000
really see what they do

669
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:55,558
um because or you're actually having to

670
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,579
run out progeny

671
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,298
to see the kinds of ratios you might get

672
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,339
um

673
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,500
in the phenotypes

674
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:07,798
um to see if you can like

675
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,179
almost uh backwards to juice

676
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:10,619
um

677
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,600
more information about the parents

678
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,219
that's really hard to do without the

679
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,278
experience and I talk in other episodes

680
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,079
like thousands of plants right yeah I

681
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,240
talk about a lot about learning the bass

682
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,839
lines be it Northern Lights skunk one

683
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,460
Haze uh different Africans like swazi uh

684
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,500
Durban things like that the bass lines

685
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,259
and the reason I say that is for the

686
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,240
people who want it backwards to Deuce

687
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,339
um like what possible parentage may be

688
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,259
learning those bass lines is one of the

689
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,699
most important things in being able to

690
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,519
do all that and that's one thing Neville

691
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,038
taught me early on as well as

692
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,960
um Hogg James hogtop be the same thing

693
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,000
learn the bass lines it's super

694
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,038
important if you if you want to be

695
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,380
serious about breeding know those lines

696
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,960
so I wanted to add that in too because

697
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,340
there's no reason like when you're

698
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,778
starting breeding there's no reason not

699
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,459
to learn those because they are so

700
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:02,778
important and they are the makeup of

701
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,778
like 90 of what we have out

702
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,179
yeah so I guess what we've really been

703
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,159
addressing

704
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,600
um in this section so far

705
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,940
is the information space and

706
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,699
the kind of tactics that you need to

707
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,600
employ to get as much information as

708
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,200
possible

709
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,639
and and I will I will also add that like

710
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,819
if people are having trouble doing the

711
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,259
research we do have our patreon Discord

712
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,798
um for breeder Syndicate and that's like

713
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:35,759
what we do 24 7 is

714
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:37,798
um talk about genetics history research

715
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,900
how to do this research how to apply the

716
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,220
research all that stuff so there are

717
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,900
there are much better resources than

718
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,360
there were at one time

719
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,500
instead of just saying like go do your

720
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,000
research we're actually trying to

721
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,859
provide a platform for people to do

722
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,099
their research too

723
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:54,719
absolutely thank you thousand because uh

724
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,459
you know we have our codex we're working

725
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,019
on with the strain base as well because

726
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,179
we want to provide a very accurate

727
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,819
stream base that is not a Wiki where

728
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,798
everybody can add to it and add whatever

729
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:06,778
goofiness they want

730
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639
um and and we're working on that and

731
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:10,259
thousands put a lot of hours into into

732
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,299
doing this so I'm really stoked for

733
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,900
everybody to check it out

734
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:19,619
oh yeah I'm super hyped about that yeah

735
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,960
okay well coming back to where we are we

736
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:24,178
just talked a bit about how you know

737
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,460
what material you're starting with and

738
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:29,278
some allusion to breeding goals based on

739
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,798
the knowledge that you have of what

740
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:34,319
you're starting with so

741
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,139
I wanted to divide the rest of this

742
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,819
section into two broad

743
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,860
categories

744
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:44,939
because sometimes your starting point is

745
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:48,240
um

746
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,640
already a couple of individuals perhaps

747
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,319
that you're trying to who's traits

748
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,080
you're trying to narrow down and lock in

749
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,759
other times you might be starting with a

750
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,980
pool of material

751
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,480
in which you are wanted to perform a

752
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,179
search or maybe you're wanting to build

753
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,579
that pool or variability in which to do

754
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:08,038
the search so I think I wanted to begin

755
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,658
with that side where you are I guess an

756
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,879
analogy for this is that you're you're

757
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,140
widening right so there's widening and

758
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,820
then there's narrowing and I think

759
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,278
breathing is this interplay of like

760
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:19,379
widening possibilities and narrowing

761
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,058
possibilities absolutely so in terms of

762
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,220
the widening I I guess one

763
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:26,398
characterization of it is like breeding

764
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,140
to explore and preserve and expand

765
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,219
variability

766
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,720
okay

767
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,558
um is there anything you guys wanted to

768
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,960
say just on that note of like breathing

769
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,119
to widen to begin with

770
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,579
are we still in the the part where we

771
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,079
just say little bits yeah

772
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,119
okay

773
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,579
um well the one thing I'll say is that

774
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,319
cannabis itself for the most part is a

775
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,199
very wide variable

776
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,119
plant and I mean like a lot of people

777
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,740
talk about oh that's just so

778
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,839
bottlenecked and inbred there are very

779
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,579
few things I can I can reference in my

780
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,319
brain that have been hardcore

781
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,178
bottlenecked other than things like you

782
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,740
know cookies has been shown to starting

783
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,140
to be bottlenecked genetically and

784
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,480
that's why we're seeing like mostly one

785
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,059
expression come out of all these you

786
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,179
know different gelato crosses

787
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,139
um or gelato selfs I should say

788
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,880
um

789
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,259
but yeah it's already a very variable

790
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,399
gene pool so a lot of people talk about

791
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:26,519
bottlenecking and it's less of a concern

792
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,259
overall than most people think as far as

793
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,839
like uh it might not be variable enough

794
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,158
it's cannabis is pretty freaking

795
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,319
variable and most people are breeding

796
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,419
with poly hybrids so

797
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,579
um it's not as much of a concern as most

798
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,860
people make it out to be

799
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,658
I agree so I think this this section for

800
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:44,939
us is kind of more of an academic

801
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,559
approach where we're just gonna you know

802
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,538
we'll we'll kind of

803
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,119
um

804
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,500
artificially or not just assume that for

805
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,439
whatever reason someone does want to

806
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,058
increase variable okay and if they did

807
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,798
you know what what are some of the

808
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:01,619
techniques that they could employ

809
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,538
I mean obviously you have something like

810
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,879
um the concept of open pollination which

811
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:08,099
is uh largely known as a conservation

812
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,980
preservation technique

813
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,538
um would you guys see that as one of the

814
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,460
techniques of actually increasing

815
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,440
variability

816
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,640
or not go ahead local local had a good

817
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,259
answer on this and we were talking about

818
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,299
it

819
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,819
um so

820
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,538
open pollination

821
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,298
um

822
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,339
I feel like it's really only ideal like

823
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:31,319
as you were saying thousand kind of in a

824
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:33,119
preservation conservation type of

825
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,319
scenario

826
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:38,339
um

827
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:40,319
you know I think cannabis is a crop that

828
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,898
you know has to kind of be like

829
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,879
directionally selected for at this point

830
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:46,678
you know because if you keep open

831
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,380
pollinating something you're just gonna

832
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,220
lose traits you know

833
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,240
um

834
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,579
by diluting them into you know instead

835
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,500
of making it a one to ten chance of

836
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,898
finding this Fina you might change that

837
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,480
into like one to two hundred or one to

838
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:06,778
100 or something one to ten thousand in

839
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,380
some cases you know yeah

840
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:09,480
um

841
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:14,640
so I think that's really one of the

842
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:18,899
biggest drawbacks to open pollination

843
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:22,799
um you know an alternative could be like

844
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:25,319
um a quote-unquote uh selective uh type

845
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,139
open pollination where you you select a

846
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,500
handful of males on a handful of females

847
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,759
or all the females or whatever you know

848
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,278
um

849
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,278
just because you're kind of weeding out

850
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,558
anything that and again this is all

851
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,500
subjective and all personal because

852
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,139
you're the person making selection

853
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,179
so you know obviously there's that

854
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,880
pressure

855
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,080
um so I mean really at the end of it

856
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,240
it's just

857
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,398
you know growing the progeny out because

858
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,960
you won't know if you expanded that gene

859
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,839
pool until

860
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,419
you actually see what it spit out

861
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:06,119
yeah and again you get back into the the

862
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,679
ability or maybe even accidental by

863
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,379
selecting one trait you've removed the

864
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,120
trait that you want you know like and

865
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,760
you know and this can be done in open

866
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,739
pollination you know or it could be you

867
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,319
could actually screw it up by doing just

868
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,700
a little bit of selection by ah you know

869
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:22,079
this one harms a little bit let's take

870
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,519
that one out and leave the rest of these

871
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,319
for the open pollination but that one

872
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,240
that hurts maybe the one that had skunk

873
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,278
traits that you were looking for and you

874
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,079
just yanked it because it hurt or didn't

875
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,079
grow fast enough for you you know

876
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,480
um yeah this was a good one because you

877
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:38,699
guys actually answered one of the

878
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,278
questions we had which is from e

879
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,100
um who did want to hear about in his

880
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,019
words not a full op but

881
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:49,259
um using multiple choice females and

882
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,679
males um as your base stock so so you

883
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,819
mean CSI discussed a lot of that when we

884
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,500
were doing the Northern Lights

885
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,778
reproduction

886
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,538
what do we leave in and what do we leave

887
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:02,819
out do we want to take out some of the

888
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,798
stuff that we are pretty sure is it nice

889
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,599
growing or

890
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,039
Maybe

891
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,480
you know just different things that we

892
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,239
were seeing in it like we were trying to

893
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,519
figure out do we even touch this do we

894
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,678
put our imprints on it and I think in

895
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,239
the end we decided to go with not I

896
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,320
think we in the end we decided to go

897
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,539
with

898
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,280
um just not touching it because it

899
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,800
wasn't ours we felt like it wasn't ours

900
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,659
to touch in the first place like that

901
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,879
um and people wanted nl5 and a pure open

902
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,099
pollination and at that point no one had

903
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:34,319
done you know at least a 50 seed plus

904
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,760
Pop to make those so we wanted instead

905
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,580
of you know the 10 seed pop that was

906
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,540
being sold we wanted to organize 50c

907
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:42,418
look through because that's what we had

908
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:47,000
or we would have done more

909
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:47,000
yeah yep very good example

910
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:53,460
um yeah was anything else to add to this

911
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,319
idea of like open or maybe for like

912
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,320
where the term semi-open pollination

913
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,660
okay um another good example might be

914
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,420
skunk one

915
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,460
um skunk one was said to be skunky when

916
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,800
it came out and Sam the skunk man

917
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,539
himself says he did not do anything but

918
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,619
open successive open pollinations on

919
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:12,779
skunk one

920
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,519
and most of us are familiar with skunk

921
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,099
one now and what you're not going to

922
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,019
find is skunkiness in Skunk one you'll

923
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,559
find anything but that

924
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,960
um

925
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,159
he says he intentionally bred out the

926
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,900
skunkiness

927
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,578
but if he's intentionally breeding it

928
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,200
out through open pollinations where he's

929
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,660
not selecting anything I'm not sure how

930
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,578
that was achieved intentionally

931
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:34,639
but it may be what local is talking

932
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,740
about successive open pollinations

933
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,500
accidentally removing a trait

934
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:44,279
I think that I assume also that that

935
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,960
that approach uh probably sums up a lot

936
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,220
of traditional

937
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,619
um

938
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:51,618
you know uh cannabis plant reading in

939
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,098
in various like indigenous cultures

940
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,500
right it's a kind of like semi-open

941
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,180
every year they choose the best

942
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,338
and yeah they check them all in for the

943
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:03,539
next year yeah it's mostly semi-open

944
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,799
correct

945
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,539
okay okay

946
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,039
um

947
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:10,440
one thing I'll add

948
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,659
um is in kind of um you know

949
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,599
conservation population genetics there's

950
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:18,059
this term called the founder effect and

951
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,380
that is pretty much gonna be you know

952
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:24,420
the individuals and the frequency and

953
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,920
distribution of alleles you know in that

954
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,980
population

955
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,500
you know those are the founding

956
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:35,039
genetic you know

957
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,519
material donors so you know what you

958
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,699
have and if that you know frequency for

959
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,579
that certain trait isn't that common

960
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,439
then you know that specific fragment

961
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:49,920
that you're working with you may have

962
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,838
possibly isolated you know that trait um

963
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
yeah out

964
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,960
yeah

965
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,639
yeah and I've always wondered if that

966
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,780
happened with Haze or you know like

967
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,539
there's a lot of them I wonder if that

968
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,079
happens with it yeah and sadly you know

969
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:06,539
this isn't this right here is more so a

970
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,359
this is an actual game of chance you

971
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:12,059
know what I mean oh yeah

972
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:15,119
so that's one thing to add to that

973
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:17,219
specific type system oh yeah you're

974
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,380
gonna predict what phenos the seed's

975
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:22,039
gonna throw out by looking at the seed

976
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,440
yeah right

977
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,699
absolutely absolutely this you know

978
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,099
breeding

979
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,960
is a game of odds right it's it's a game

980
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:34,440
with like frequencies statistical

981
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,740
probabilities yeah absolutely

982
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,200
um okay well the other point I wanted to

983
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:42,659
move on to within this section of like

984
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,939
exploring uh

985
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:47,098
uh preserving expanding variability we

986
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,760
have of course outcrossing outbreeding

987
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,760
hybridization

988
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,780
now I was just curious like on this one

989
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,460
I mean there's not a lot to say about it

990
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,780
I think everyone understands what what

991
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,800
this is

992
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,140
um

993
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,599
how often would you

994
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:05,279
outcross just from the just from the

995
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,800
get-go

996
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,940
like under what circumstances would you

997
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,440
just be like Oh I'm starting with this

998
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,720
but you know I'm just gonna immediately

999
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,639
like cross it to something else

1000
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,439
so a lot of the times when I like

1001
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,879
thinking back to my career most of the

1002
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,559
times when I would be out Crossing it

1003
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,720
was because I had a clone only selection

1004
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,759
and I didn't want to necessarily

1005
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:26,279
feminize it because that plant won't

1006
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,140
reverse well or for whatever reason I

1007
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,099
may be doing working on another reversal

1008
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,078
project

1009
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,660
but I also like working with males a lot

1010
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,480
I really do because I think there's it's

1011
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:38,578
it is harder in a sense that the mail

1012
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,260
isn't necessarily showing the visual

1013
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:42,240
traits it's always going to breed

1014
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,740
whereas females they don't necessarily

1015
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,098
do that either but you get a much better

1016
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:49,019
idea of their their resin production the

1017
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,880
kind of sense in that particular

1018
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,619
expression so you know what to look for

1019
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,900
on and on you know what I mean but with

1020
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,338
males it is it is tends to be more of an

1021
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,680
art form

1022
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:00,000
um in what you do

1023
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,519
I don't know

1024
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,739
so I guess like uh one way I could look

1025
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,380
at what you just said is

1026
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,358
um you can sometimes hybridize uh uh to

1027
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,300
actually get more information obviously

1028
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,799
right like in the crosses you'll you'll

1029
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,300
start to see like what's actually being

1030
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,700
passed and like you said if you've got

1031
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,440
males that's one of the only ways you

1032
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:23,159
can know and the other thing is

1033
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,079
obviously if one one strain has one or a

1034
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,639
few or one desirable trait that you like

1035
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,079
in the in another strain has other

1036
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,819
desirable traits you like and you want

1037
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,560
them both to be in a single strain

1038
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,300
that's the other purpose for

1039
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,139
hybridization that's the main purpose I

1040
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,039
would say

1041
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:39,480
yeah yeah that makes sense

1042
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,559
um local anything you want to add to

1043
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,199
that breeding yeah so the hybridization

1044
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:49,980
part I mean it's

1045
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:52,500
you know if you kind of know like the

1046
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,679
parent material you know and you you

1047
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,920
know whatever you popped a few and you

1048
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,899
can see it's relatively kind of

1049
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,079
um I guess this is obviously a

1050
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,559
hypothetical situation but you see that

1051
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,140
it's uh rather um IBL you know I don't

1052
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:12,900
think the smartest decision would be to

1053
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,699
you know read it with itself again

1054
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,639
that's obviously like kind of a case

1055
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:19,980
where you want to hybridize so that you

1056
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:24,000
don't lose some of that blueberry

1057
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:27,539
eventually again yeah yeah

1058
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,039
really good point yep really nice points

1059
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:29,880
okay

1060
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:31,858
um

1061
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,838
I hadn't I had a question here which I

1062
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:34,920
wasn't very sure of and I didn't I

1063
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,259
didn't really understand how to approach

1064
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,180
it so I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys

1065
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,300
have a go at it but

1066
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:45,358
in terms of variability

1067
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,060
um and having a pull to search through

1068
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,460
are there techniques that allow you to

1069
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:53,338
dig into recessives

1070
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,838
more than otherwise

1071
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:56,279
yeah obviously we're going to get

1072
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:58,380
resistance coming through you know it's

1073
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,140
cannabis we already mentioned you've

1074
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,280
heterozygosity kind of pervasive so

1075
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,739
you're it's not like you're not going to

1076
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,380
see recessives in any generation but are

1077
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:10,078
there have y'all like experienced

1078
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,820
actually looking for recessives

1079
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,280
um did I just hear a New Zealander say

1080
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,500
y'all

1081
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,519
I do say y'all I'm a weirdo that's

1082
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,880
beautiful

1083
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:23,159
um no yeah I mean otherwise

1084
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,039
use

1085
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,679
oh use like use guys

1086
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:29,460
you guys yeah

1087
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,858
yeah

1088
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,858
um s1s s1s are the one of my favorite

1089
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:37,920
places to see recesses and um and and

1090
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:39,420
outliers like specifically selfing is

1091
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,519
one of the quickest ways to see outlier

1092
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,380
in my opinion

1093
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,539
that's a funny thing about selfing hey

1094
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,980
because on the one hand you obviously

1095
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:48,960
it's a good tool for locking things in

1096
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,280
or narrowing but on the other hand I

1097
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,980
guess there's an element of it where you

1098
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,960
also will find weird stuff so it's

1099
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,219
double-edged sword a lot of us refer to

1100
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,079
it as a double-edged sword because

1101
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,719
you're going to see high ceiling low

1102
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,220
floor and a lot of s1s

1103
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,379
that's right and we'll get we'll come

1104
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,000
back to uh solving again in the

1105
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,280
narrowing section

1106
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,559
but yeah local anything on recessives

1107
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,560
and like looking at like

1108
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,139
looking for recessive traits and stuff

1109
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,078
um I mean I would just add on to the S1

1110
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:20,940
I feel like it's the most effective way

1111
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,460
to actually lock in any sort of

1112
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,720
recessives and um you know one thing

1113
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,059
that I've seen

1114
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:31,219
you know rather recently you know for

1115
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:34,500
example bitter did the S1 F2 of the p91

1116
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:37,799
yeah and it's like that in itself I feel

1117
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,320
is like is isolating you know recessive

1118
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,599
traits or maybe not even recessive but

1119
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,440
desirable traits within a selective

1120
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,180
selected phenome yeah oh yeah and people

1121
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,220
are going to want to hear about that

1122
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,019
again I think when we get to the locking

1123
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,598
in section

1124
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,219
okay so I had a I had a random one just

1125
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,480
to kind of tie this this section up

1126
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,219
because I don't know much about it

1127
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,599
myself

1128
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,338
um I'm not even sure if it necessarily

1129
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,859
fits in here but [ __ ] it we're gonna ask

1130
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:07,799
it anyway yeah try cheese cheese wants

1131
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:10,219
to know about employee manipulations

1132
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,480
uh like the culture scene and

1133
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:14,338
that's that I don't think that fits in

1134
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,480
any of these scenarios people

1135
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:18,480
manipulating

1136
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,358
yeah with fluidism with with do you have

1137
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,559
anything there local yeah so I was gonna

1138
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,719
say

1139
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,699
um you know really the only way we can

1140
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,379
[ __ ] around with it is by you know

1141
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:31,618
treating it with you know harsh

1142
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,318
chemicals to induce that mutation

1143
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:37,019
um but I will say that it isn't uncommon

1144
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,119
for certain species to express Express

1145
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:42,059
different employee levels depending on

1146
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,619
like elevation or whatever whatever it

1147
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:45,779
may be

1148
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:47,519
um so you know I don't want to say it

1149
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,920
does but I also don't want to say it

1150
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,858
doesn't occur in cannabis you know and

1151
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,300
maybe are there are there plodiums that

1152
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,578
you can I mean if that's a correct word

1153
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,980
but are there like polyploids can you

1154
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:02,818
identify them visually

1155
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,740
um so I was actually reading a bit

1156
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:07,380
um because I saw this specific question

1157
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:10,500
and I was like okay you know I have

1158
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,300
worked with um a pi that has studied

1159
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,338
like polyploidism

1160
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,039
um in relation to like environment you

1161
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:18,599
know I mean she works in the Sonora

1162
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,960
Desert so it's going to obviously be

1163
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,579
elevation type based stuff sure

1164
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,679
um and there is some correlation you

1165
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,380
know things that are higher in elevation

1166
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,199
may have more chromosomes or less

1167
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,880
chromosomes depending but can you is

1168
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,219
there anything about ploitism that you

1169
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,019
can like in cannabis that you can say Ah

1170
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:38,699
that's a polyploid visually without

1171
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,539
being tested

1172
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:43,318
um

1173
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:45,300
not 100 but I was reading this paper and

1174
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:48,239
they were saying apparently that there

1175
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,560
are going to be less stomata and larger

1176
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:55,679
stomata per Leaf area that makes so you

1177
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,838
still need a microscope exactly so it's

1178
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,239
not something you can like physically

1179
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,759
see like you kind of have to study it at

1180
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,500
the because I I see that online a lot

1181
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,540
like on Instagram where people be like

1182
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,579
check it out I got a polyploid and like

1183
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,039
they'll show a plant that like has like

1184
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,660
you know weird branching or something

1185
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,818
like you've got a polyploid and it's

1186
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:17,578
like bro yeah yeah you see that with

1187
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:20,579
people who have like uh fasciations as

1188
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:23,700
well yes yeah yeah it's like no those

1189
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,440
those don't necessarily reduce to Pilot

1190
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:27,838
points yeah that's not correlated to

1191
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,179
polyploidism no

1192
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,920
yeah yeah because I I guess polyploid is

1193
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:37,618
specifically like a chromosomal

1194
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,220
thing right like it's not that's what it

1195
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:43,318
actually corresponds to yes yeah

1196
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:45,358
okay that's cool and that was just kind

1197
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,980
of a fun one to check in there I just

1198
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,619
wanted to correct that it's polyploidy

1199
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,139
not polyploidism I just remember yeah

1200
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,780
that makes sense

1201
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:57,299
it's kind of an ugly word yeah anyway I

1202
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,180
blame the word

1203
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:03,000
yeah last minute where it's just yeah

1204
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:04,940
anyway okay so now we move on to what I

1205
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,318
think most people think of as breeding

1206
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,179
where you are trying well that's not

1207
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,460
true but anyway uh breeding to narrow

1208
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:15,059
down and lock in

1209
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,679
yes and I guess the easiest or most

1210
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,019
straightforward one to begin with maybe

1211
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,818
is like regular Philly or breeding right

1212
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:23,818
so siblings have the same progeny lot

1213
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:25,139
generation intimated to produce new

1214
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:26,880
generations

1215
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:29,039
and this is where I guess you can kind

1216
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,920
of see like recurrent selections

1217
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,318
um

1218
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,579
uh in in successive Generations

1219
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:36,779
um

1220
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,460
yeah

1221
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,519
would either of you'd like to kick us

1222
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,940
off on like just this this method in

1223
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,159
general for trying to preserve something

1224
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,380
go ahead local good luck lock something

1225
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,420
in I should say

1226
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,460
um so obviously we're gonna start with

1227
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,180
our seed pop right

1228
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,559
um

1229
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:58,739
so

1230
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:02,578
this is something that's you know very

1231
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,959
goal oriented you you kind of have to

1232
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,380
have a goal

1233
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:11,699
to make things and move things forward

1234
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:14,700
so so you want to make sure that

1235
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:17,279
you have an idea where you want to go

1236
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,739
and you want to make sure that you can

1237
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,800
identify these traits

1238
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:23,939
and move those traits forward by you

1239
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,099
know

1240
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,039
in this case we're working with the

1241
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:32,338
regular population you know and this may

1242
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:36,179
be one way to do it but it isn't an

1243
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:40,400
answer and you know some people may look

1244
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:42,960
for male plants that do look you know

1245
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,358
morphologically similar to a female

1246
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,519
counterpart you know and maybe you'd

1247
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,739
cross those two together and hope that

1248
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:53,219
those progeny are going to be consistent

1249
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:56,939
for that morphological you know shape

1250
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:59,699
but also those flower morphology traits

1251
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,818
you know because yeah we do smoked flour

1252
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:05,818
and we don't grow it specifically you

1253
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:08,279
know for shape yeah but

1254
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:10,259
you know that's kind of one way you

1255
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,720
could maybe approach that

1256
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:16,619
um or it maybe you can

1257
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:19,139
um cross you know one narrow one broad

1258
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,260
you know and see what comes out of that

1259
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:24,480
and try to find something in between you

1260
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,920
know it it depends the goal really and

1261
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,838
yeah and that would be you know in that

1262
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,039
scenario their goal would be uh

1263
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,078
something that looks quote unquote

1264
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,619
hybrid that would be the goal right like

1265
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:36,780
with the that case yeah for sure

1266
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:39,119
I kind of did want to ask here because I

1267
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,300
don't know about this much myself but

1268
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,880
what's the within filial breeding and

1269
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,099
generational kind of um moving things

1270
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,858
forward what is the difference between

1271
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,318
picking like one male and one female for

1272
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:54,838
each generation and picking like a few

1273
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,000
of each in each generation

1274
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,519
and when would you kind of go with one

1275
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,679
as opposed to the other

1276
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,519
okay so for me

1277
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,559
I don't like to do multiple pairings and

1278
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,139
then mixing the seeds I don't mind doing

1279
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:12,358
multiple pairings and keeping the seeds

1280
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:14,818
segregated so I know what each parent is

1281
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:16,739
offering but like in many situations

1282
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,358
when I see people doing

1283
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:20,219
um like multiple females and multiple

1284
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:21,838
males what they'll do is do the cross

1285
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:25,019
and then combine all the seeds and call

1286
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:28,199
it all one thing and to me like that's

1287
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:29,699
fine but I wouldn't do it because like

1288
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,078
each one of those different parents is

1289
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:32,219
going to be taking it in a slightly

1290
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,859
different Direction with different

1291
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,659
traits combining it all together would

1292
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,420
be calling this oh this is that line but

1293
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:41,358
I like in my case because I sell seeds I

1294
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,760
like my customers to know what to expect

1295
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,559
and in order to be very precise with

1296
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,000
that it to me it should always be

1297
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,559
one-to-one pairings but there's people

1298
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,960
who disagree with me on this it really

1299
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,578
is just a philosophical kind of

1300
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,358
standpoint for a lot of breeders where

1301
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,359
they stand on that

1302
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:59,639
yeah I think that's why it's such an

1303
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:02,039
interesting question because there's no

1304
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:04,739
right answer here um absolutely we're

1305
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:05,420
looking at this at trade-offs

1306
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,338
um

1307
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:10,200
on this like I guess this is like the

1308
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,578
difference between like mess I don't

1309
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,919
know what the right term is mass or

1310
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:17,000
group selection in Philly or breeding

1311
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,000
versus one-to-one

1312
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,720
um so let's say you're in average

1313
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,460
um seed buyer right

1314
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,098
and you know you're getting maybe one to

1315
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:32,099
two packs of something maybe that first

1316
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:35,160
poll You're Gonna Wanna Do a you know

1317
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:37,680
not an open pollination but like a some

1318
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,318
kind of selective open pollination so

1319
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:42,659
you can search through more if you

1320
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:45,239
genuinely have intentions of searching

1321
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:46,379
for something in that line yeah

1322
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:48,239
um

1323
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,619
so

1324
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,679
you know

1325
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,680
um

1326
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,939
what was the question again [ __ ]

1327
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,199
I guess like the difference between one

1328
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,358
to one

1329
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:02,239
filial breeding where you choose one

1330
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:04,920
male and one female

1331
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,419
and choosing multiple males and females

1332
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,380
per generation

1333
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:12,780
to step forward so when you want to open

1334
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:16,260
that pool up that's when you'd maybe

1335
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:19,200
want to use uh more broader pool of

1336
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,780
individuals but kind of you know me

1337
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,818
after the F2 I feel like I would kind of

1338
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,339
just take it one direction or the other

1339
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:29,279
and nothing really in between

1340
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:31,259
because then like what's the point of

1341
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,940
searching through an F3 finding

1342
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,579
something two things that are polar

1343
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,318
opposite and then keep Crossing them you

1344
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:39,960
know okay I have a further prompt here

1345
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:41,460
like what about the situation where you

1346
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,500
are choosing multiples but you're

1347
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,500
choosing them for very similar traits

1348
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,079
they just wouldn't see the point

1349
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,460
I would just I would just take clones of

1350
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,720
one you know and just fill it through

1351
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,480
them with clones of one as opposed to

1352
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,179
multiple so this is kind of something

1353
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,579
that I find it's um I don't want to say

1354
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:06,899
it's relevant but kind of relevant to my

1355
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:08,818
current situation is I'm growing the um

1356
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,880
Electric Boogaloo across to the

1357
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,739
Appalachia Appalachia Appalachia however

1358
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,760
we want to say it right what's the name

1359
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,519
of that line

1360
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,780
uh good old Mountain Dew good old

1361
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,280
Mountain Dew from high and Lonesome

1362
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,940
that's right

1363
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,160
um but you know it's interesting because

1364
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,920
there seems to be three you know what

1365
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:32,219
we'll call frequencies you know things

1366
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,980
that are obviously very sativa you know

1367
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:37,139
things that are somewhat you know sativa

1368
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,900
but didn't stretch as much as the things

1369
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:41,098
that were obviously very sativa and then

1370
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,079
there are these plants that didn't

1371
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,780
stretch whatsoever

1372
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,180
so now the way that I'm kind of looking

1373
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,940
at it is you kind of have these three

1374
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,980
types but you have to find that

1375
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,400
individual within those

1376
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:59,719
types essentially you know yeah kind of

1377
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:04,318
fulfill that purpose you know so it's

1378
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:07,259
you know selecting within isolated you

1379
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:09,179
know fragments within a group if it I

1380
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,339
don't know yeah no it makes sense yeah

1381
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:13,919
very interesting

1382
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:16,858
now that's super cool

1383
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,539
um that's a good good anecdote there

1384
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:19,920
okay

1385
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:22,019
um was there anything else that you two

1386
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,460
wanted to say about regular filial

1387
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:26,519
breeding

1388
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,500
otherwise um it just goes back to again

1389
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,059
knowing your starting material if you're

1390
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,739
going to do affiliate braiding like you

1391
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:34,559
want to know what you're working with

1392
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:36,358
and be sure of what you're working with

1393
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,579
because your filial breeding is a

1394
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:40,558
several year several step long process

1395
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,420
if you want to really like take it

1396
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,519
several Generations in you don't want to

1397
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,900
go spend five years on something and be

1398
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:47,639
disappointed because you found out it

1399
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,099
has you know cropped the [ __ ] in it

1400
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:53,219
or something like that another strain

1401
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:54,180
yep yep and later on we we will we will

1402
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:55,318
I think

1403
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:57,838
um

1404
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:00,420
get to talk about situation situations

1405
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:04,019
in which you should stop or even go back

1406
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,159
but um good deal for now we're going to

1407
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:10,139
move on to a pet topic which is

1408
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:15,920
self-fulfing and using selfing to

1409
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:15,920
narrow down lock-in certain traits

1410
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:19,139
okay

1411
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,598
um

1412
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:22,858
I mean when it comes to selfing there

1413
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,079
are several different methods I think we

1414
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:27,659
talked about some of these last time in

1415
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,640
the last episode did I yeah okay yeah in

1416
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:31,379
terms of techniques yeah techniques yeah

1417
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:33,118
so you can use many of those techniques

1418
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,460
that we refer to any one of them you

1419
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,440
know whatever works best for you some

1420
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,300
people have you know amazing luck with

1421
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,800
colloidal silver I didn't

1422
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,539
um you know

1423
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,859
that's usually the one most people go to

1424
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:47,400
because it sounds the easiest to make

1425
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:49,679
but I highly recommend an STS phase

1426
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,059
um when you do reversals most of the

1427
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,879
time you're going to be narrowing the

1428
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,960
pull much faster actually all the time

1429
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,760
you're going to be narrowing the pool

1430
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,740
much faster in a selfish situation than

1431
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,839
you would be by outcrossing obviously

1432
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:03,358
you're bringing in in an outcross new

1433
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:05,460
genetic material and even if it's a

1434
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,759
filial generation breeding of the same

1435
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,679
line by selfing you're taking it down

1436
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:14,040
it's like almost like a fast forward

1437
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:14,940
Game Genie type jumping through genetic

1438
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:16,739
uh

1439
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,539
I don't know how you'd say that genetic

1440
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,598
segregation well

1441
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:23,358
what's that section medical time

1442
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,800
yeah

1443
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,659
genetic time machine

1444
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,059
um it's also much more predictable right

1445
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:32,338
than filial reading yeah I mean yeah

1446
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:34,440
because it's targeted specific like

1447
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:37,199
faster

1448
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,200
um segregation

1449
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,199
yeah

1450
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,240
and you know going back to the bringing

1451
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,160
bringing back like the what I was

1452
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:48,598
problematizing earlier with Mendel's

1453
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:50,098
science

1454
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,838
um I think that's one of the reasons why

1455
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:53,760
selfing is so big in cannabis right

1456
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,558
because we don't again we don't have

1457
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,079
access to

1458
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,220
um true breeding parents a lot of the

1459
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,480
time

1460
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,799
um we don't have access to True beating

1461
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,280
traits

1462
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,740
um most of the time so selfing is one of

1463
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,500
the ways you can kind of get around the

1464
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,959
lack of predictability there I don't

1465
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,760
think that that is a reason that people

1466
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,639
make Femme seeds I think that is

1467
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,900
probably taken into account by maybe one

1468
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:21,358
percent of the people who make

1469
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:24,599
self-seeds uniformity or what they're

1470
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:26,338
putting out I think mostly that is it's

1471
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:28,140
popular realistically because people

1472
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:29,400
like to save space and don't like Mills

1473
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:31,019
and it's much easier for them not to

1474
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,000
look for males or learn how to select

1475
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:34,739
males so that's tends to be why most

1476
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,659
people make them seeds is because it

1477
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:39,239
sells for that reason not because uh

1478
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:41,759
isolating anything

1479
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,379
yep yep that makes sense but I guess

1480
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,260
like whether they know it or not there

1481
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:51,119
is a distinct Advantage from yes exactly

1482
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,720
yeah yeah yeah okay that's cool

1483
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,000
um

1484
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:55,558
local anything you want to say on just

1485
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
like selfing in general

1486
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,800
um in this context of logging in

1487
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,838
otherwise that we have we have quite a

1488
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,740
good question

1489
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:05,099
um

1490
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:07,679
yeah I mean other than you know it gives

1491
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,539
you the ability to tap into certain you

1492
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,818
know recessives that might be desirable

1493
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:13,858
you know really that that is going to be

1494
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:15,000
the most effective way to achieve it

1495
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:17,400
because

1496
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,800
I guess if you're thinking about it you

1497
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,500
know at a

1498
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,960
um molecular levels you're kind of just

1499
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,059
stacking these things on top of each

1500
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,780
other making the chance of something

1501
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:31,700
popping up significantly higher yeah

1502
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,619
yeah

1503
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:37,199
a good way of putting it

1504
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:39,000
okay so we can move on to in the wins

1505
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,299
question and I think now I look at it uh

1506
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,159
maybe split into two parts first part is

1507
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:50,220
have we seen many S3

1508
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:52,379
like lines

1509
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:54,358
no

1510
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,280
yeah and why is that

1511
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:58,619
because once you start trying to reverse

1512
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,900
at the S2 there tends to be a lot of

1513
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:04,140
issues with reversals it has two that we

1514
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,639
found in S2 populations and I don't we

1515
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:07,920
don't know why necessarily because we're

1516
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:09,299
not like looking at it at the molecular

1517
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,099
level we're actually just looking at it

1518
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,660
from the visual expression level I'm

1519
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:15,539
going God damn it why doesn't this work

1520
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:18,239
but realistically it kind of makes sense

1521
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:20,460
um with a as you dig into the recessives

1522
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,598
more more things are kind of scrambled

1523
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,519
and

1524
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,800
you know like some things don't reverse

1525
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,838
well some things do reverse well and for

1526
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,640
some reason the more you inbreed the

1527
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,318
less likely things are looking to

1528
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,098
reverse well at least with the lines

1529
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:34,099
we've done it with

1530
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,440
yeah that makes sense I mean

1531
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:39,838
um

1532
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,179
as you inbreed further you are

1533
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:43,259
endangering essentially the fitness of

1534
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:45,838
the

1535
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,440
um the material right and and the and

1536
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,440
The Offspring

1537
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,480
yeah and if Auto Zones are controlling

1538
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:52,139
some of this

1539
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,000
um

1540
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:56,639
even though you know AutoZone's with a

1541
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,960
non-sexual chromosomes even though they

1542
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,940
are not sexual they might be helping

1543
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,920
control some of that

1544
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:04,679
so there's a lot

1545
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,298
in in selfieing with the recessives and

1546
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:07,558
that is just there's a lot of

1547
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:09,239
variability a lot of things that could

1548
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:10,680
be controlling it I don't personally

1549
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,479
understand I'm not a scientist and like

1550
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:15,058
I know we said at the beginning but

1551
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,099
again I am far from a scientist I am

1552
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:20,640
very lame in service where's my my buddy

1553
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,798
local here actually went to school you

1554
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,440
know like that's not me so I I may be

1555
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:28,019
using some odd words to people apologies

1556
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,280
to the science Community for destroying

1557
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:31,280
everything I'm saying yeah

1558
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,199
okay

1559
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:35,760
um local anything you want to add to

1560
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:37,259
that otherwise I can move on to the next

1561
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,020
part of the question

1562
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,420
um so yeah so Matt was saying that you

1563
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:46,019
know you're obviously you know stacking

1564
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:50,760
these jeans on top of each other

1565
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:53,818
um so you know it's kind of like fast

1566
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,819
forwarding in genetic time you know a

1567
00:59:53,818 --> 01:00:00,119
few Generations so we know that this

1568
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:02,460
isn't at the extreme of an F2 this is

1569
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,760
you know something more and more

1570
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,920
isolated and so as you isolate these

1571
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,440
things more deleterious alleles have

1572
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,139
higher chances of popping up and you

1573
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,380
know things you know not reversing past

1574
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:18,480
S2 could be just a symptom of inbreeding

1575
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,000
depression you know through Rapid

1576
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,699
breathing and like I said it may be the

1577
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,559
the things we were selecting as well you

1578
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:28,500
know to choose to do I mean maybe if you

1579
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:30,119
chip like uh let's say a super mega poly

1580
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,039
hybrid like animal mints like if you go

1581
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,440
on seed finder for example and look at

1582
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,239
the tree like it's like 90 feet long

1583
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,579
because it's just a bunch of poly hybrid

1584
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,558
stacked on each other maybe in that case

1585
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:42,359
taking that to S2 might have a higher

1586
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,380
chance of reversals because it's just so

1587
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:45,380
many you know

1588
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:51,119
you know and

1589
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:54,298
uh obviously some of these

1590
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,160
um you know depressions you know that we

1591
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:59,639
see aren't always going to be physical

1592
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:02,098
traits you know exactly one of crybaby's

1593
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:04,858
big things are uh plant hormones and

1594
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:07,619
whatnot you know and that can that

1595
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:08,940
obviously has so much to do with why the

1596
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,099
plant does

1597
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,679
pretty much all the [ __ ] it does so like

1598
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,079
yeah it not reversing might just mean

1599
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,399
that it doesn't have the genetic

1600
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,220
capability

1601
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:24,260
to reduce said levels of hormones or

1602
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:24,259
regulate you know that exactly

1603
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:30,059
cool very nice

1604
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:31,618
okay so I'll reframe the next part of in

1605
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:33,000
the wind's question

1606
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,920
um to say

1607
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,858
uh because as as you mentioned now we're

1608
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,380
not we haven't really seen S3s but

1609
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:43,798
have we seen many instances of uh S2s or

1610
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:46,280
s1s being crossed and yes what's the

1611
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:46,280
vibe there

1612
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:51,298
um yeah I know that me and CSI like we

1613
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:55,740
found some of our best stuff in like a

1614
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:58,858
in self-sisters crossed to each other so

1615
01:01:55,739 --> 01:02:01,618
um let's say you pop uh a pack of for

1616
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:04,500
example California Orange s1s we would

1617
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:06,298
take uh one selection that we really

1618
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,159
liked from the California oranges ones

1619
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:09,838
and we find another selection that we

1620
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,539
really like for another reason from the

1621
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,759
California before oranges ones and when

1622
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,980
we cross those we won't necessarily be

1623
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,559
getting what's called an S2 because it's

1624
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:21,539
not it's not necessarily self would be

1625
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,339
using the same exact expression onto

1626
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:25,679
itself but this is two different

1627
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:28,798
expressions from the same line me and

1628
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:30,960
CSI refer to this as an F2 reversal and

1629
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,039
in it's not necessarily the proper

1630
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,720
terminology it's not scientific

1631
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,699
terminology but we needed something to

1632
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:37,259
denote like what we're doing and what

1633
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:37,980
stage we're at and it's not necessarily

1634
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,859
self

1635
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,838
it is technically a filial generation of

1636
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:45,000
sorts and it's a reversal and I like

1637
01:02:42,838 --> 01:02:46,500
denoting reversals so people understand

1638
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,940
that something was reversed in the

1639
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,420
process so that they understand that

1640
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:53,400
it's more narrow as it were than using

1641
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,338
like you know other material outcross

1642
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,139
but in that sense like we are I can

1643
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:00,298
think of so many examples

1644
01:02:58,139 --> 01:03:02,400
um where we're crossing two sisters two

1645
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:04,559
sisters from the same line in a in a

1646
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,760
little generation just brings out

1647
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,339
amazingness

1648
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,619
um a great example would be bitter when

1649
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:12,000
he took my p91 s1s and found two

1650
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:15,358
selections he liked from that and made

1651
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,599
the p91 f2r I believe it's called and it

1652
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,159
it seriously was so much better than the

1653
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:21,599
original starting material it was so

1654
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,078
much better than anything I saw on the

1655
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,480
s1s and um yeah and it's not uncommon

1656
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,960
for that to happen in these uh feminized

1657
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,960
hybrids

1658
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,838
oh go go ahead man no local you do it

1659
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,519
um oh I was just gonna say that it you

1660
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:42,000
know it's pretty cool to kind of grow

1661
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:44,519
those lines out because it kind of like

1662
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,500
how do I say this it locks things in

1663
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:49,798
while opening

1664
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,960
things up in a way yeah it sounds

1665
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:54,239
counter-intuitive but that's almost what

1666
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,639
it does because like the sweet pea for

1667
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,798
example like everything had copious

1668
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,598
amounts of resin like yeah you know

1669
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:04,500
everything

1670
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:07,680
um smells you know two kind of smells I

1671
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,619
guess yeah really yeah soapy and then

1672
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,919
one that was Lee nutty you know exactly

1673
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:17,280
yeah literally so at that point it was

1674
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:20,700
just picking a plant that vibed with you

1675
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,220
really yeah so I I think those are

1676
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:25,078
really fun lines to hunt because you can

1677
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:27,358
kind of um

1678
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:29,818
how do I say this um I don't think

1679
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:33,000
personalize it is is really the way to

1680
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:38,338
put it but kind of adapt it to your your

1681
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,440
environment yeah yeah you know

1682
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:42,719
and then there's also you know like the

1683
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,000
the feminized hybrids where it's not

1684
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,098
sisters and it's two different clones

1685
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,358
Crossing and we've also found amazing

1686
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:49,980
stuff in there

1687
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:52,139
um I tend to like the sister to sister

1688
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,179
more than just the um two different

1689
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:56,338
lines because that is more of a let's

1690
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:57,899
see what happens type scenario for the

1691
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:58,798
most part with the the colonic clones

1692
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,500
but

1693
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,420
um I mean like for that example the the

1694
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,039
uh reverse train wreck onto the Santa

1695
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,539
Cruz blue dream I think that's become

1696
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,880
one of the favorites in our group you

1697
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:11,219
know what I mean like and this is it was

1698
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,798
better than either parent in my opinion

1699
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:16,139
on their own combined it made for

1700
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,519
something better than both parents which

1701
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:19,519
is it's not always common

1702
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:25,259
yep and I guess to bring it back to the

1703
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,619
um this section on like narrowing

1704
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,480
locking in would y'all say that selfing

1705
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,160
and I don't know if I'm wrenching the

1706
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,019
science here but would jail say that

1707
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,598
something

1708
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:37,980
um gives us a a bit of chance of

1709
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,420
actually having something that's true of

1710
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,960
reading

1711
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,960
yes

1712
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,180
yeah

1713
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,420
generally speaking yes

1714
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:49,019
yeah cool yeah

1715
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:53,338
um

1716
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:55,559
okay and maybe the last question uh last

1717
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:57,960
part of this question is and you kind of

1718
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:03,420
alluded to this when you cross

1719
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:06,420
two s ones do you do you expect a

1720
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,400
um a little boost in Vigor all right is

1721
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:11,420
that a way to offset some of this

1722
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,420
inbreeding depression

1723
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:18,240
yes I and I'll say just anecdotally

1724
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:21,118
specifically with the p91 one p91 was

1725
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,558
very very very uh the reason it was

1726
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,660
given to me is because the dude who had

1727
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,700
it the very last cut he was like this is

1728
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:28,739
dying on me and there was no Vigor left

1729
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,358
in it there was really no resin

1730
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:34,159
production left

1731
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:37,440
um it definitely restored Vigor to

1732
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:39,298
an almost obsolete cut so in that sense

1733
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,519
yes I mean like the line we have a

1734
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:43,759
vigorous line that represents p91 very

1735
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:43,759
well

1736
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,659
nice

1737
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,500
anything you want to add to that local

1738
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:52,379
um

1739
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,519
um not that I can think of

1740
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,680
okay

1741
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,780
that's cool well is there anything else

1742
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:01,739
we want to say about selfing in the

1743
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:03,839
context of uh locking in uh

1744
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:05,699
just that it's the most effective for me

1745
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:11,338
in my opinion it's the most effective

1746
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:12,659
way of of breeding to lock in traits

1747
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:15,599
um

1748
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:17,460
however it can be done with Mills as

1749
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,420
effectively it's sometimes it's a lot

1750
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:23,400
more luck or a lot more experiential uh

1751
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:26,880
knowledge though

1752
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,980
yep yep and while we haven't really been

1753
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,400
constraining this conversation to be

1754
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:34,260
about breeding at smaller scales I think

1755
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,059
those of you who are interested in that

1756
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:37,140
you can already see what the advantages

1757
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,940
are

1758
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:40,318
in absolutely using something like

1759
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,599
selfing

1760
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:44,159
um if you don't have that much time

1761
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,619
space numbers

1762
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:49,440
when I did the most of my stealing work

1763
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:51,180
was when I was uh blowing up Apartments

1764
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,519
like multiple Apartments because it was

1765
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:55,259
small spaces like obviously I could

1766
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:56,940
knock down walls in these apartments so

1767
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,920
I couldn't like join them together and

1768
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,260
make a bigger space out of it so there's

1769
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,420
a lot of different small spaces with low

1770
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:06,539
electricity loads in those old ass

1771
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,980
Apartments so I I did a lot of selfing

1772
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:10,140
during those years and it was highly

1773
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:13,019
effective highly effective way of doing

1774
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:16,798
small space breeding

1775
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:18,539
nice nice I think that will be a juicy

1776
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:22,259
morsel for a lot of people

1777
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:23,819
well McKay I guess well I will add a

1778
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:26,159
color

1779
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:28,140
um is you know if you're a first time

1780
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,119
breeder it might not be the worst idea

1781
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:32,699
to kind of start with that because it

1782
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:34,679
gives you an accurate measure of what

1783
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:36,838
you're actually working with like you

1784
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:39,239
have direct

1785
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:42,000
you know representation of

1786
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:43,738
something that may be expressed in the

1787
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,738
process that's a good way of putting it

1788
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:49,439
something that maybe expressed me

1789
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:53,459
very nice I love that

1790
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:55,019
okay now we've gone to another I

1791
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,500
wouldn't say a favorite topic but maybe

1792
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:02,279
like a pet peeve more than anything yeah

1793
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:05,399
we have back Crossing now yeah I will

1794
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:08,040
say this I think I can say that

1795
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:10,679
for whatever reason there's a common

1796
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:12,238
misconception that back Crossing is just

1797
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:14,640
about

1798
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,338
um locking stuff in

1799
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,600
but in actuality it's a little bit more

1800
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:21,059
the context for it's a bit more

1801
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:25,079
complicated than that yeah um back

1802
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:28,080
Crossing in in in proper terms is you

1803
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:30,179
trying to incorporate a single trait a

1804
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:33,960
single new trait into a recurrent parent

1805
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:37,798
that's already stable that's the real

1806
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:40,198
function of back Crossing correct and if

1807
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:42,000
we go back to the idea that the

1808
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:43,858
likelihood of you having a true breeding

1809
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,100
recurrent parent

1810
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:49,739
is already very low super low

1811
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:52,739
it already kind of partly undermines

1812
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:55,259
this whole Enterprise one yes and two

1813
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:57,178
the possibility of you having another

1814
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,560
true breeding parent that's true reading

1815
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:01,079
for this one trait that you're trying to

1816
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,739
bring in to the other parent is also

1817
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:07,619
extremely low yeah so to me we're kind

1818
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:09,599
of I think that's why back Crossing as a

1819
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:11,519
concept in cannabis is so confused is

1820
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,860
because one people misunderstand what it

1821
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,780
actually is meant to do and number two

1822
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:19,519
people don't even have the correct

1823
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:19,519
starting conditions to do it correct

1824
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,039
um so that's that's how I wanted to

1825
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:23,819
introduce that

1826
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:25,738
um

1827
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,000
is there anything y'all would add to

1828
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:28,139
this because I know that there are lots

1829
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,960
of anecdotes

1830
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,900
um about like people's myths about bad

1831
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,119
Crossing in cannabis yeah

1832
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:38,460
um so one of the the biggest examples

1833
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,738
given or the most common used examples

1834
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:44,279
of back Crossing being massively

1835
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:45,839
successful is Cinderella 99.

1836
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:47,880
um it was some of the first examples in

1837
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,300
cannabis of people saying like check out

1838
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:54,420
my work this is vx1 and this is actually

1839
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:57,119
like 33 Cinder you know a princess and

1840
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:00,060
this one is 75 princess and this one's

1841
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,979
actually 99 princess so since the

1842
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,520
genetics have been back crossed this

1843
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:06,718
many times of course it's going to be 99

1844
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,800
princess you're always going to see

1845
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,380
princess

1846
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:13,079
and in theory that sounds great in

1847
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:16,079
practicality it did not work at all c99

1848
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:19,140
has many many phenos and expressions and

1849
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,460
traits and it's it's pretty broad it's

1850
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,440
pretty broad now there are some that

1851
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,899
occur more regularly like the grapefruit

1852
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:26,879
pineapple but there's a lot more than

1853
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:29,939
that there and to me it was a fine

1854
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,819
example of how back Crossing is used

1855
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:35,519
incorrectly understood like totally

1856
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:39,119
misunderstood like calling it like a 99

1857
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,280
princess that's not how cannabis works

1858
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,719
just like these simple crosses and no

1859
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,399
matter what you use as long as you're

1860
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,319
just back Crossing

1861
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,619
you're you're going to get 99 that's not

1862
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,939
how that's not how [ __ ] works so

1863
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:53,099
um you know most people throw that out

1864
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:56,698
as an as an example of how bat Crossing

1865
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:59,039
was A-Okay successful and to me it was

1866
01:11:56,698 --> 01:12:00,899
like the opposite like the the perfect

1867
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,119
proof of why

1868
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,679
um a perfect example of how

1869
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,300
misunderstood that crossing of the

1870
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:07,739
cannabis

1871
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,920
yeah

1872
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:13,439
um I you know I really don't think that

1873
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,980
there is a need to go really past the

1874
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,719
first back cross really you know because

1875
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:21,000
again

1876
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:23,939
in a back cross you should really know

1877
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
the starting material so you know let's

1878
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:29,000
take um Blue Bonnet for example you know

1879
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,979
it's something that's extremely stable

1880
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,619
and it's something that you know

1881
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:36,839
it I would feel confident using it in a

1882
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:39,779
background because like it just has

1883
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:42,480
visible traits that like you know you

1884
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:45,059
can link yeah as we were kind of

1885
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:47,158
chatting about earlier so it's like if

1886
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:49,199
that plant is stable then in that first

1887
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:52,019
generation you should be able to find

1888
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:56,099
what you want you know yes

1889
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:58,860
if you're getting more than what you

1890
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,320
want like do you even know what like

1891
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:02,819
genes you're targeting is there a goal

1892
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:05,819
in mind you know

1893
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:08,158
it it's a little more complex than just

1894
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:10,500
hitting the reoccurrent parent or

1895
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:13,319
whatever each time and I'll add into

1896
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:16,020
like in in the theory of back Crossing

1897
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:17,158
we are trying usually usually like when

1898
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,900
I'm doing a back cross especially like

1899
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:20,158
blue bonnet let's say blue bonnet the X1

1900
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:21,238
right

1901
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,839
um

1902
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:28,139
I am trying to find an outcross parent

1903
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:30,480
that is going to bring more stability to

1904
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:33,239
what I'm looking for so I'm not

1905
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,919
necessarily in a bx1 gonna go wild with

1906
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:37,259
the outcross or go something like

1907
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,359
totally opposite unless the trade I'm

1908
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:40,800
looking for is something in that and I

1909
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:43,380
know that's true reading too and it can

1910
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,119
absolutely bring that trade over if you

1911
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:47,340
take something completely different and

1912
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:47,880
bring it into your back cross

1913
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,340
um

1914
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:52,079
it can go any number of ways any number

1915
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,760
of ways and you're not effectively back

1916
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:54,960
Crossing at that point you know just

1917
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,900
kind of playing

1918
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,219
yeah yeah and I'll kind of paraphrase

1919
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:02,399
this a little differently which is that

1920
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:04,380
often in cannabis your individual plant

1921
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,299
that is you want to use as a recurring

1922
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,679
parent the individual plant that you

1923
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,179
want to use as the like I think they

1924
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,420
call it like introgressive parent

1925
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:13,980
they're likely to be largely

1926
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:16,260
um heterozygous

1927
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:19,500
yeah and if you are using heterozygous

1928
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:21,600
material you're not going to get the

1929
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:24,179
predicted results based on the model of

1930
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,340
that cross that that's just yeah that's

1931
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:27,300
just how it works

1932
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,500
um

1933
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,320
is there anything else you want to say

1934
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:34,140
about back Crossing um have we seen many

1935
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:37,738
successful examples of it in the market

1936
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:41,780
I mean I I would say I would say

1937
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:41,779
um it's a good example of a bx1

1938
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:49,019
I I'm not using myself but I I can't you

1939
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,520
know what exactly I'll say an example of

1940
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:54,120
um

1941
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:56,159
let's see a failed bx1 Maybe

1942
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,779
for my own

1943
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:01,319
um go for it

1944
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:04,738
um so with the Platinum banana OGB X1 I

1945
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:06,238
used a uh outcross is a long time ago

1946
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:08,399
and I hate even admitting this it was an

1947
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,698
outcross of cookies and cream banana OG

1948
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:15,000
and my my goal was to keep it

1949
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:17,219
banana OG dominant and

1950
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,260
it looked good in some of the crosses

1951
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:20,880
but what I found was that cookies and

1952
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:24,480
cream tended to dominate it and it was

1953
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:27,600
the outcross but it was so dominant and

1954
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,759
so different that it really brought too

1955
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,039
much variability into what I was trying

1956
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,079
to do so I feel like that a lot of those

1957
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:35,340
while they were they were decent and

1958
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:37,920
they made great lines and there was

1959
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:40,560
banana popping out a ton it wasn't what

1960
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,100
I wanted from a bx1 line so I consider

1961
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,100
it a failure

1962
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:48,299
yeah yeah

1963
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,679
thank you for that

1964
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,239
okay I figure it's easier to throw

1965
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,658
myself under the bus than other people

1966
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:56,039
it's less fun someone else yeah

1967
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:57,238
yeah because I think in many ways you

1968
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:58,920
could probably think of many back

1969
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:00,779
crosses that are not you know not

1970
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,219
definitely not it I could think about 30

1971
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:04,859
off the top of my head I'll keep myself

1972
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:07,619
yeah yeah we won't go there we won't go

1973
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:09,658
there okay so we're getting close to the

1974
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:13,500
end of this section on like an overview

1975
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:16,319
of various techniques for both

1976
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,119
um widening and narrowing

1977
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,799
um local I don't know at this point it's

1978
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:23,698
kind of it doesn't really fit anywhere

1979
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,100
but I wondered if you wanted to

1980
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:29,219
say anything about population-based

1981
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:33,380
breeding like as a concept

1982
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:33,380
um and how it may or may not fit

1983
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:38,819
um so I'll start with

1984
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:41,460
um cannabis is you know we're really

1985
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:43,559
fortunate to be able to hold on to

1986
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:46,800
things in vegetative state

1987
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,880
for [ __ ] ever essentially yes

1988
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,060
um so

1989
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,560
that in itself kind of eliminates the

1990
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,580
need

1991
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,580
um to uh

1992
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,539
um that that really uh defeats the need

1993
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:06,500
to um

1994
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:10,019
damn I I lost

1995
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:14,960
a nice one Matt nice one bro

1996
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:18,600
um more editing yes so um since uh

1997
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,640
since uh since we do uh have the ability

1998
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,520
to keep things around for an indefinite

1999
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,980
amount of time you know Theory

2000
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,500
um it it doesn't

2001
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:31,619
really push us to study populations

2002
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,479
because we can just hold this thing onto

2003
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:35,819
you for the rest of our lives

2004
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:38,459
you know which is cool we're very

2005
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:40,579
fortunate to have but what happens in

2006
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:44,219
the instance that we lose these things

2007
01:17:40,579 --> 01:17:46,920
yes you know I think there should kind

2008
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:50,819
of be a push for population type reading

2009
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:53,460
so that you can recover that thing that

2010
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:56,519
has been lost you know and population

2011
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:58,800
type could obviously you know include S1

2012
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,659
type reading yeah

2013
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,719
um you know because at the end of it

2014
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:05,698
your s1s are gonna be a population you

2015
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:07,980
know a group

2016
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:10,319
uh can I just be basic here and kind of

2017
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:12,658
ask you to even like just outline what

2018
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,219
what population breeding is

2019
01:18:12,658 --> 01:18:17,039
yeah

2020
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:20,640
um so I mean that's just gonna take into

2021
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:23,698
kind of um consideration into kind of

2022
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,480
like um selection you know

2023
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:27,359
um

2024
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:29,158
you have to weed things out to improve

2025
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:32,698
the population and move things forward

2026
01:18:29,158 --> 01:18:36,119
you know that in agriculture I feel like

2027
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:39,479
a lot of the breeding has been

2028
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:42,359
um forward and hasn't really focused on

2029
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:45,718
conserving things but in moving things

2030
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:47,639
forward there is progression but at the

2031
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:49,079
loss of

2032
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,420
you know

2033
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:54,079
certain genes that maybe we can't

2034
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,079
recover anymore

2035
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,260
yeah yeah

2036
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,159
um have we seen so would you say that

2037
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:03,779
like and maybe maybe I'm just

2038
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:05,639
reiterating an earlier point that was

2039
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:06,238
already made but

2040
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,219
um

2041
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:10,738
would you say that most of traditional

2042
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:12,060
breeding in cannabis

2043
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:14,759
um

2044
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,380
has been population breeding like you

2045
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,000
know pre-modern I guess is what I'm

2046
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,719
saying

2047
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,119
um

2048
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,219
I mean I I couldn't really say because I

2049
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,738
I don't I really don't know like kind of

2050
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:28,619
the whole anthropology of like Old World

2051
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:31,319
cannabis and how it turned off the world

2052
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:34,099
and I don't want to make stories up

2053
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:34,099
um why

2054
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:39,119
yeah okay yeah okay well then then this

2055
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,919
will just be a gesture towards this

2056
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:43,198
other kind of possibility I think we

2057
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,760
won't go too deep into it but yeah it's

2058
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:48,379
an interesting point to make I think

2059
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:52,020
nonetheless yeah okay so

2060
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:54,000
we I think for me this is kind of the

2061
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,679
end of this overview of breeding

2062
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,420
techniques and strategies and I wanted

2063
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,179
to move into this section on what makes

2064
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:02,279
breeding so hard but

2065
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:06,658
I think a good segue here is something

2066
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:08,340
that we've obviously uh talked uh

2067
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:10,679
implicitly about but we haven't actually

2068
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:14,159
addressed it in and of itself which is

2069
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:16,619
making selections

2070
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:18,539
yes obviously an integral part of

2071
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:21,960
reading

2072
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:25,800
um and yeah I mean where do we even

2073
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:28,079
begin with I want people to start I want

2074
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,239
people to start like maybe I shouldn't

2075
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:35,158
say I want people to start this is how I

2076
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:38,279
think of my plants in in a reading

2077
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:39,839
context I think of each individual plant

2078
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:41,819
and I'm not talking about strains I'm

2079
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,600
talking about each individual plant as a

2080
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:45,179
tool

2081
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:48,239
and each tool has a different set of

2082
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:49,319
traits so when I go and and plan a

2083
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,559
project

2084
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:53,698
I'm I'm considering what traits I have

2085
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,980
available

2086
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:57,658
and I'm also considering where I would

2087
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:58,439
like to go and a lot of times I don't

2088
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:00,899
even

2089
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:03,259
necessarily consider what I have

2090
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:06,479
available I think of something like

2091
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:09,480
cinnamon for example just a single Cent

2092
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:11,759
a single trade I want cinnamon how can I

2093
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:14,000
how could I come up with that with the

2094
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,219
tools I have available is it possible

2095
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,439
how many steps would it take

2096
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:22,140
um things like that is but mostly is it

2097
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:25,079
possible and if it's not reassess my

2098
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:28,140
goals or

2099
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:29,460
um find plants that I know will get me

2100
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,719
to the goal

2101
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:34,260
so

2102
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,819
I think of each plant like a tool in

2103
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,199
that sense of like a brush a different

2104
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:39,299
brush you can use to paint a different

2105
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,719
picture in other words

2106
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,719
yeah yeah

2107
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,340
um it's a funny one because I often I

2108
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:49,259
see questions where people are like how

2109
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,179
do you select and it's like sure you

2110
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:53,100
know you we can give principles but this

2111
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:55,380
is really where it does become more

2112
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,699
about the art right because absolutely I

2113
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,760
think like both of you alluded to

2114
01:21:56,698 --> 01:22:02,639
earlier like so much of it is about what

2115
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,380
you yourself want need what your

2116
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,940
environmental pressures are dictating

2117
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,400
for you

2118
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:10,738
um what your starting material

2119
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:12,238
um is already constraining you to so

2120
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:15,959
it's not there isn't really a silver

2121
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:18,119
bullet for selection and there's a

2122
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,800
reason like a casual answer there is

2123
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:21,238
also one other thing that we haven't

2124
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,960
really discussed and that's the

2125
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:27,178
invariable or and intangibles the

2126
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:31,198
intangible traits of smoking

2127
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:33,658
effect smoking for effect this is a

2128
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:35,579
trait that is not just intangible

2129
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:38,339
meaning we can't you can't necessarily

2130
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:40,559
touch it feel it observe it with all

2131
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:42,539
your most of your senses right your your

2132
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,580
it's a sense yeah it's a whole different

2133
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:45,899
sense that we don't really normally tap

2134
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:46,619
into

2135
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:49,139
um

2136
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:51,359
and it's individual it's not just

2137
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:53,880
individual per person it's individual

2138
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,619
percent and setting so you can have

2139
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,179
different effects from the same exact

2140
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:59,399
growth the same exact strain the same

2141
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:01,260
exact bud in the same exact pipe and not

2142
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:03,359
finish the bowl and get a completely

2143
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,619
different effect from it

2144
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,019
um at a different time in the day let's

2145
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:08,579
say you're you're really stressed and

2146
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,960
versus when you were earlier that

2147
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:11,399
morning you're totally you know in a

2148
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,219
good mood blah blah blah smoking

2149
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:15,899
everything's fine happy chilling you get

2150
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:17,399
home from work you're super stressed

2151
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:19,139
you've got a lot of caffeine that day

2152
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:20,639
and you smoke and it's a completely

2153
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,820
different effect now you're getting more

2154
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,520
anxiety now you're getting more paranoia

2155
01:23:22,819 --> 01:23:28,259
effect is is the intangible it's one of

2156
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,179
the most in my opinion one of the most

2157
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,880
important parts of reading for in

2158
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:33,840
cannabis and probably the hardest to

2159
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,640
quantify

2160
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,159
so I wanted to definitely bring that up

2161
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:42,239
at this point

2162
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:45,479
yeah for sure and I think when we were

2163
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:46,319
talking yesterday in preparation for

2164
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,559
this

2165
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:51,599
you also mentioned like

2166
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:54,239
you wanted to talk about applying proper

2167
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,699
observation techniques

2168
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:58,619
um and controlling variables and

2169
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,899
ensuring that

2170
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:03,479
everything that you observe

2171
01:24:00,899 --> 01:24:06,359
is relative to stable you know

2172
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:07,500
observational conditions and I guess

2173
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:09,359
that's another key part of making

2174
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,238
selections is like how consistently are

2175
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,039
you growing these these plants you know

2176
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:14,819
um how consistent is your environment

2177
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:16,859
Etc

2178
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:19,019
yeah I touched on that earlier another

2179
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:21,299
thing like seed buyers don't usually

2180
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:23,699
take into account that I think is also

2181
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:25,260
very important and as a breeder I take

2182
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:27,119
this into account when I'm making seeds

2183
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,820
and who I sell the seeds to and how I

2184
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:31,979
sell them to them is where are your

2185
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:33,658
seeds being made

2186
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:36,479
um or who are you breeding for who's

2187
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:38,460
your target audience or more that's more

2188
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:39,959
important who's your target audience is

2189
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,760
this seed you're going to be sharing

2190
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:43,739
with your friends are these seeds you're

2191
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,179
making for yourself

2192
01:24:43,738 --> 01:24:48,299
um

2193
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:50,100
indoor seeds made indoor for indoor

2194
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:53,460
people is great

2195
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:55,620
seeds made indoor tend to do well for

2196
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:58,859
outdoor they tend to do well going

2197
01:24:55,619 --> 01:25:00,719
outdoor however seeds made outdoor don't

2198
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:02,039
always do well like let's say I'm a

2199
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,039
breeder and I'm making all my seeds

2200
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:06,539
outdoor and my customers are 90 indoor

2201
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,340
that's where you're going to see a lot

2202
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:10,140
of problems with people saying man this

2203
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:11,600
stuff keeps hurting you know it's

2204
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,400
completely different

2205
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:16,620
environments where they've been

2206
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:18,658
acclimated completely different and

2207
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:21,300
that's a super important part to

2208
01:25:18,658 --> 01:25:23,158
consider so who is your audience and

2209
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,420
again who is your audience how serious

2210
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:25,679
are you going to take this if it's just

2211
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,539
for you and your friends are you going

2212
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,920
to worry about pollen contamination as

2213
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,719
much as you would if you're selling

2214
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,460
these seeds where people are paying good

2215
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,560
money for them and these are customers

2216
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,658
that you want to keep very happy or is

2217
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,699
it just your friends the target audience

2218
01:25:36,658 --> 01:25:39,960
is another super important part when

2219
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:43,859
you're going through your reading goals

2220
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,300
and what I'm Who is my intended user end

2221
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:46,738
user of this

2222
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,300
yeah and I guess I'll point out

2223
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,759
something really obvious which is that

2224
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,340
your breeding goals obviously will at

2225
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,739
least majorly dictate your selection

2226
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:57,360
s yes right and if they're not lined up

2227
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:59,279
in something's obviously wrong yeah

2228
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:02,279
something just disappointedly obvious

2229
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:04,619
just to point out obvious yeah um okay

2230
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:06,719
so just to zoom out a bit and just

2231
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:08,399
re-situate us when what we're talking

2232
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,859
about right now this is kind of more of

2233
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:12,119
a summary section and kind of trying to

2234
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:13,799
situate

2235
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:15,719
um some of the principles and techniques

2236
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,940
we've already outlined in a more

2237
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:20,520
practical sense and and kind of

2238
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:22,500
address this this question of like what

2239
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,560
are all the complexities and nuances of

2240
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,679
breeding and so we've covered like why

2241
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:31,620
we can't straightforwardly apply uh the

2242
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:33,179
science we've covered the difficulties

2243
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:36,000
in actually knowing your starting

2244
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:37,739
material in all your planets we've

2245
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,800
covered applying you know proper

2246
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:42,539
observation techniques and uh Matt just

2247
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,400
addressed like the complexities and

2248
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:47,399
setting even goals for yourself when

2249
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:50,039
you're breeding so I think one really

2250
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:53,099
big one that is worth talking about when

2251
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:55,380
it comes to difficulty is just how much

2252
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:57,480
time and how expensive this whole

2253
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,980
endeavor

2254
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:01,138
can be

2255
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:02,579
sure

2256
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:05,159
it's uh

2257
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:06,600
you know and and I thought about this a

2258
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:08,219
lot in other episodes but when it comes

2259
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,940
to reversals

2260
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:10,560
um

2261
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:12,419
early on there wasn't a lot of us doing

2262
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,760
them in the United States and it was

2263
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,960
often called like we the few of us that

2264
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,579
were doing it we're you know you're

2265
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,139
taking the cheap route you're taking the

2266
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:21,300
the easy route that's the shortcut

2267
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:22,859
that's all this that but realistically

2268
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:25,440
like there's so much failure in

2269
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:27,899
reversals and um that it is very

2270
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:29,698
expensive it and it takes a lot of time

2271
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:32,460
if you fail at a reversal and you don't

2272
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:34,439
have a backup and and keeping backups is

2273
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,300
tricky because that's when you may

2274
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:38,039
encounter pollen contamination if you

2275
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,960
don't time it correctly or have it

2276
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:42,238
spaced out right

2277
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:45,960
um it's a very expensive process whether

2278
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:48,479
you're doing male to female or feminized

2279
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:51,420
but I found it much much more expensive

2280
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:53,399
and costly with feminization only

2281
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:56,359
because of the failure rate it's very

2282
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:58,859
easy not to fail as far as pollen taking

2283
01:27:56,359 --> 01:28:01,019
in male to female breeding but in

2284
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:03,479
actually doing breeding when I'm also

2285
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,699
saying failure it's did you meet your

2286
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:07,619
goal and that's another part where it

2287
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:09,779
can get very expensive if you're very

2288
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:11,579
goal oriented and you haven't end goal

2289
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:13,439
and you're sticking to it and you're and

2290
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:16,380
you're working to that goal no matter

2291
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:19,079
what it takes time it takes money it

2292
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:20,460
takes space space is important the more

2293
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:22,079
numbers you run the better the chance

2294
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,460
you are of finding something you'd like

2295
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:24,960
to use

2296
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,460
um so yeah

2297
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,198
I think that's a really good distinction

2298
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:30,359
as well like there's they're the fail

2299
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:33,479
the kind of like mechanical failures and

2300
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:34,859
execution of the techniques or steps and

2301
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:36,919
then they're the failures to actually

2302
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:38,698
meet goals and those are actually quite

2303
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,340
distinct although of course they're

2304
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:46,138
connected yeah um

2305
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:46,980
so we had a we had a question here about

2306
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:49,679
um

2307
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:53,099
no so this is from farmer Dan and I know

2308
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:55,319
we had an example uh he asked

2309
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,120
how do you know when to work a line and

2310
01:28:55,319 --> 01:29:00,539
when to leave it alone like when do you

2311
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:02,460
stop go back instead of just pressing on

2312
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:04,260
um and I think you two mentioned to me

2313
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,439
you know like hi and Lonesome you know

2314
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:09,840
had had to go back with his Appalachia

2315
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:12,359
yeah and it's one of those things that

2316
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,760
like you know a lot of people talk about

2317
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:17,939
this but not a lot of people actually go

2318
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:20,579
back multiple generations and take the

2319
01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:22,738
time or even make the observations like

2320
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:24,719
I've run enough of this stuff myself and

2321
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:26,399
I've decided this isn't a good

2322
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,840
representation of what I wanted to put

2323
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,299
out there I'm not going to release these

2324
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,639
I'm going to go ahead and go back to the

2325
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,199
F2 when I'm already at F5 so three

2326
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,579
generations take it back I'm gonna go

2327
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:38,158
ahead and start back here the last time

2328
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:40,079
I saw a population I'm really happy with

2329
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,759
and I'm gonna see if I can reselect this

2330
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,198
and there's so few times I've seen this

2331
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,840
and especially when someone's worked

2332
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:48,359
something up to F5 jump back to F2 work

2333
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,960
it back up in that direction

2334
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:53,759
um but it's a trait of a real breeder it

2335
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,340
is the absolute trait of a real breeder

2336
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,840
to be that goal oriented and like I said

2337
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:59,340
it's not very common and that's one of

2338
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,319
the major reasons I look up to high

2339
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:03,360
loans so much is because he is that goal

2340
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:05,399
oriented willing to do the hard work

2341
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,079
yeah I think this is where it comes to

2342
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:10,259
like your breeding philosophy your

2343
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:12,899
ethics your professionalism

2344
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:15,239
um all those things yeah

2345
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:16,439
um absolutely

2346
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:19,500
so

2347
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:21,419
for me we're coming to like an end of

2348
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,399
sorts like I was just this section was

2349
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,520
kind of just like us zooming out and

2350
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:28,559
looking back and and trying to summarize

2351
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,239
some of the difficulties in breathing

2352
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,239
and I guess I want to say here

2353
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,659
um

2354
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:38,519
this isn't meant to discourage or

2355
01:30:36,658 --> 01:30:41,339
um demotivate people

2356
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:44,400
um or dishearten people about breeding

2357
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:46,319
no I think really we well for me anyway

2358
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:48,359
and and kind of like sort of producing

2359
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:51,359
this episode I think

2360
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:53,339
I just saw that there was a big gap in

2361
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,460
in the discourse around breeding where

2362
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:58,619
people don't really talk about these

2363
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,840
gaps and and complexities and nuances

2364
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,579
that often like if you if you're a late

2365
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,279
if you're an amateur like Enthusiast

2366
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:08,460
like me and you Google cannabis breeding

2367
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:10,559
all the stuff that you see that comes up

2368
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,779
and your top results are gonna be like

2369
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,280
[ __ ]

2370
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:16,380
a lot of the time you're going to get

2371
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:19,259
like European Sea Banks with their like

2372
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:21,840
there's the same blog post being copied

2373
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:23,460
like over and over again yes and it's

2374
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,020
going to address just the most basic

2375
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:27,539
mendelian stuff that we went over

2376
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:30,780
earlier for example

2377
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:34,560
so was there anything else in terms of

2378
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:38,219
like practical difficulties that you two

2379
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:41,960
want to add to this mix of like

2380
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:41,960
you know what makes this [ __ ] hard

2381
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:46,619
what makes it hard

2382
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,420
and in like

2383
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:49,679
this is a lot of the reason I kind of

2384
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:51,480
keep going back to the blue bonnet but

2385
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,399
it's it's one of those really really

2386
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:55,259
rare lines

2387
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:56,939
um and I and it's been hard to explain

2388
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,260
this to people

2389
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:00,539
um and I hope this episode helps

2390
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:03,539
illustrate it when you have a male that

2391
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:06,060
is true reading for a trait that is a

2392
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:07,439
very desirable trait but also most

2393
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:10,679
representations of that line

2394
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:12,359
specifically are low potency low resin

2395
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:13,739
production or not super high resin

2396
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:15,960
production filled with oils and stuff

2397
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:17,759
and it came with so many other good

2398
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,840
traits that it also reached true for so

2399
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,400
not only does it breed true for

2400
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,219
blueberry it breeds true for a few other

2401
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:26,460
traits and that was the key to me first

2402
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:28,380
that I realized that it probably wasn't

2403
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:30,300
a pure blueberry line because it was

2404
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:33,239
vigorous it had a lot of traits that

2405
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:34,800
aren't even existing in blueberry and

2406
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:36,539
um yeah and it breached true for those

2407
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,219
traits so it was heavily worked but it

2408
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:39,719
wasn't heavily worked in a direction

2409
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,579
that was so inbred that I'm seeing

2410
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:43,439
mutations everywhere in fact it was

2411
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:46,019
missing a lot of the uh the mutations

2412
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:48,238
that commonly pop up in blueberry but it

2413
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,980
still had extreme blueberry terms

2414
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:52,019
um it's also why I have a hard time

2415
01:32:49,979 --> 01:32:53,399
moving on from Blue bonus stuff because

2416
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:55,380
when you find something that true

2417
01:32:53,399 --> 01:32:58,079
breeding I I just don't know of any

2418
01:32:55,380 --> 01:33:00,659
other tool in cannabis quite like it and

2419
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:03,899
I haven't run into it as far as males go

2420
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:06,359
as far as for regular breeding goes and

2421
01:33:03,899 --> 01:33:08,279
is trying to explain to people what is

2422
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:10,439
so special about the work that Lone Star

2423
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,000
did is very hard because people just say

2424
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:14,339
it's just someone took blueberry and

2425
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,158
it's that you know anybody could do that

2426
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:19,500
I wasn't able to do it he did in many

2427
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:21,658
years of trying uh running a lot of the

2428
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:24,238
progeny making the crosses I could never

2429
01:33:21,658 --> 01:33:26,039
get it past just blueberry Terps without

2430
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,599
and I couldn't bring the potency and I

2431
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:31,019
couldn't bring any resin production with

2432
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,000
even in outcrosses so

2433
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:35,400
there's a lot of special stuff that can

2434
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,260
be done in cannabis there is a way to

2435
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:39,960
make true breeding strains it can be

2436
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:41,579
done but it takes a ton of work and

2437
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,800
that's not again not to discourage

2438
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:45,719
anyone it's to encourage you to do more

2439
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,760
work it's to encourage you and say that

2440
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:49,859
this can be done and there is special

2441
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,300
stuff like that out there and I did try

2442
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:53,639
to make that tool available for everyone

2443
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:56,100
and left it at a nursery for anybody to

2444
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:57,239
use that mail because I felt like when

2445
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,579
you find something that's special in

2446
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:01,198
cannabis if you sit on it you're kind of

2447
01:33:59,579 --> 01:34:02,519
a prick

2448
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:03,960
um it's a very special tool that

2449
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,960
everybody should be able to use and

2450
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:08,520
blueberry has very that that scent for

2451
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,279
whatever reason has very medical

2452
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:12,719
applications that come along with it in

2453
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:14,759
my opinion and and for a lot of people

2454
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:17,760
who smoke it whether it's anti-anxiety

2455
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,560
nerve pain relief pain relief period And

2456
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,020
so with those medical applications to

2457
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:24,600
sit on that would be super selfish so I

2458
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:27,659
tried but the nursery ended up giving

2459
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,340
hbov so it no longer exists but I do

2460
01:34:27,658 --> 01:34:31,679
believe that people find stuff like that

2461
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,119
share it share it give it to the

2462
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:36,119
community it's that important reading

2463
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:37,679
tools like that can open shift people's

2464
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:39,000
paradigms on what can be achieved and

2465
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,219
accomplished and I'm not even the best

2466
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,539
at what I do so I can imagine what

2467
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:44,880
something like that would do and

2468
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:47,039
something in someone super competent or

2469
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,880
someone's super creative's hands you

2470
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:50,039
know someone that thinks much

2471
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,440
differently than me

2472
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:54,119
yeah and I you know I I think it's good

2473
01:34:52,439 --> 01:34:55,979
that you keep uh drawing our attention

2474
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:58,139
to the Bluebonnet because

2475
01:34:55,979 --> 01:35:00,238
it is exceptional and like we what like

2476
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:03,179
we what we mentioned like it is rare to

2477
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:05,158
find something that has

2478
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:08,880
you know relatively fixed traits that do

2479
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:10,859
pass and yeah that is yeah yeah and and

2480
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,859
I want to re I want to restate again

2481
01:35:10,859 --> 01:35:15,599
it's not flashing my buttons it like

2482
01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:17,639
bragging about blue bonnet because it's

2483
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,920
not my work I mean I've done work with

2484
01:35:17,639 --> 01:35:21,480
it that line is not my work it was done

2485
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:23,158
by someone else named Lone Star from

2486
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:24,899
Texas resin company he's no longer with

2487
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:26,939
us and

2488
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:28,738
it's more to shine a spotlight on him

2489
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:30,119
and his work and his contributions in

2490
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:33,059
cannabis

2491
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:34,260
yep yep yep

2492
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:35,940
um local was there anything else you

2493
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,739
wanted to add on this kind of like

2494
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,719
summary of

2495
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:41,158
all the complexities of breeding and

2496
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:43,260
what makes it difficult at least from

2497
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:46,439
this General level yeah

2498
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:48,600
um I guess I'll just say make sure that

2499
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:50,399
what you're hunting and wanting to breed

2500
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:54,420
with is something that you're genuinely

2501
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:56,638
excited about because you know as soon

2502
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:59,819
as you lose interest in something you

2503
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:01,619
kind of lose motivation and where to

2504
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:02,899
take it

2505
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:06,658
um

2506
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:09,059
and to also understand that each plant

2507
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:12,238
is a tool like Matt was saying it's like

2508
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:15,120
you know me for example when I was doing

2509
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:17,519
seed pops it's like I was trying to find

2510
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:20,340
the thing that was most comparable to

2511
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:23,040
Sweet Pea but then you realize this

2512
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:25,619
isn't the way to hunt because like you

2513
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:27,000
know sweet pea is its own thing these

2514
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:28,559
other plants

2515
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,079
they're not related there's something

2516
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:34,139
different you know why am I looking for

2517
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:38,639
this and this when that's like you know

2518
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:41,219
not what it is yeah

2519
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,380
yeah really really good point I think

2520
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:44,819
there are like quite a few different we

2521
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,560
haven't really dived into this too much

2522
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:49,319
we've implied a lot of it there are a

2523
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:51,000
lot of interesting psychological

2524
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:53,039
um

2525
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,479
uh phenomena when it comes to breeding

2526
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:56,639
and things you have to overcome whether

2527
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,500
it's like the stress of knowing that

2528
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,219
you're you're you're doing these like

2529
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:04,139
big gambles whether it's about tension

2530
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:07,020
within yourself about what your goals

2531
01:37:04,139 --> 01:37:09,000
are or what material you should be using

2532
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:10,860
I think there's so many interesting like

2533
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,020
yeah

2534
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:15,719
um side effects to breathe I think do

2535
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:17,940
you think failure and and the ability

2536
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:19,800
like the one thing I see the most that

2537
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:21,119
people have the most trouble with and it

2538
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,779
was what we start talked about at the

2539
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:26,519
beginning was being really really honest

2540
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:29,238
with oneself about

2541
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,560
how you spent your money on your seeds

2542
01:37:29,238 --> 01:37:33,899
what you have

2543
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:36,420
who who made it

2544
01:37:33,899 --> 01:37:39,238
and just because you've invested money

2545
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:41,779
into it doesn't mean it's what you want

2546
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:41,779
it to be

2547
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:48,500
confirmation bias is a huge cost fallacy

2548
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:48,500
yeah

2549
01:37:48,539 --> 01:37:51,060
yeah

2550
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:53,400
totally

2551
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:55,739
okay

2552
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:57,479
um if there's nothing else that you two

2553
01:37:55,738 --> 01:37:59,879
want to add I did have a couple of

2554
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:02,638
community questions just to type it off

2555
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:05,639
let's do it um

2556
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:07,619
so uh someone who was an overnight

2557
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:08,880
sensation in the Discord is no longer in

2558
01:38:07,619 --> 01:38:12,420
the Discord and we don't know whether

2559
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:14,340
they're like real or not um asked what

2560
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:17,520
fundamental breeding skills deserve more

2561
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:20,119
attention than most people appreciate

2562
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,120
research

2563
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,840
research number one number one most

2564
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:25,919
people think that they are well

2565
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,719
researched because they have a High

2566
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,219
Times magazine or because they back

2567
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:31,859
write a forum

2568
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:34,020
that you know is one of the few out of

2569
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:35,339
the many that were existing that they

2570
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,840
think might have the best data because

2571
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:38,340
it's old and that's not necessarily the

2572
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,840
case it might just have the most

2573
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:41,600
successful seed bank attached to it and

2574
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,800
that's why it's still around you know

2575
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,780
might be the most successful marketing

2576
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:48,119
SEO that's why it's still around and

2577
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:49,738
survived the much better forums so

2578
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:52,380
research

2579
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:53,459
is just if you don't do it you never

2580
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,560
know where you're going to start and

2581
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,480
you're just so hard to say this but

2582
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,679
you're really in many senses when it

2583
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:01,919
comes to breeding you're just playing

2584
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:03,960
and giving yourself bad data points or

2585
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,179
not bad data points because every data

2586
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:07,859
point is a data point but maybe no more

2587
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:10,619
null data points because you're going to

2588
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,238
have to toss them out at some point

2589
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:13,920
yeah

2590
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,599
yeah

2591
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:20,039
how about you local

2592
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:22,440
I mean one uh research is obviously you

2593
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:25,079
know really important because

2594
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:27,479
you know not knowing what your baselines

2595
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:29,519
are kind of just you know voids

2596
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:33,119
everything out because you can't compare

2597
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:35,820
something like you can't trace ancestry

2598
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:38,519
you know and no matter what philos says

2599
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:40,139
exactly and that's another thing real

2600
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:42,000
quick I want to interject

2601
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:43,920
going to philos looking at their data is

2602
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,380
not research like this has been proven

2603
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,060
to talk about it but right and you know

2604
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,760
that has to do with the whole provenance

2605
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:53,580
thing but you know one thing that kind

2606
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:55,980
of like resonated with me between this

2607
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:59,698
community and like the science Community

2608
01:39:55,979 --> 01:40:01,619
is in quantitative genetics you know we

2609
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:04,319
kind of have a similar goal of like

2610
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:07,139
being able to tell what something is

2611
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:09,238
based off of growing Generations not

2612
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:14,159
just like one plant but multiple

2613
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:16,500
Generations parental you know uh F1 F2

2614
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:17,579
you know in crosses all that because

2615
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:20,760
like

2616
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:23,340
the more information you have you know

2617
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:25,020
with these populations the more it tells

2618
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:27,719
you about what your starting material

2619
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:29,699
was but not only that it tells you

2620
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:32,279
what's behind your starting material

2621
01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:35,099
because Beyond a certain point like the

2622
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:38,359
story just says yes and we don't know

2623
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:41,100
what happens before that sadly

2624
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:43,979
yeah yeah

2625
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:46,739
so I guess ultimately you just want as

2626
01:40:43,979 --> 01:40:48,479
much information as you can get however

2627
01:40:46,738 --> 01:40:50,638
you can get it whether it's by a

2628
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:51,779
provenance whether it's by a progeny

2629
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,420
testing

2630
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:56,639
yeah you want you want to maximize your

2631
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:58,500
information space before you begin

2632
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,779
good information because there's just so

2633
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:02,939
much bad information and in cannabis

2634
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:06,719
maximizing your information space isn't

2635
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:08,939
necessarily better it's maximizing your

2636
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:11,219
yeah reliable information space which is

2637
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:14,039
the hardest part hardest part to get to

2638
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:17,460
and that goes back to the research

2639
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:19,679
yeah very good distinction

2640
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:22,260
um okay well we're kind of coming to the

2641
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:25,260
end of this episode and just to remind

2642
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:28,260
people what the intention was here

2643
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:29,400
the intention was really to set the

2644
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:33,840
scene

2645
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:36,479
to set the tone of like where does the

2646
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,579
theory get us where does it not get us

2647
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:41,279
what are some of the Practical

2648
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:43,019
complexities of breeding what uh the

2649
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:44,939
trade-offs of some of the individual

2650
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:47,100
techniques

2651
01:41:44,939 --> 01:41:50,099
um what we have not addressed obviously

2652
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,619
is any specific

2653
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:53,880
scenarios

2654
01:41:51,618 --> 01:41:55,618
for example they are going to be

2655
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:56,819
breeding scenarios where obviously

2656
01:41:55,618 --> 01:41:59,339
you're going to need a combination of

2657
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:01,500
these techniques yes which is going to

2658
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:03,539
increase the complexity yet again and we

2659
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,340
haven't approached those things yet but

2660
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:07,198
I think our goal for the next few

2661
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:10,260
episodes I don't know how many there

2662
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:12,118
will be is to and I haven't decided on

2663
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:15,300
this but I'm assuming it's either to

2664
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:17,279
cover historical projects where there's

2665
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:20,340
a lot to learn from them

2666
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:23,219
or to cover hypothetical breeding

2667
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:25,139
projects where we can continue to tease

2668
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:27,960
out some of the nuances some of the

2669
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:30,060
possible approaches because I think as

2670
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,980
y'all are gathering like there's so many

2671
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,420
possible permutations of techniques that

2672
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:35,579
you could use as well you don't just

2673
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:37,260
have to use one technique for your

2674
01:42:35,579 --> 01:42:38,399
projects at different points of your

2675
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:41,520
project you might need to use different

2676
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:45,960
tools right so I hope that we can get

2677
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:48,060
into the particularities and nuances in

2678
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:51,359
the subsequent episodes

2679
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:52,980
yeah I think I think I think we will one

2680
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:54,599
of the number one questions I'm asked is

2681
01:42:52,979 --> 01:42:57,599
can you cross a regular male to a

2682
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,800
feminist see yeah got plenty of room to

2683
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,480
cover those

2684
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,739
yeah we've got lots of cool questions

2685
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:02,519
like that

2686
01:43:01,738 --> 01:43:05,459
um

2687
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:07,679
and I think again when it comes to

2688
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:10,439
setting the tone and we already I don't

2689
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:12,600
apologize for this too much right but

2690
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:14,279
um we took this kind of really honest

2691
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,020
candid approach

2692
01:43:14,279 --> 01:43:16,979
um almost kind of like pessimistic

2693
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,960
approach

2694
01:43:16,979 --> 01:43:20,638
just basically just trying to be real

2695
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:23,520
with people

2696
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:26,159
and trying to be as clear as we can be

2697
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:28,380
to the best of our knowledge on what you

2698
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:30,859
actually are going to face

2699
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:34,440
and I don't think there's any reason to

2700
01:43:30,859 --> 01:43:36,118
like be optimistic and skate over what

2701
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:38,219
are clearly going to be obstacles for

2702
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:40,319
people so I think that was the major

2703
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:42,060
intent of this episode and sending the

2704
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:43,859
foundation for future conversations

2705
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:45,659
about breeding

2706
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:47,399
is there anything else that

2707
01:43:45,658 --> 01:43:50,219
like the two of you

2708
01:43:47,399 --> 01:43:52,738
um would like to add at this point

2709
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:56,219
go ahead local anything

2710
01:43:52,738 --> 01:43:57,539
I mean just do what's fun for you you

2711
01:43:56,219 --> 01:44:00,179
know like

2712
01:43:57,539 --> 01:44:02,158
you're the person making this election

2713
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:04,560
what are you excited about in selections

2714
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,738
you're seeing right now

2715
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,739
um

2716
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:09,920
I mean

2717
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:14,340
I've been really pumped about some of

2718
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:15,239
the Appalachia stuff

2719
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:18,480
um

2720
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:19,019
and it's really kind of interesting

2721
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:21,419
um

2722
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:23,820
you know

2723
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:26,520
having seen some of these stuff with the

2724
01:44:23,819 --> 01:44:27,840
Appalachia you know and now that I'm

2725
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,219
kind of flowering out the good old

2726
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:32,400
Mountain Dew I think it's going to be

2727
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:34,920
really cool to kind of see you know what

2728
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:37,019
the difference in selection did

2729
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:40,020
you know are there going to be similar

2730
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:42,659
smell profiles you know because to me

2731
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:44,580
right now like what I'm smelling in this

2732
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:47,460
you know in the good old Mountain Dew is

2733
01:44:44,579 --> 01:44:50,100
not what I've smelled like in the Silver

2734
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:52,500
Mountain Haze or the yo mama or any of

2735
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:55,860
that yeah it's a really different range

2736
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:57,960
of smell really so you know it's kind of

2737
01:44:55,859 --> 01:45:00,920
cool to like slowly like

2738
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:04,739
kind of pick away at these like you know

2739
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:07,139
comparisons that you know are

2740
01:45:04,738 --> 01:45:08,099
they're not like apple to Apple but it's

2741
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:11,760
not like

2742
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:14,460
Apple to Orange you know sure you're

2743
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:17,579
seeing different parallels that that's a

2744
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:20,158
better way to put it you know

2745
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:22,979
um so I think that's really cool

2746
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:25,738
um having seen you know um some of pax

2747
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:27,658
uh train wreck stuff in person like I

2748
01:45:25,738 --> 01:45:30,238
thought that was really [ __ ] dope

2749
01:45:27,658 --> 01:45:33,118
because like homie literally brought the

2750
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:36,118
entire lineup I mean he did not really

2751
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:38,039
but you know most of what we had and it

2752
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:39,599
was really cool to kind of see how train

2753
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:42,960
wreck blended with some of these things

2754
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:45,600
and kind of also be able to see like

2755
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,800
that hey you know this

2756
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,020
thing

2757
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:53,279
um so-called dominance is a real thing

2758
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:55,380
because I I saw it you know yeah it can

2759
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,300
for sure be dominant over a lot of

2760
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:59,699
things but also it could blend

2761
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:02,039
beautifully there are a few things that

2762
01:45:59,698 --> 01:46:04,799
Blended amazing With You know despite

2763
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:07,859
its dominance and so I think that's

2764
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:11,699
really one of the like

2765
01:46:07,859 --> 01:46:13,559
you know takeaways really is you're

2766
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:15,899
never really gonna know until you see it

2767
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:20,400
or until you make the combination either

2768
01:46:15,899 --> 01:46:22,799
like and you know yeah dominance we know

2769
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,839
it in theory like we know it's a thing

2770
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,779
but to be able to see it you know it's

2771
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:30,000
totally different

2772
01:46:27,779 --> 01:46:33,179
yeah and I'm glad you mentioned some of

2773
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,920
the homies projects because yeah again I

2774
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:37,980
think in the subsequent episodes it's a

2775
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,600
perfect time to dip and like dig deeper

2776
01:46:37,979 --> 01:46:42,779
into some of those stories because I

2777
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:45,000
think they're so rich every project is

2778
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:46,859
so rich like with learning um that we

2779
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,679
could share with other people

2780
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:52,139
so yeah

2781
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,179
I guess that's uh it I don't really have

2782
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:55,380
anything else to add other than you know

2783
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:57,600
like uh

2784
01:46:55,380 --> 01:47:00,539
check out our Discord patreon if you

2785
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,699
want to do research with us we're all

2786
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:04,920
there interacting a lot like even in the

2787
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:08,219
audio chat and um

2788
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:11,340
this is what we live eat sleep breathe

2789
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:12,420
drink this is a true passion for most of

2790
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,079
us

2791
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:14,880
um

2792
01:47:13,079 --> 01:47:17,460
like we talk about it here a lot like

2793
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,940
nerd out but like this is all some of us

2794
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:23,219
do like yeah I want to add I want to add

2795
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:25,198
here too that like at the moment these

2796
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:27,840
episodes are kind of being co-

2797
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:31,379
co-written in a way by our community

2798
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:34,619
members absolutely so we're actually

2799
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:36,779
like building this alongside what

2800
01:47:34,618 --> 01:47:38,819
everyone else is talking about their

2801
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:41,099
input is so important so important I

2802
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:44,039
mean as I've been doing this a long time

2803
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:46,560
like trying to educate with what little

2804
01:47:44,039 --> 01:47:49,920
I know but a lot with what other people

2805
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,900
have taught me you know and um this has

2806
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,060
helped a ton and and I've learned a lot

2807
01:47:51,899 --> 01:47:56,099
from them and they're helping

2808
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:57,900
they're helping me figure out what I

2809
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,219
haven't covered in the past and maybe

2810
01:47:57,899 --> 01:48:01,198
things that like I wouldn't have even

2811
01:47:59,219 --> 01:48:03,600
taken into account because I'm so busy

2812
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:05,339
like with my head in a specific part of

2813
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,500
breeding that I haven't even touched on

2814
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:09,179
a lot of the the stuff that I should

2815
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,679
have touched on earlier like bringing it

2816
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:11,940
back so this has been amazing it's been

2817
01:48:10,679 --> 01:48:13,618
a great experience

2818
01:48:11,939 --> 01:48:16,198
and we will get we'll definitely get a

2819
01:48:13,618 --> 01:48:18,179
chance to to get to those points Matt in

2820
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:20,339
the future as well and so yeah again

2821

2827
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:33,359
now where I can't promise that I've

2828
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:36,179
actually seen every single question

2829
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:37,618
