1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,278
been on a table

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,240
and I've seen something removed from my

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,879
body

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,679
that I will call a fetus

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
a baby it was so small I couldn't

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,079
believe that it could live on its own

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,060
I remember putting my finger in the arch

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,379
of its foot I was afraid to look at the

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,059
face I was afraid to see what it looked

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,038
like there seems to be an enormous

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,839
interest in the emotional side of this

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
too and the part of the aliens they want

13
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,140
us to hold

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,660
these odd little children these babies

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,719
they want to see how a mother will hold

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,700
in love a child things which to us are

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,640
instinctive the abduction phenomenon

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,739
begins usually in infancy or at least by

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,159
the age of two three or four it

20
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,259
continues all through a childhood all

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,199
through maturity and into old age as

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,479
well I have many cases where the person

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,940
is taken as a child usually what we'd

24
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,619
refer to as the bedroom visitation I was

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,718
laying in bed I opened my eyes and

26
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,640
here's a little gray standing there

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,280
looking at me and all I could really

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,198
remember were those dark eyes it is as

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,760
if that person has become a kind of

30
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,140
tagged animal in someone else's

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,978
experiment

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,900
and that little person as they as he or

33
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,299
she grows to adulthood will be abducted

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,760
over a period of time at irregular

35
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,640
intervals let us assume

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,159
that this is all being made up that this

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,739
is internally generated that there is no

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,960
abduction phenomenon if that's the case

39
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,099
then we have discovered something of

40
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,099
enormous importance
