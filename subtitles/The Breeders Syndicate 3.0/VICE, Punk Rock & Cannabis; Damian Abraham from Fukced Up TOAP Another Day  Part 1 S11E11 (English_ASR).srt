Syndicate hey everyone welcome to Breer

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
Syndicate so this kind of rolls in as a

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,439
hot start with me and Damen Abraham um

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,120
for those you who don't know Damian is

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,439
from the band um God I guess it's the

24
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,000
first minute so I'll probably get in

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,718
trouble for cussing but it's [ __ ] up

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,039
the B [ __ ] up but he's also really

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,760
well known um for his work with Vice

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,558
magazine early on a lot of the

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,359
documentaries he's he's just a legend in

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,719
the punk rock scene and uh especially

31
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,640
for the historical part of the punk rock

32
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,519
scene he's also a major cannabis

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,680
Advocate and uh yeah we've been on each

34
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,079
other shows now and and I really wanted

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,159
to do one with him here um it's it's not

36
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,879
all punk rock based which I thought it

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,439
would probably be more punk rock based

38
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,000
and you know I understand a lot of

39
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:29,039
people that are in Kaa aren't

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,280
necessarily as interested in punk rock

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,799
but this one applies I think to everyone

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
and uh I think everyone's really going

43
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,360
to dig it absolutely loved it it was a

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,759
pleasure recording with him and with

45
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,599
that we kind of just slide right into

46
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,399
the conversation because that's how we

47
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:46,280
roll So yeah thank you so much I'm

48
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,439
drinking coffee I never drink coffee is

49
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,759
that is that to Edge or off edge I guess

50
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,438
so I don't know cannabis is my coffee I

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,159
feel like I I definitely uh if I didn't

52
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,398
smoke cannabis after the birth of my

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,039
children I don't know what it would have

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,439
got me through those sleepless nights I

55
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,159
think that was the uh that finally broke

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,719
my Edge to be honest really was that it

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,679
yeah it was that it was having kids

58
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,400
being on anxiety pill anti- anxiety

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,719
pills I should say um having to cycle on

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,959
and off them to get to be able to write

61
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,519
lyrics which is a side effect they don't

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,920
they don't bring that side effect up in

63
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,400
the uh Preamble no they don't yeah

64
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,719
depletes creativity yeah like I just I

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
don't know what it is but I guess it

66
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,598
just kind of like because it

67
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,878
you know mutes the highs and lows yeah

68
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,759
um it really I guess it's hard to get to

69
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,318
those places creatively at least for for

70
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,239
me and I'm sure there's lots of people

71
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:44,479
that find

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,120
it

73
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,399
completely pain free to write on anti-

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,400
anxiety pills and are are very creative

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,280
on it but that's not me you know I

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,560
definitely would have to cycle on and

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,519
off them and cycled off them and and

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,759
arrived in um

79
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,560
we were in in Holland we were in

80
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,518
Amsterdam or the Netherlands now right

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,920
Netherlands right yeah yeah Netherlands

82
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:14,799
sorry and uh and uh just was like can I

83
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,598
hit that joint that you guys got to my

84
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,760
band and they were all kind of

85
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,878
shocked uh they said I had broke Edge

86
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:24,199
before but I had not it was it was that

87
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:27,158
time and uh took it off the joint and

88
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,359
immediately kind of was like oh this is

89
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:32,759
what I was missing and I experimented

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,799
with Canabis in the the dirty 90s a

91
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,120
little bit when you know there were like

92
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,480
four I guess I don't even know different

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
types is what we knew him as we didn't

94
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,518
even know him as strains or as cultivars

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,039
right like it just like this guy's got

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,759
one that's like uh it it must be laced

97
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,280
with Coke because it's so strong and it

98
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,598
was just like really crystally I guess

99
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,560
like looking back on it now or there was

100
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,518
one guy it was like oh this guy's stuff

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,878
is is definitely lace because it's just

102
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,120
like so purple and yeah you know so I'd

103
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,000
experimented with cannabis I think I've

104
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,840
been stoned maybe once or twice

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
previously like I tried acid and that

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
was more my speed before I went straight

107
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,600
edge oh really yeah I really liked

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,720
psychedelics and yeah uh

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,400
cannabis like it was just so hit or miss

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,120
what you were getting back then and like

111
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,879
I didn't know how to inhale I was like I

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,759
think I'm getting it I think I'm getting

113
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,399
it the first time style yeah well first

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,199
first time I had my first cigarette my

115
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:37,439
first beer my first joint my first hit

116
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,560
of acid was all one day that's a lot

117
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,240
yeah how old were

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,399
you 14 yeah that's a good age for it

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,280
yeah yeah I've got a 15year old upstairs

120
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,159
right now so I gotta be very careful

121
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,159
listening on this conversation yeah

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,360
right we can get into that parenting

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,120
should with cannabis later on but uh

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,080
yeah so I tried it and came back and

125
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,439
told my doctor you know fast forward to

126
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,359
when I'm trying

127
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,000
as a 30-year-old and was like I found

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,560
something that works it take away my

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,038
anxiety and there's no side effects on

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,000
it like it's great you're not GNA

131
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:16,000
believe it it's weed and she's like no

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,639
way that is your doctor wasn't too

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,120
receptive not at all and this is like

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,918
this is

135
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,720
pre like Canada legalization came you

136
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,038
know obviously in a lot of different

137
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,639
phases but I think like the the leadup

138
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,639
to it there was sort of this like

139
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,719
medical Rush that kind of started where

140
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,199
all doctors got on board a lot of

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,120
doctors realized he get rich running

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
these cannabis clinics and my doctor

143
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,000
eventually kind of came around just

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,720
before that but it was only when I

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,839
started losing weight like I was a

146
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,000
hundred or so pounds heavier than I am

147
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,318
now yeah back then uh I would drink a

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,279
lot of soda that was my that'll do it

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,199
dude yeah I was drinking like six liters

150
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,799
a day Jesus

151
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:06,120
most on tour well see you wake up like

152
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,439
you have a large like I would have lar

153
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,240
you I would have two large sodas at

154
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,038
breakfast because I get a refill yeah uh

155
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,918
then at lunch and then backstage there's

156
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,318
always free soda oh I'm sure yeah and

157
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,758
then after the show we get some pops so

158
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,960
yeah it was it was pretty pretty severe

159
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,919
but yeah Tri cannabis got off all that

160
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:30,198
stuff and went off the anti-anxiety

161
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,560
pills against my doctor's orders and

162
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,079
uh once I started losing the weight

163
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,280
she's like okay I'll sign your your

164
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,399
forms for you to get into a Compassion

165
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:42,638
Club and at that point in Toronto there

166
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:46,159
were two compassion clubs one one was

167
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,038
pretty strict and you know like you had

168
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,919
to be signed in by a doctor the other

169
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,439
one if you knew the right people I think

170
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,719
youd get around the doctor thing but

171
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,279
this was definitely one of the ones that

172
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,479
you needed your doctor to really sign

173
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,959
off for you at and by that point i' had

174
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,120
already made some connections so I had

175
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,478
other hookups to get it from but the

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,959
Compassion Club was great because it

177
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,639
kind of gave me exposure to like a whole

178
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:12,120
new side of cannabis back then like it

179
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,879
it it it's so recent TimeWise but it was

180
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,160
just such a different world right like

181
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,039
pre medical pre-

182
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
legalization it was like a secret

183
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,759
society back then so what what initially

184
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,240
pushed you like from trying cannabis and

185
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,479
LSD and [ __ ] like that to going straight

186
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,918
edge like was it just the punk scene the

187
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,918
type of music you were listening to

188
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,478
people no I went I went kind of

189
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,758
straighted before all that I just kind

190
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,800
of hated everyone around me at school

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,319
yeah and uh not wanting to be like the

192
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,720
people around yeah like I think that's

193
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,919
also what prevented me from admitting

194
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,000
that I liked pro wrestling for so long

195
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,240
and I would kind of watch it in secret

196
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,680
because I hated the kids at my school

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,079
that were into wrestling and yeah yeah

198
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,519
for sure and it just felt like and also

199
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,918
it was like my parents

200
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,399
both smoked weed the whole time um off

201
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:06,439
and on with my dad he doesn't really

202
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,719
smoke weed now yeah at all but my my mom

203
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,959
secretly smoked weed and she was like I

204
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,479
tried it once I didn't like it and never

205
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,680
tried it again yeah uh so I think I

206
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,240
found like a real Rebellion like my dad

207
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,360
was like really freaked out by straight

208
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,720
edge and oh really yeah yeah I could see

209
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,598
that being a little rebellious too like

210
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,080
from nature kind of yeah like I think it

211
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,839
was the dogma of it I think it was the

212
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,399
fact that like why are you doing this

213
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,439
like normally when someone decides to be

214
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,200
sober it's because they've got a problem

215
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,039
or because their religion tells them or

216
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,479
you know to say like I'm just doing it

217
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:45,000
because I want to do it and then to be

218
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,160
kind of aggressive with it like like

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,080
Xing up before I went to his wedding and

220
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,799
stuff

221
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,320
weird like things that like you know

222
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,278
just obviously are attention getting you

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
realize as you're older but at the time

224
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,838
it it just is like this is important and

225
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,440
it really makes sense to me did really

226
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,760
make sense to me I'm I'm glad I was

227
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,120
straight edge when I was straightedge

228
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,120
and then I came back to cannabis just

229
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,919
the right time like swing plate rigs had

230
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,600
just kind of hit and extracts and

231
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,838
concentrates were just kind of coming

232
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,000
out

233
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,399
and obviously the medical wave was just

234
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,679
about to really start hitting in America

235
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,120
in sorry in Canada it already kind of

236
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:26,958
started I guess in California yeah um we

237
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,720
even though I recently read that we

238
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,919
actually had medical cannabis in Canada

239
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,278
first but it just such a shitty

240
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,399
program uh that that's probably right

241
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,039
too yeah yeah just stunted it for a long

242
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,958
time up here but that's why I guess we

243
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,199
had such great bud out in BC is because

244
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,039
everyone had these really um great

245
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,160
doctors that were signing him then them

246
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,879
into this medical program that was

247
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:53,519
really hard to get signed into back then

248
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:55,200
and um yeah like so I'm glad I was

249
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
certainly I wouldn't take back being

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
straight Ed at all but I I'm glad I got

251
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,239
into weed when I did because it was just

252
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,958
in time to kind of see the Roaring 20s

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,799
of cannabis just before uh you know

254
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,278
legalization changed everything not

255
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,479
necessarily in the most positive ways

256
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,799
all the time but changed everything

257
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,159
nonetheless so even being like straight

258
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,639
edge or identifying with straight edge

259
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,719
you were still in a band with people

260
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:21,600
that like used pot right yeah like yeah

261
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,200
you so it wasn't like super dogmatic

262
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,000
like Minor Threat era like no you would

263
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,560
have a really hard time I think in

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
Toronto

265
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,278
being dogmatic about that stuff not just

266
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,079
in the punk scene but I just think in in

267
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,600
general right like it's just it's a big

268
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,439
city and I think that kind of like

269
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,360
straight edge militancy probably works

270
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,160
when you're in a very small town or very

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,720
small you know where you can kind of

272
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,039
control things a lot more um but yeah

273
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,720
like it was never yeah I always had

274
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,679
friends that smoked and drank and I kind

275
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,160
of loved being around people that smoked

276
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,958
and drank and never really had a problem

277
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,958
with it in sort of outside myself kind

278
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,879
of way and I think now in in retrospect

279
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,638
I probably wouldn't have had a

280
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:10,720
problem with it myself if if I had been

281
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,759
doing it back then but I just you know

282
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,399
it was

283
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,559
a a good time for me not to be doing it

284
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,200
looking at some of my friends and some

285
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:22,278
of the sort of paths they went down sure

286
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,160
you know and it it was pre the cocaine

287
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,000
Revival and pre all that kind of stuff

288
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,719
but yeah still there was still obviously

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
lots of wildness being had in the late

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,440
90s

291
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,399
was there a big like a a heroin surge up

292
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,920
there in Canada for the punk scene there

293
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,320
was it's kind of been here the whole way

294
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,799
through we actually had there's a band

295
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
from up here called the bunch of [ __ ]

296
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,919
Goofs The BFG about them yeah yeah

297
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,919
they're like they're our band they're

298
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:50,439
like the legendary band I think every

299
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:53,120
scene kind of has the band that never

300
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,040
got out of the scene necessarily but if

301
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
you ask anyone that's around that scene

302
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,519
like who the most important band is the

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,360
bfgs came I guess 84 they

304
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,839
83 and really into the late late 90s

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,919
early 2000s they were still pretty

306
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,000
strong when they were going and so they

307
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,360
policed the scene they had Fort goof was

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,679
was their house and you talk to bands

309
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,519
that came through Toronto they all have

310
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,399
stories about going to Fort goof and

311
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,320
Jerry a tells a story about having like

312
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,320
some crazy open wound from the stage on

313
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,959
his leg and some dog licking it and them

314
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,120
being like no no no don't worry dogs

315
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,039
mouths are disinfectants it'll be fine

316
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,039
J's like really you think they're like

317
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,919
yeah

318
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:43,759
yeah got a crazy infection the next

319
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:46,519
day there's like but they because they

320
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:50,838
police the scene they big stances were

321
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:53,879
no hard drugs so no crack no heroin and

322
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,000
uh no Nazis yeah so because of that

323
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,559
there there obviously were these things

324
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,759
in and around Toronto but you just

325
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,638
didn't really see it around the punk

326
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,000
scene

327
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:06,560
yeah major and then with the arrival I

328
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,120
guess of oxie and then fentanyl that

329
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,399
changed everything and you really did

330
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,639
start deaths start happening in Toronto

331
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,559
and and these had happened before but I

332
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,680
think um for our Scene It was kind of

333
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,838
new when when fentanyl really started

334
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:22,559
hitting or oxies before that I guess

335
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,560
yeah it really did make it hardcore

336
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,638
available for everyone I always just

337
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,239
wondered like with um with Heroin how it

338
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,320
worked like up in Canada like the actual

339
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,600
trade of it and how it moved its way up

340
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,199
if it made like like the Mexican black

341
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,920
tar made it up that way and [ __ ] the

342
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,439
whole scenes up and and killed it off or

343
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,919
what because it definitely happens here

344
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,720
you know it's interesting there is

345
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,958
definitely like a pipeline that's

346
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,120
established between out west at West is

347
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,119
a is heroin OB like to Vancouver will

348
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,159
tell you right that opioids

349
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,120
have uh really wreak havoc on the

350
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,399
population in that City and uh you

351
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,159
really you see that beginning in the

352
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,799
punk scene like people have on turn it

353
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,719
to punk outed certain people as being

354
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:11,879
the the conduits for heroin arriving in

355
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,040
the punk scene oh there is a there was a

356
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,559
pipeline kind of established there was

357
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,519
this guy for more for for weed but there

358
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:22,719
was this guy uh Rosie who's the the hash

359
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,320
king of okay Toronto he was bringing in

360
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,079
tons and tons of hash and he got busted

361
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,639
and he was put on trial with Neil

362
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,000
Young's brother

363
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,198
and Norman maer testified in their

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,360
defense the day after he like won an o

365
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,120
or presented an Oscar oh that's wild and

366
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,600
they got like eight years for that but

367
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,639
yeah Rosie's story is wild like he but

368
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,440
he went out west and met the guys out

369
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,600
west which was a lot of dudes in bike

370
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,320
clubs uh a lot of guys that come up from

371
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,720
the States during the Vietnam war and

372
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
kind of afterwards and there had been a

373
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,560
lot of seeds and and genetics that have

374
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,440
come up through Canada at that point and

375
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,879
Rosie kind of brought the hash across

376
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,279
and they had the flower and that was

377
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,799
sort of the exchange for a while but

378
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:08,320
there was stuff coming up from like

379
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,000
Jamaican cess TR a ra rather large

380
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,360
Jamaican population or people from

381
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,519
Jamaica um and around that time there's

382
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,000
a lot of cth around here but people talk

383
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,720
about how great the hash was in Toronto

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,120
and then Rosie got busted the second

385
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,199
time he gets out of prison that first

386
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,759
time they he got busted with Neil

387
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,519
Young's brother and gets interviewed by

388
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,360
some reporter from Rolling Stone and the

389
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,480
reporter's like let's get the band back

390
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
together start smuggling hash and I'll

391
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,519
be in America you'll be in Canada it'll

392
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,360
be amazing so tempting so they do it

393
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,679
yeah they were bringing in tons and tons

394
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,159
of hash and

395
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,159
eventually you know the the the law

396
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,318
caught on to it and and there's this

397
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,000
whole wild story about tons of hash

398
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:54,919
being brought into New York and them

399
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,919
letting the sale go the CIA or something

400
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,599
letting the sale go through like deep

401
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,838
I'm probably messing up all the details

402
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
of it but anyway he gets busted again

403
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,480
and this time when Ros is on trial he

404
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,079
gets Neil Young to testify his defense

405
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,159
and Neil Young Young yeah because he's

406
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,679
famous or like [ __ ] he was busting

407
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,278
with his brother before right so he had

408
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,879
that familial connection and Neil looks

409
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,879
around the room and he's like I smoke

410
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,480
weed every day and I earn more money

411
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,600
than all you put together and they gave

412
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,519
Rosie like 28 years oh my God so so no

413
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,480
young didn't like uh pulling favors for

414
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,600
him no that's that's the celebrity name

415
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,199
drop you don't want yeah yeah it just

416
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,639
sounds like a circus like [ __ ] it

417
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,879
bringing no young just because we can

418
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,799
but Rosie was definitely like the

419
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,198
um the link for a lot of that stuff

420
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,919
going out west and I think a lot of that

421
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,359
sort of connection between out west and

422
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:53,198
out out here going back to you know the

423
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,639
70s yeah so one thing I do want to talk

424
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,278
about like early on is the new video

425
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,278
obviously because there there there

426
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,720
really isn't to me like anything

427
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,318
covering cannabis history in any

428
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,600
meaningful way uh in music like that

429
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,078
currently especially not in punk rock or

430
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,119
hardcore or any of it you know what I

431
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,198
mean like it's not it's not a normal

432
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,838
thing to see so I'm stoked on it and um

433
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,919
it's something I wanted to bring up and

434
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,279
and and make sure everybody gets to see

435
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,199
I don't even think we mentioned your

436
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,720
[ __ ] band yet no I kind of just

437
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,839

00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,480
yeah no you're you're fine dude yeah

441
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,279
they only get mad about like showing

442
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,160
plants for some reason hey don't worry I

443
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,720
wish I had some to show off but I I know

444
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,440
right have a post product um uh yeah the

445
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,839
video was was am thank you again

446
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,600
publicly for your help on this because

447
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,599
um it's something I wanted

448
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,959
to I think it's

449
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,678
just I'm I'm fascinated by history of

450
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,079
stuff and and and once I kind of get

451
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,919
into something I want to really kind of

452
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:02,399
get into it and and figure it out out

453
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,240
and I think with cannabis there's just

454
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,440
so

455
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,679
many false paths that you can wind up

456
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,558
going down and there's just so much

457
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,960
false information that's out there that

458
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,798
digging in and talking to people that

459
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,679
that know about the plant that have

460
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,839
experience with the plan and you know so

461
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,080
like not to put you over on your own

462
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,359
[ __ ] but like someone like yourself

463
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,279
who's actually like put in the work yeah

464
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,798
like that's it's like kind of invaluable

465
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,240
because it's not really something you

466
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,359
can pick up a book there's so many books

467
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,599
that you can pick up that are full of

468
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,439
disinformation and misinformation and

469
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,279
and to kind of like put all those pieces

470
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,679
together it's uh you really do rely on

471
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,839
people that have been kind of putting

472
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,000
this puzzle together before you to kind

473
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,798
of help you figure it out and Yeah like

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,159
it's just trying to pay tribute to this

475
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,839
amazing plant that I've had a

476
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,520
relationship with now

477
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:58,038
for like I guess 15 years yeah really

478
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,839
intensely but has been around for

479
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:02,480
millennia and has been involved in The

480
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:05,879
Human Experience for Millennia and it's

481
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,720
just so misunderstood and even when it's

482
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,880
not being vilified I think it's being

483
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,919
misunderstood like every time I buy

484
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,320
cannabis I get asked IND sativa and yeah

485
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,720
right yeah I guess it's an

486
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,839
icebreaker not all it is anymore yeah

487
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,880
yeah but like the idea that this plant

488
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:28,439
knows though this plant like as it's

489
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,720
growing is okay I got to make sure I

490
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,440
present present this trait of myself

491
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,319
that makes this person want to watch

492
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,798
Netflix and eat ice cream like there's

493
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,359
nothing in nature that would make a

494
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,240
plant want to do that to you so why is

495
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,319
this person thinking that that's gonna

496
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,919
have or trying to tell me that it's

497
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,759
gonna have that kind of effect on me

498
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,480
yeah and I just it feels like there's a

499
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,319
lot of silliness around cannabis and not

500
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,880
that our video is not silly in its own

501
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,558
way but I wanted like in amongst the

502
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,919
silliness to have some like actual real

503
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:03,399
information yeah about it yeah so what

504
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,840
was like the inspiration for doing it

505
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,120
right now versus even 10 years ago

506
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,119
[ __ ] up with let me like the band

507
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,798
finally all kind of just signed off on

508
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:15,119
it yeah the band signed off on it I

509
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:18,000
guess we have on our last record we have

510
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,000
a song uh called Lords of Kensington

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,558
which is about this neighborhood in

512
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,558
Toronto called Kensington

513
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:27,798
Market which at one point was a uh a

514
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,200
market kind of area for recently arrived

515
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,240
people from Eastern Europe and then

516
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,919
people recently arrived from China and

517
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,720
Hong Kong and Taiwan and then just sort

518
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,559
of in the 990s it became a place with

519
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,240
lots of thrift stores and still lots of

520
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,599
food markets and things like that but it

521
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,440
was a a cool neighborhood and we had a a

522
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,199
bunch of neat little venues in there

523
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,159
like um HMA or the anarchist free space

524
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
where you could kind of just put on

525
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,360
shows in the basement and buy records or

526
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,520
whatever yeahh so the song's kind of

527
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,240
reflecting on that neighborhood and the

528
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,359
changes in that neighborhood and

529
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,319
the fact that there was this park in

530
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,158
this neighborhood um that's still there

531
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,200
and that Park was where kids would

532
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:10,520
always go and just smoke weed and there

533
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,519
was a lot of people selling weed and

534
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,599
then cops got wise to it and would go

535
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,200
down and fake sell weed to kids and TR

536
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,519
kids and and [ __ ] up kids lies and then

537
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,798
in one of the kind of the grossest

538
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,359
displays of post

539
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,158
legalization uh cannabis in Canada this

540
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,038
the former police chief of Toronto

541
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,520
Julian in

542
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,960
fantino who indirectly probably directly

543
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,359
too during his time as a cop is

544
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,440
responsible for like thousands of lives

545
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:43,000
being [ __ ] up by canvas

546
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,720
laws uh putting out like an editorial

547
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,440
about how he had changed his mind about

548
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,720
cannabis finally go figure when there's

549
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,720
money on the table cop changed his mind

550
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,798
about

551
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,558
weed and opened a weed store in

552
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,599
Kensington Market and so I wrote a song

553
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,519
on the last record about that and um on

554
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,879
this record it's kind of like a a

555
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,720
fantasy of a kid who had been arrested

556
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,880
by a cop going down and watching the

557
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,600
cops weedster grow to business and and

558
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,039

559
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,158

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,320
of our band by far has he been in since

593
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,798
the the beginning is it like all the

594
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,038
members always been in the band or yeah

595
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,639
I was the last one to join they did

596
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,079
really four four shows with uh Josh as

597
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,240
the singer the guy who plays guitar in

598
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,558
the band now and then he went to

599
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,919
trainhop uh down in the US so punk rock

600
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,720
it was pre September 11th when you could

601
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,480
still kind of train hop AC the border

602
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,120
and uh so he train hopped down there in

603
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,440
in the states and they had three shows

604
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,278
lined up and they were like do you want

605
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,240
to sing these three shows and I sang

606
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:01,519
them

607
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,720
and we had fun and so when Josh came

608
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,960
back uh Mike from [ __ ] up was like

609
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,558
you're just going to learn guitar and

610
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,600
daman's going to be the singer now and

611
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,319
that's what it's kind of been weirdly

612
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,879
ever since I don't think any of us I

613
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,278
think every stage of [ __ ] up has felt

614
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,600
like the last so yeah I don't think

615
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:22,159
anyone in the band thought it would be

616
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:24,359
like this at all how many years has the

617
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,039
band been running

618
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,119
24 that's so long dude for for people to

619
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,798
get along enough to be in a van and oh

620
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,479
we don't get along oh we don't get along

621
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:37,158
at

622
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,480
all that's just how it goes yeah I it's

623
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,039
it's funny when we were like I remember

624
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,278
one of the first big festivals we played

625
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:47,759
was tea in the park in in Edinburgh and

626
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:51,839
uh rag machine showed up and each one

627
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:54,960
was in a separate Sprinter van M and

628
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,359
it's like oh my God like how bad does it

629
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,798
have to be that you can't even sit in

630
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,278
the same van as the rest of the people

631
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,679
in your band

632
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,038
and not that we have the means for it

633
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,320
and [ __ ] up but if we did have the

634
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,879
means I'm sure we would all be in

635
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:09,720
separate spinner bands

636
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,760
now guarantee that's so funny dude so

637
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,000
let's let's talk about um your Vice era

638
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,079
yeah things that you did with Vice uh

639
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,480
specifically for cannabis also with the

640
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:22,439
wrestlers because that's like something

641
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,480
I was fascinated with it was um yeah it

642
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,159
was wild like how did that even come to

643
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,319
be oh

644
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,720
man uh

645
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,639
you like you want the whole Vice Saga

646
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,440
for beginning yeah why not why not all

647
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,000
right maybe let me let me do my uh [ __ ]

648
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,679
my dab first and then get really into it

649
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,200
because this is like a like it's

650
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,600
interesting like the history of Vice

651
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,278
when you when you really start breaking

652
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,959
it my friend was like whatever you do

653
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,720

that [ __ ] hot no exactly like I

682
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:08,079
realized that every dab I had taken

683
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,079
before had been way too hot

684
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:24,319
yeah all right now I'm

685
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:27,839

686
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,918
was in grade nine and 10 called Ur in

687
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,519
trouble

688
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,480
okay and the first show the second show

689
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,960
we ever played afterwards we went to a

690
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,319
restaurant that was open super late and

691
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
walking in they would have all like the

692
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,038
free newspapers and things like that and

693
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,798
Toronto being a big city we had a lot of

694
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,759
free weeklys and and other papers back

695
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,119
then and I saw this one with a Frank

696
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:52,480
khaak picture on the cover of a dog with

697
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,278
a machine gun I love khaak rest in peace

698
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,159
and I was a huge absolutely rest in

699
00:27:54,278 --> 00:28:00,599
peace someone who I think yeah we could

700
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,440
do a whole podcast you oh for sure um so

701
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,678
I was like oh my God Frank kic and they

702
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,919
had an article about propagandhi I

703
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,038
remember in that issue and something

704
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,519
else and it was called voice back then

705
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:14,558
and I picked it up and I'm like this is

706
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,399
really cool and then it became vice

707
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,200
really shortly thereafter and it was

708
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,079
still like a newsprint thing that youd

709
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,840
pick up and had the dos and don'ts and

710
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,918
it was talking about garage Rock in

711
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,119
Montreal and they they kept talking

712
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,759
about this record label they were

713
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,639
starting back then called SSG records

714
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:32,240
and they were going to be putting out

715
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,640
all these records and it just seemed

716
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,919
right even then super cool like it was

717
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,480
talking about Punk it was talking about

718
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:42,840
rap music it had cool comics in it it

719
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,440
was and it was really well written and

720
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,000
yeah there was just something about it

721
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,440
and so I just kind of like I picked it

722
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,038
up every month after that like it was

723
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,080
just something you you grabbed you like

724
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,278
you go to the record store and they're

725
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,720
like oh the new issue of Vice is here I

726
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:01,119
I've got one that's got like a l flexi

727
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,880
in it with bis the bis Marquee song that

728
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:07,839
they did with Len that came in one issue

729
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:12,120
of Vice like it was just part of like my

730
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:16,839
youth and so we start [ __ ] up like

731
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:18,639
years later and uh we get weirdly out of

732
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,519
the blue one day we get an email from a

733
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,200
guy named Andy kapper who was the editor

734
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:27,759
of Vice UK at the time and he's like um

735
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,880
a friend of mine told me about your band

736
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,119
I think you gu I like your band and he's

737
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,559
like I want to do something with you

738
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,038
guys and so Mike from [ __ ] up was like

739
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,798
you should put out a a seven inch why

740
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:41,200
don't you put it a seven inch on Vice

741
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:42,398
records and uh he did but didn't clear

742
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,080
it with the rest of Vice so it's kind of

743
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,239
a bootleg on Vice records that's so

744
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:49,918
awesome uh and then at the same time

745
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,640
Arty Philly who played in a bunch of

746
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,960
great hardcore bands over the years uh

747
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,080
was who was a writer for vice like that

748
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,558
was the thing about Vice like right from

749
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,759
the get-go there was tons of punk and

750
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,839
hardcore people writing for it or

751
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,240
involved in it and you you kind of

752
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,959
always knew people that new people that

753
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,640
were in it or this guy from this band's

754
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,798
now writing for him or the guy from the

755
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,640
space shits does these reviews or you

756
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,158

757
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,120
Arty Philly who was writing for them at

758
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,200
the time and played in all these

759
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,479
hardcore bands hit us in career suicide

760
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,240
up and was like can I interview you guys

761
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
for

762
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,640
vice and we both sent our you know

763
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,759
answers back to the questions

764
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,720
and then he's like can you guys send

765
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,720
some photos and Martin from Kur suicide

766
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,839
never sent photos but I had some photos

767
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,679
that a friend of mine had taken uh of me

768
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,759
bleeding from the head yeah dude a show

769
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,038
legendary photos out there well that was

770
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,960
the thing you know like that was the

771
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:49,440
vice went with that photo and that was I

772
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,798
think what made the P yeah probably that

773
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,840
photo in Vice

774
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:57,319
magazine uh and then from there they

775
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,398
wanted to sign us and we didn't sign we

776
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,960
end up signing a Mador and there was a

777
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:05,079
lot of drama and it was not great for a

778
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,798
couple years it was it was so bizarre

779
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:10,079
because it was like something that I'd

780
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,918
grown up with like it would be like if

781
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,000
uh all of a sudden Spider-Man had beef

782
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,759
with you or Marvel Comics had beef with

783
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,319
you yeah right where I'm like this is so

784
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,119
[ __ ] weird and by this point Gavin

785
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,678
was long out of the pitcher it was more

786
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,439
with the other people that were left

787
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,440
there and it was it was weird and then

788
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,600
they came Vice Canada was kind of part

789
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,000
of the

790
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,038
company but like the Kinder gentler

791
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,119
version of Vice like the the Canadian

792
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,720
version exactly which is weird because

793
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:44,879
Vice is ultimately started by a bunch of

794
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,679
[ __ ] yeah from Canada but but still

795
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,360
the vice office in Toronto was

796
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,480
definitely like the Canadian version of

797
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,038
Vice like everyone was a lot friendlier

798
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,558
and a lot Kinder and I think if you look

799
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,558
at the content that they put out a lot

800
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:58,359
of it was like a lot of it had a lot

801
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:00,038
more

802
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,278
heart than a lot of the US stuff that

803
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:05,000
was coming around at the same time but

804
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,278
at that time it was still just like a

805
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,599
fledgling operation up here in the

806
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,079
Toronto office like they had just

807
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,439
started opening these satellite offices

808
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:15,278
and the Toronto office was pretty new

809
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,798
and they came to me and they were like

810
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,159
we want to do uh a thing about Budweiser

811
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:21,440
a thing about bands where you go around

812
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,480
and interview bands and it's gonna be

813
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,240
sponsored by Budweiser beer and I had

814
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,558
briefly been a VJ on much music which is

815
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:33,919
the Canadian MTV and just spent the last

816
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:37,720
two years interviewing terrible bands

817
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,200
about music and was like I don't drink

818
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,240
so being sponsored by Budweiser was

819
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,798
weird to me yeah I bet and uh I I also

820
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,079
just don't want to interview bands and

821
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,200
they're like well we're looking on to do

822
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:54,119
a medical cannabis documentary too and

823
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:58,038
I'm like perfect I just got medical weed

824
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,918
and we uh went out to BC and shot the

825
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:02,558
Canadian cannabis documentary the very

826
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,278
first one and it did really well for

827
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,319
vice Canada on YouTube that was when

828
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,919
Vice YouTube channel was still really

829
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,918
popping or just starting to really pop

830
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,278
and so we end up doing another four more

831
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,919
of these documentaries and uh it was

832
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,240
unbelievable the experiences were really

833
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,600
great I met some great friends that I'm

834
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,679
still super tight with today and friends

835
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,599
for life making these documentaries and

836
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,798
really got to kind of see

837
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:35,480
like the real side of cannabis BC

838
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,558
where and I'm sure it's still huge the

839
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,720
stuff but that felt like kind of the

840
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:43,200
crest like it felt like the Roaring 20s

841
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,360
like there was just 200 plus

842
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,399
dispensaries in downtown Vancouver there

843
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,199
was like five times more dispensaries

844
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,158
than Tim Horton's I think we said in one

845
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,399
of the documentaries some some crazy

846
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,039
number of these dispensaries and every

847
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,719
one of these dispensaries had a lounge

848
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:02,398
upstairs with where people would just go

849
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,159
and do dabs and hang out all of them

850
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,079
were packed all of them looked like they

851
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,079
were turning a profit like it really did

852
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:12,319
feel like [ __ ] this is what it should be

853
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,039
like yeah and it's weird how post

854
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,119
legalization that hasn't come back in

855
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,960
any way and there there is obviously

856
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,838
tons

857
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,480
of money being made by some people in

858
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,159
the Cannabis industry but it seems to be

859
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,719
like a race to the bottom and that

860
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,720
wasn't the case back then

861
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,320
but but I'm glad I got to see it like I

862
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,159
and I I I really did realize it at the

863
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,960
time like I remember the day

864
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,919
legalization happened sitting there with

865
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,280
a bunch of friends having aesh being

866
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,638
like I think this is it I think we saw

867
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,760
the best [ __ ] that happened in weed

868
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,559
because they' already the cops had

869
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,280
already raided all the dispensaries by

870
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:55,960
that point and you could already tell

871
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,960
that there was a change coming that yeah

872
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,119
was you know I I don't know thought it

873
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,599
was going to be as severe as it was but

874
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,720
uh and

875
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,320
vice by that point it already kind of

876
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,159
transitioned to making the wrestling

877
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,559
content by the time visualization hit

878
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,679
but they were already like we had so

879
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,679
much Goodwill with people on the

880
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,719
traditional the traditional side of the

881
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:21,039
market or the the Legacy Market I should

882
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:24,679
say yeah uh that they just kind of

883
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:27,679
eroded immediately they made a deal with

884
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:29,279
canopy to do some branded content

885
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,919
content

886
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,280
and everyone was bummed out naturally I

887
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,119
remember that watching the first piece

888
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,960
of content they made and it was not it

889
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,160
was like an ad it wasn't a documentary

890
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,800
of course and then it cuts to the end

891
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:46,519
and because they weren't allowed to show

892
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:49,039
people consuming in advertorial content

893
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,000
so you can see that she's clearly

894
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,159
rolling up like a cigarette that they

895
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,920
cut away from before she like puts it in

896
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,279
her mouth to kind of be like well legal

897
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,838
weed's

898
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,960
awesome and yeah it was great though

899
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:03,039
there was a bunch of times they tried to

900
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,400
get rid of me and bring in a younger

901
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,358
person because that's what Vice was

902
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,599
ultimately you know running on the blood

903
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,239
of the youth yeah and they'd bring in

904
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:13,400
these younger reporters and they might

905
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,639
be better reporters than me but by God

906
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,280
did they not have the tolerance and so I

907
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,000
one by one they would all just fall as

908
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,960
they'd have to go to these sessions with

909
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,079
glass blowers or Growers or genetics

910
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,920
people or just like you know people that

911
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:33,240
can smoke yeah and they would be under

912
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,440
the table passed out taking home and

913
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:39,919
they'd have to call me

914
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,720
Grandpa back yeah that was my one

915
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,960
natural ability that kept me employed at

916
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,639
Vice for so long was my tolerance

917
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,199
actually no I forgot there's one another

918
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:53,759
big thing that happened was um Vice had

919
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:56,598
their like 20th anniversary party and uh

920
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,119
was the 20th I guess it was 20th and

921
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,280
they flew

922
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,358
they're like hey uh they suou from Vice

923
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,319

924
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,639

925
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:06,159
and this is before I started making

926
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,920
documentaries for him or any of that

927
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,480
stuff this is like the beginning of the

928
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,838
kind of thaw and the the Cold War yeah

929
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,199
and uh I was like sure sure and he's

930
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:16,078
like okay you're gonna be doing a thing

931

958
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:27,760
keyboards and Jonah Hill covering like

959
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:29,399
Marvin's Room on on the microphone like

960
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,160
sounds like a bad Acid trip but kind of

961
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,838
nice so nuts it was so wild uh it was

962
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,920
and but after that they gave me a vice

963
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:41,039
ring and I got it

964
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,838
here and this was like have you seen

965
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,960
that Seinfield episode where Kramer gets

966
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,119
the Tony somehow yeah yeah yeah that's

967
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,679
what this ring was like like I all of

968
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,680
sudden had this ring and it was like I

969
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,519
was in the Masons like I never had to

970
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,679
sign in for security at Vice Canada I

971
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,039
think it's because no one really

972
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,919
understood

973
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,719
what the ring was in Canada it was like

974
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,599
the satellite office so they thought it

975
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:09,199
just meant maybe executive or something

976
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,519
you're locked in oh it was crazy the the

977
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,480

that's so cool I love Vice he's like you

1025
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,680
the ring pre- ring oh I did have my ring

1026
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,920
I did have my ring I don't if I had it

1027
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:08,039
on me though it was just very bizarre

1028
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,760
like the power that thing had for a hot

1029
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,279
moment it's it's wild and I guess we're

1030
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,800
seeing it now with Drake too like how

1031
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,200
quickly culture can change but yeah when

1032
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,119
we started making that wrestling TV show

1033
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:25,919
The Till the End like at the beginning

1034
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,519
Vice was a sacred word you could you

1035
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,880
know you just utter Vice and people are

1036
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,719
willing to help you out in any way they

1037
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,599
could sure to when we were finished

1038
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,559
where it was like oh I [ __ ] hate Vice

1039
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,079
or I used to watch Vice and it's like

1040
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,078
yeah eight

1041
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:43,279
months so so was the wrestling show as

1042
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,079
big as the weed show like with as far as

1043
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,400
views and [ __ ] it's kind of hard to say

1044
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:52,079
like I still don't even really know like

1045
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,880
the way it went down so Vice can had

1046
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,200
this huge $500 million deal from Rogers

1047
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,838
which is the big cable provider here MH

1048
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:03,480
and at a certain point Rogers just wrote

1049
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:06,199
off the investment and said you can just

1050
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,559
keep keep the money that we've paid you

1051
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:11,679
so far and keep all your content we

1052
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,599
don't want it which I really think was

1053
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,799
the beginning of the dominoes falling

1054
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,359
for vice yeah in terms of business deals

1055
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,160
beginning to go south and everything

1056
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:23,400
kind of beginning to change

1057
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,000
so we were part of that Rogers deal like

1058
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,480
we were one of the last shows they green

1059
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,239
lit under that Rogers deal where they

1060
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,480
had money to kind of spend on these kind

1061
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:35,719
of TV shows so we had a decent budget I

1062
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,159
didn't see a lot of that decent budget

1063
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,358
making that show solid a decent budget

1064
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:40,598
but we got to spend a lot of money

1065
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:43,000
making that show like it's crazy looking

1066
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,599
back on it and and that's why we were

1067
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,280
able to travel to all those places that

1068
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,640
we were able to travel and and do all

1069
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,920
these those sorts of things was because

1070
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:54,239
this Rogers deal which then evaporated

1071
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,519
in the process of making that show which

1072
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,358
left our show kind of in limbo yeah Vice

1073
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,800
had changed directions Vice also never

1074
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:04,639
really believed in in wrestling which is

1075
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,839
interesting now with the success they've

1076
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,960
had with dark side of the Ring yeah oh

1077
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,719
right yeah yeah that kind of and they

1078
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,280
were in production just after we went

1079
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,159
into production and that also started in

1080
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,319
Canada their production too uh but

1081
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,639
someone ADV Vice like an executive

1082
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,159
straight up told me like no one cares

1083
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,598
about wrestling I'm like there's

1084
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:22,960
millions of people watching it every

1085
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,039
week clearly one of their biggest shows

1086
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,800
yeah and then dark of the Ring became

1087
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:28,838
their biggest show that was Dave zero

1088
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,160
Maddy

1089
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:34,000
Matson and uh and that I think are their

1090
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,838
big success stories of of kind of the

1091
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,039
vice TV experiment where did the

1092
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,719
therapist show come in there oh that was

1093
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,759
when we were making the wrestling show

1094
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,279
and that came about because Andy kapper

1095
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,599
was like Hey I'm doing this show where

1096
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,440
you just come in and talk to this

1097
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,440
therapist guy and I'm like okay well how

1098
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,039
bad could that be I'm on tour and he's

1099
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,358
like yeah we'll pay you like 500 bucks

1100
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,318
for the two hours I'm like can I smoke

1101
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,719
weed he's like

1102
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:04,199
sure which I don't think

1103
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:07,000
isal I don't think you're allowed to

1104
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:09,598
give therapy to someone who's uh not

1105
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,800
that I would ever not be yeah high on

1106
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,240
weed but like I think on an Ethics level

1107
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,920
the fact that this therapist knew that

1108
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:20,279
might be a weird conflict but it was

1109
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,000
very [ __ ] weird and it is so intense

1110
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,599
and that was an intense show even

1111
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,280
watching it it's super intense that my

1112
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,559
mom made me cut out a lot of stuff got

1113
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,200
an early cut of it and I sent it to my

1114
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,800
mom and she's like can you cut out all

1115
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:36,799
this [ __ ] about your stepfather and so

1116
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,480
they really dialed that side of it back

1117
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,760
but they got me to say [ __ ] on the

1118
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,559
record that I never never want to talk

1119
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,000
about and yeah and you're there and I

1120
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:52,280

00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,199
show in a lot of ways like professional

1137
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,200
year of my life sure

1138
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:39,078
because every day was interesting every

1139
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:42,598
day was was cool but the amount of

1140
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:45,599
travel was very intense we were gone I

1141
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:47,039
was gone for two weeks every two weeks

1142
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,400
yeah and then sometimes it' be like a

1143
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,358
month in

1144
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,280
Japan sometimes it was like yeah a month

1145
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,960
in Japan bro it was awesome no weed but

1146
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,519
oh yeah that's right I had a couple

1147
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,119
opportunities to smoke but I'm like I

1148
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,639
don't think I'd enjoy it what kind of

1149
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:07,160
mids they got in Japan back then you can

1150
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,358
get well obviously I'm talking to a guy

1151
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:12,279
when for most people you can get Cali

1152
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,598
quality weed there like you know

1153
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,200
obviously shop shop level I was gonna

1154
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,119
say for the rest of the world like top

1155
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:24,159
weed but it was at the time I was told

1156
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:26,960
$80 a gram $90 a gram [ __ ] yeah that's

1157
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,920
why Thailand Thailand legalization looks

1158
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,599
so attractive to tourists because people

1159
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,358
are coming from Russia and Japan where

1160
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:38,240
to pay for that California stuff you're

1161
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:40,400
you're paying you know $90 a gram $80 a

1162
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,598
gram so to pay $40 a gram doesn't seem

1163
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,480
that bad

1164
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,039
yeah but I uh yeah it was too rich for

1165
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,199
my blood so I just stayed away from weed

1166
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:52,639
the whole time actually that year I

1167
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:56,558
smoked weed in Mexico a few

1168
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:58,000
times uh I smoked weed in Bolivia um but

1169
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,960
it was

1170
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,719
it was not the greatest cannabis in my

1171
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,559
experience the cocoa leaves though were

1172
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:10,358
that be yeah yeah yeah I definitely have

1173
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,920
never never been an upper person but uh

1174
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:14,279
chewing a bag of cocoa leaves really

1175
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,720
helped me deal with the altitude Chang

1176
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,359
bet it was bet but yeah I'm trying to

1177
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,639
think of other places that there would

1178
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,318
be because wrestlers a lot of wrestlers

1179
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,920
smoke weed so when you're around the

1180
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:29,199
wrestlers there's always cannabis kind

1181
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,920
of around um but yeah it was it was uh

1182
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,159
it was an intense year but an amazing

1183
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,519
year there's like so much [ __ ] there's

1184
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,078
just obviously

1185
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:39,000
like getting to see some of these places

1186
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,200
realizing like and I think cannabis and

1187
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,159
wrestling are the same in this way they

1188
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:47,639
cross social lines in the way that punk

1189
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:49,519
never really does yeah you know like

1190
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:52,558
you'll see cannabis and wrestling in

1191
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:55,199
places that have no punk scene or or

1192
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,800
maybe a very tiny Punk scene

1193
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:01,039
and yeah there was uh it was really cool

1194
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,200
to kind of like think about this the

1195
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,759
wrestling show basically it was this

1196
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,318
sort of idea that wrestling everywhere

1197
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,760
it goes it's going to be like a type of

1198
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:11,558
music and it's going to adapt to the

1199
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,280
local culture and that's why Lucha Libre

1200
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:17,440
and Japanese Strong

1201
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,000
Style have very little physically in

1202
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,639
common with each other and their their

1203
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,039
performance of professional wrestling or

1204
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,318
the the execution of professional

1205
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:25,719
wrestling but at the same time it's a

1206
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,558
language that you could stick these two

1207
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:28,679
guys in the ring together or two people

1208
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:29,920
in the ring together and they'd still be

1209
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,960
able to figure out how to have a match

1210
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,880
with each other and getting to see that

1211
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,599
bore out like the people in Bolivia or

1212
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,480
the people in kinasa and the people in

1213
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:42,119
ninic and everyone kind of spoke the

1214
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,039
same language of of pro wrestling that's

1215
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,960
so wild yeah because I'm a I'm a big

1216
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,719
Mark for like um New Japan Pro Wrestling

1217
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,559
like all that stuff like but mostly

1218
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:54,318
because of how it intertwined with MMA

1219
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:56,798
in Japan yeah and and you'd find these

1220
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:59,239
people doing these uh you know

1221
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,199
choreographed acts and then you know a

1222
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:03,358
year later they're in real fights real

1223
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:06,558
submission fights and just as tough as

1224
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:10,440
anyone else you know yeah like the uh

1225
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:14,798
uwfi and and Pancras and sort of that

1226
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:17,519
and um big Japan and and

1227
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:20,318
uh in all Japan and in New Japan as well

1228
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:23,559
like the the way the like I think it's

1229
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,960
Terry Funk described it in in a podcast

1230
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,440
I think he did with Cole Cabana where

1231
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,519
like wrestling

1232
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,920
you know if you look at the history of

1233
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,838
professional wrestling in Japan it's

1234
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,798
there prior to the second world war they

1235
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,119
think it was brought over by Masons and

1236
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:40,039
it was sort of like just part of like

1237
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:42,200
gambling culture like the idea of like

1238
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,440
fixing wrestling matches yeah

1239
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,480
performance of wrestling but it's not

1240
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,880
until after the second world war and and

1241
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,639
Ricky dozan this former sumo wrestler

1242
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,599
who uh according to what I've read

1243
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,960
couldn't uh arise past a certain rank in

1244
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:01,640
Sumo because he was part Korean or had a

1245
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,760
Korean mother I believe so kind of hit a

1246
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:08,400
ceiling in Sumo came over to wrestling

1247
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,880
and and Japan sort of freshly removed

1248
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,519
from the second world war he realized

1249
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,519
what people wanted to see in Japan was

1250
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,358
Japanese people fighting

1251
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:18,639
Americans and so they started bringing

1252
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:20,159
in these American guys and because

1253
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,440
they're one generation removed from

1254
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,318
armed conflict a lot of times these guys

1255
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,639
would get in the ring and they just

1256
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:27,279
tried and kill each other and Terry

1257
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,719
Terry FK Terry funk's like in America

1258
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,760
you're trying to make a work look like a

1259
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:33,558
Shute in Japan you're trying to make a

1260
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,079
chute look like a work because we go out

1261
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,880
there [ __ ] kill each other that's

1262
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,160
that's wild but it's it's it's funny how

1263
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,838
that became the style right to this day

1264
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:45,358
that's what strong style is and that's

1265
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:46,960
why Japanese wrestling so that's what I

1266
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,119
love too is because like these guys are

1267
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,358
going in there and they're or people are

1268
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,160
going in there um and just being the

1269
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:58,159
[ __ ] out of each other and and it's very

1270
00:50:54,159 --> 00:51:00,118
physical and it's very snug and yeah and

1271
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,239
very like and then yeah at a certain

1272
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,838
point I guess people were just like yeah

1273
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,439
what what we fought for

1274
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:09,199
real right what really happened like we

1275
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,240
really just like didn't bother you know

1276
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,519
deciding who was going to win in advance

1277
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:15,639
and yeah what that

1278
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,880
brings and if you look at like a lot of

1279
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:20,078
the early I guess even UFC guys a lot of

1280
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,160
them had experience or training in

1281
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,920
Japanese proest yeah yeah and that's

1282
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,239
probably why a lot of them were able to

1283
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,880
kind of you know

1284
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,159
become the Stars they were is because

1285
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,640
they knew what people wanted to see in

1286
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:35,078
the ring and they knew what they the

1287
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,759
fans needed from their physical combat

1288
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:38,000
and yeah and they also had the Charisma

1289
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,839
you know what I mean that's like a big

1290
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,480
part of selling yourself in any fight

1291
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:45,358
yeah yeah it was uh yeah it was

1292
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,838
interesting in kind of like going around

1293
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:50,960
and realizing that there's like sort of

1294
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,358
this Universal quality to people that

1295
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,559
wind up being pro wrestlers like not

1296
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,759
every not to say that everyone's the

1297
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,480
exact same but there's and then there's

1298
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,319
a universal quality of people that wind

1299
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,599
up being wrestling

1300
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,400
fans that's funny and they're not

1301
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,519
necessarily the same types of people

1302
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,960
yeah and it was it was interesting

1303
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:13,400
because it's closer to cannabis in this

1304
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,199
way that it is a secret thing and for

1305
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,960
different reasons I guess maybe way back

1306
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:21,358
when when it was still being fixed in

1307
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,240
terms of gambling stuff it was for kind

1308
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,719
of the same reasons you got to keep it

1309
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:28,439
secret but you really don't like the

1310
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,239
fans in wrestling it's not like punk

1311
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:34,079
where it's like hey you kid come up here

1312
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:36,199
anybody can do this [ __ ] yeah it's like

1313
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,640
hey you kid come in the ring I [ __ ]

1314
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,358
dare you I'm gonna break your arm this

1315
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,719
is real

1316
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:46,279
yeah like one thing I learned very

1317
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,519
quickly is never let a wrestler

1318
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,000
demonstrate uh a move on you or

1319
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:54,199
demonstrate something on you and I knew

1320
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,280
this going in but the first thing I made

1321
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:57,639
prior to the wrestlers because rice kept

1322
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,599
me like no you can't make anything about

1323
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:01,679
wrestling no one cares about wrestling

1324
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,240
and then I did this documentary about

1325
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,519
Deathmatch wrestling with this director

1326
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:08,519
Shaunie who was amazing director and we

1327
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,559
went down to the tournament of death in

1328
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:14,199
Delaware do you know about this thing

1329
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,519
uhuh no T Tournament of death is this

1330
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:19,439
annual I believe they're still doing it

1331
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:23,000
wrestling event put on by czw on the

1332
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:27,079
owner oh the CZ W1 okay and the owner DJ

1333
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,318
Hy's parents yeah parent yeah what yeah

1334
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:33,559
and we went out there and we filmed and

1335
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:35,159
it was it was nuts and I kept selling it

1336
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,359
to Vice we've been I've been trying to

1337
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:38,519
make this documentary with them for

1338
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:41,880
years on this thing I'm like you will

1339
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:43,960
not believe how crazy this is yeah and I

1340
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,599
brought it back and they just could not

1341
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,760
believe how out of control all the

1342
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,079
violence in this thing was and and that

1343
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,920
was the first thing that sold them

1344
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,920
because it did so well on YouTube and

1345
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,358
and and and finally kind of like made

1346
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,240
them realize that people actually care

1347
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:02,039
about wrestling but that I still have

1348
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,838
nightmares that was definitely the

1349
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:06,558
wildest shoot ever and the most insane

1350
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,960
people to deal with yeah yeah I I

1351
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,200
remember seeing that episode or that

1352
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,318
that whole thing it was nuts yeah it was

1353
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:16,798
uh we did that one and then we did

1354
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:20,279
another one for the series on on

1355
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:23,159
Deathmatch wrestling and and it's a kind

1356
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,480
of a separate culture

1357
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:28,159
than even any other pro wrestling and

1358
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,440
it's kind of merged because aw puts

1359
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:35,399
death match wrestling on TV but it was

1360
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,880
so maligned and when you talk to even

1361
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,680
today when I talk to some of the guys

1362
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,880
that are you know WWE wrestlers yeah

1363
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,598
they'll be like oh I hate that [ __ ] it's

1364
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,480
kind of it's got like tattoos and

1365
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,960
scratchers you know like people

1366
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,079
professional yeah yeah yeah or or like

1367
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,079
um or like I I I was telling my friend

1368
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,559
I'm like yeah you got to look at what

1369
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,839
you're doing you're like Iron Maiden and

1370
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,880
they're what they're doing is is psycho

1371
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:04,119
sin or yeah or like Napal death maybe

1372
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,760
even where it's it's not the same it's

1373
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:09,720
but it's it's valid and there's people

1374
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:13,000
that that like it and yeah it is

1375
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:17,719
definitely extreme and it's it's weird

1376
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:20,920
to watch because you know this person is

1377
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:22,879
going to suffer for this afterwards like

1378
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,480
permanently permanently like every

1379
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,798
single person yeah every single person

1380
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,639
needs medical attention after wrestling

1381
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:33,960
and the the compensation for the level

1382
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:35,199
of suffering is completely out of whack

1383
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,760
yeah I makes no

1384
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:40,239
sense

1385
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,000
just yeah that was uh it was fascinating

1386
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,959
for me I'm still fascinated by what

1387
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,239
motivates that like I've got a lot of

1388
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,358
friends that that are those kinds of

1389
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:52,479
wrestlers or do that kind of wrestling

1390
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:55,759
and uh yeah it it is such a uh a weird

1391
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,480
subsect of a already strange culture

1392
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,319
yeah how much do you think that came in

1393
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,358
to inspire what you didn't [ __ ] up oh

1394
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,639
the blading and stuff yeah because we we

1395
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,920
when we first started playing

1396
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:09,960
shows I would like hit myself with a

1397
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,079
microphone and try and bust myself open

1398
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,000
the hard way like Wesley Willis does

1399
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,920
yeah did and sound guys [ __ ] hated

1400
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,838
you I bet hated me yeah I bled very

1401
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:25,039
little had massive bruising and severe

1402
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,880
headaches afterwards and I was working

1403
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,240
in a video store at the time and there

1404
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,880
was this guy Glenn stelter legendary

1405
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:35,959
Toronto Zen maker and play guitar and a

1406
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,318
bunch of cool bands too and he had this

1407
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,119
crazy VHS tape collection about

1408
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,759
everything but a lot of wrestling stuff

1409
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,039
and I'm like how do they bleed like that

1410
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,960
like what are they

1411
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:50,000
doing to get that he's like ah they uh

1412
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,280
they take aspirin and and uh cut

1413
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,760
themselves with the razor blade I'm like

1414
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,880
what like yeah yeah yeah and he's like

1415
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,640
this pretty

1416
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,318
now it's all so so quaint like you just

1417
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:02,400
type in how do they bleed on the

1418
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,639
wrestling but at that point it was like

1419
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,838
what he's like yeah yeah they take a

1420
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:10,719
little blade he's like pointing one see

1421
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:13,199
they right there and I'm like oh [ __ ] so

1422
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:15,679
I can't remember the first

1423
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:19,960
time I did

1424
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:22,318
it but it bled like a [ __ ] and

1425
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,480
it bleeds like anytime you see anything

1426
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,880
of me and I'm just covered in blood like

1427
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,240
yeah there's that MTV Canada performance

1428
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,079
where just sheets of blood are coming

1429
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:35,838
off my head that's always the blade the

1430
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:39,079
blade is like only yeah and then I think

1431
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:42,838
I also kind of tried it's weird because

1432
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:46,760
they're almost hardcore specifically is

1433
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:48,440
almost antithetical to like wrestling

1434
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,119
because wrestling is the presentation of

1435
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,200
a character and sort of the manipulation

1436
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,280
of reality manipulation of reality

1437
00:57:53,199 --> 00:58:00,038
whereas I think hardcore is about trying

1438
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,000
to obviously manipulate reality and and

1439
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:04,599
you're you're definitely not presenting

1440
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,760
fact but you're trying to be as real as

1441
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:08,119
possible and as authentically yourself

1442
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,319
as possible and you're singing about

1443
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,000
your own life and you're trying to

1444
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,920
present yourself as a real person on

1445
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,880
stage L you be the Misfits or yeah yeah

1446
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,760
or something like that right like and

1447
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,680
that's that's kind of like what you're

1448
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,440
trying to do so I think during the songs

1449
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:25,598
wrestling definitely influences it but

1450
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,679
in between it's like almost the

1451
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,400
resistance

1452
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:33,038
to be a guy up there cutting promos yeah

1453
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,480
like okay yeah I don't want to be doing

1454
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,559
