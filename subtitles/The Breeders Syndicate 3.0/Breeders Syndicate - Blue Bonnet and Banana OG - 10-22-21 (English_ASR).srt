and sound super smart

95
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,878
and of course i'm just regurgitating it

96
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,640
because i'm not smart at all so

97
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,039
sound is a mess is the sound a mess for

98
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,039
everyone

99
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,639
is the sound a mess

100
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,560
perhaps a blooper scope for me i was

101
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,439
wondering how many before i hit the

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
skunky pino that's not how it really

103
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,680
works

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,439
uh

105
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,640
in any kind of

106
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,759
genetic

107
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,279
equation

108
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,399
um it could be the first one it could be

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,199
left

110
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,120

127
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,839

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,199

131
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,279
internet thing on it so youtube is just

132
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,639
[ __ ] for tonight that's it for youtube

133
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,839
oh well we tried with youtube

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,519
people can come back over here if they

135
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,439
want

136
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,879
all right

137
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,839
yeah youtube youtube epically failed

138
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,360
um

139
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,719
yeah sometimes the internet connection

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
really [ __ ] sucks and it's been

141
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
really bad on my computer so i guess i

142
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,359
just [ __ ] for youtube

143
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,879
um

144
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
what else we got is it doing okay on

145
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
here so far or is it choppy

146
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,560
i know last time the sound cut out and

147
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,560
that was even worse

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,399
yeah it's always some [ __ ] i tried

149
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
to do it beforehand but youtube doesn't

150
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,638
really let you not go live and just

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
test it out

152
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,038
anyway so we're going to be talking

153
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,280
about

154
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,079
breeders that you should like right

155
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,038
people that you should go support

156
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,038
um

157
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,120
and this this is more more important

158
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,478
than ever it's not on it's not on

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
youtube anymore

160
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,680
so anybody that asks about youtube can

161
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
you guys

162
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,519
keep them on it and help me out with

163
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,560
that so that i don't have to keep going

164
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,719
saying it's not on youtube anymore

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,478
yeah

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
hopefully people will jump on over here

167
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,680
from youtube

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,439
sucks youtube's such a better platform

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
but this computer has been

170
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,519
not running so smooth with its uh

171
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,560
internet connection

172
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,519
anyway

173
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,199
so

174
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,560
it's more important than ever now to

175
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,319
support

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
the people that matter

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,960
because you have to use your money like

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
swords yeah dude these these shirts are

179
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,879

180
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,199
favorites um you have to use your money

181
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,639
like swords that's it

182
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,439
there's a lot of bad folk in this

183
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,199
industry and right now that pie has

184
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,439
gotten very very very teensy

185
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
because of corporate [ __ ]

186
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,360
and corporate box really it is people

187
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
want cheaper weed that aren't growers

188
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:35,800
gypsy i'm gonna slap you

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
[ __ ] um

190
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
yeah so

191
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,159
vote with your dollars exactly

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,399
the problem is the problem is prop 64

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
passed we all knew we all knew that was

194
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,239
gonna happen

195
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
and uh it was only a matter of time till

196
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
the market crashed and it crashed it

197
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,918
crashed hard not just for for seeds but

198
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,519
for wheat in general and i think now

199
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,560
that the unemployment has stopped

200
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,879
running in in um california and

201
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
nationwide as far as like the extra

202
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,759
payments that people are getting during

203
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,759
kovid

204
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,479
no one's spending any money

205
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,319
so

206
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,719
if you do not want to see your favorite

207
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
mom and pop shops sink you have to

208
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
support these guys all of them i mean

209
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,479

212
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,638
they're they're still the the people

213
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,000
that help build this industry

214
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,519
don't worry about that [ __ ] in my head

215

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,240
us about the pbo gmail what did it pass

353
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,838
on reliably in the crosses how did you

354
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
what what did you like about how does it

355
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,320
compare to the blue bonnet mill so

356
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,078
when picking that male what i wanted to

357
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,399
do with with most banana ogs which

358
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,359
you're going to find is

359
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,679
it out crosses a lot of amazing banana

360
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
type stuff nog stuff

361
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,439
but it then shits out a lot of boof like

362
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,039
a lot of skunk one type stuff um

363
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
blando

364
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,838
type stuff that probably came from the

365
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,839
sega math s6040

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,720
so i wanted to improve that

367
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,518
aspect of the breeding with it and keep

368
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,920
it more to higher resin production

369
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,959
and um keeping the banana tones more um

370
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,199
dominant

371
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,879
because you know yeah yes youtube is

372
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
down yes

373
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,120
um

374
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,919
where am i at sorry it's hard to read

375
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
and answer questions and do all this

376
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,639
right now

377
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,719
but yeah so so that was the difference

378
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,159
in in just the platinum bananog versus

379
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,000
banana og youtube is down

380
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,319
youtube is down

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
um

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
as far as the bonnet i mean it's it's

383
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,800
two different uh

384
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
it's two different

385
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,439
whole different projects

386
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,159
like

387
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,079
i don't just choose a male based on one

388
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:30,879
set of characteristics jaws is a [ __ ]

389
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,879
don't you know what

390

395

you know how that works because people

396
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,240
think if i don't say anything

397
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
that i'm [ __ ] vouching for it because

398
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,240
people are stupid so don't start putting

403
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,679
set of structure or one look for a mill

404
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,759
i

405
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,519
i choose a male based on what i want to

406
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,958
create and then i also choose its

407
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
partners based on what i want to

408
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,198
accomplish as well that's how it should

409
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,479
always be it should always be that way

410
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,639
with anyone making anything right so

411
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
the reason i did the banana was because

412
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,959
i wanted to

413
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
i love i i loved banana og growing up

414
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,638
and i've made a lot of cool [ __ ] with

415
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,039
this especially the platinum banana og

416
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,399
uh my boy hugo [ __ ] yourself that was

417
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,078
the name that he really used uh he

418
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,480
handed me off that cut and it was called

419
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,559
platinum banana when i got it

420
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
uh it wasn't my name for it

421
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,319
but um

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,559
yeah i always had a love affair with it

423
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,240
um organ kid was always super cool to me

424
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,958
too so i thought it would be a cool

425
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,198
project to just banana up everything and

426
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,879
see where it went um

427
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,359
i didn't have all the plants in the room

428
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,639
during the last platinum banana ogbx one

429
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
mil thing

430
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,680
and we actually ended up doing a

431
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,198
platinum banana og bx2 to the male so we

432
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,559
kept back crossing to the male as

433
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,479
opposed to back crossing to the female

434
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,879
which isn't done very often but that was

435
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,560
to see how we bred and he bred very

436
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,639
consistent um

437
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,239
there was a certain look that he had

438
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
i'm trying to think of where you can see

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,440
that look i know denali put up pictures

440
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
of

441
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,480
the

442
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,480
platinum alien orange cookies somewhere

443
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,639
and that has the distinct look almost

444
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
all those came out looking like what the

445
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
mail passes on

446
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,078
now with uh

447
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,958
the blue bonnet

448
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:34,559
my main intention was to find a male

449
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,239
that would bring the blueberry terps

450
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,479
not decrease resin production and not

451
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
decrease potency and as you guys as some

452
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,000
of you know that have worked a blueberry

453
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,599
a lot or grown a lot of blueberry um

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,078
that's not something you see very much

455
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
of you know like blueberry doesn't tend

456
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,638
to add potency blueberry itself isn't a

457
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
super resinous plant when you compare it

458
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,720
to modern day lines

459
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,959
so it was very fortunate that

460
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,040
the first male that i ended up using

461
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,439
from the blue bonnet did all of that and

462
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,599
then some um

463
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,079
his structure you can kind of see has

464
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,278
has a little bit of um

465
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,679
he can pass on a little bit of

466
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,039
foxtailing if if there's too much light

467
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,278
or too much heat

468
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,599
but most of it is like a nipple type bud

469
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,360
top and tons of resin production it's

470
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,079
it's mostly afghani as opposed to what

471
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,159
most people think of as blueberry sativa

472
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,919
stuff blueberry sativa stuff hey what's

473
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,480
up jax how you doing

474
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,759
um with the blueberry sativa stuff

475
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,759
uh so

476
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,600
i actually thought most of this time

477
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,320
that what i was looking for was gonna be

478
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,800
in the blueberry sativa stuff uh

479
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,720
blue moonshine blue velvet

480
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,319
moonshine rocket fuel all the other ones

481
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
that we were popping at the time but

482
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,440
what i ended up finding was pretty

483
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,799
amazing stuff in the afghani end so

484
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
yeah and that was that was because the

485
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,879

a male i popped the 10 pack that i got

501
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,679
didn't think i'd find anything in that

502
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,359
but during the blueberry hunt we popped

503
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,200
several hundred seeds

504
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,319

we had just gotten done with the rose

507
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,759
flow selections right before that

508
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,879
um

509
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,119
god

510
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
different lots of different blueberry

511
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,558
like from different people different f

512
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:49,759
gens and all that so yeah it's it's wild

513
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,960
it was a wild lucky lucky lucky pick and

514
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,319
the only reason i picked that male as

515
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,400
opposed to the others was because he

516
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,798
kept raising his hands up like even in

517
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,320
veg as he was growing up it you know

518
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,160
plants pray when they're happy this one

519
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,558
just was his families would be like this

520
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
almost 90 degrees just parallel to the

521
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,918
stem and i'd be like is that

522
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
[ __ ] raising his hands i bet

523
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,520
he's raising his hands for me and that's

524
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,038
uh that's really what i went with

525
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,679
something as easy as that because in the

526
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,400
end when you pick a male

527
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,400
unless you're unless you're

528
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,880
used to a line and really really

529
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
experience with that specific line it's

530
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,840
all a shotgun method

531
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,000
you're never going to know how a male

532
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,399
truly breeds until you rent off spring

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,240
so you have to start somewhere

534
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
my somewhere was

535
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
there

536
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,519
and you can see it in offspring

537
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,280
sometimes which is really cool um the

538
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,639
purple stripe stock so i thought he

539
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,319
would actually pass a lot more purple

540
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
traits than he does he can pass some

541
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,480
purple traits but it's not like a main

542
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,599
trait which is usually from the orbiting

543
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
purple tie end of blueberry

544
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,480
uh

545
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
usually bx does differ from land to line

546
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,319
it it just depends

547
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,480
um at what generation did you bx what

548
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,480
are you talking about for which

549
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,798
usually i only bx if i have a certain

550
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,558
line that i really like and i want to

551
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,798
use a male from that line and i don't

552
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,279
want to just reverse then i'll be x

553
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:12,879
but it's not my it's not a

554
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,879
i've done it a lot but it's not

555
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,000
it's not necessary all the time

556
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,759
unless you're trying to get work a clone

557
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,919
only line into mail form

558
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,038
like a perfect example would be bubba

559
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,520
above a bx to use as a male would be a

560
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:31,038
great breeding line or um

561
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,038
something else that's not available

562
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,720
in

563
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,879
seed form you know something like that i

564
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,880
don't know

565
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,160
put that mail and have to see some resin

566
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
pop out yeah um

567
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,200
resin popping out of males is one of

568
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,798
those things that's that's real

569
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,558
debatable on whether it's showing

570
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,558
intersex traits by having a lot of resin

571
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,798
or not um

572
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,319
still on the fence bring back face melt

573
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,119
and clockwork orange you know we did

574
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,200
face melt and that was really popular um

575
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,439
some jackass stole the name and stuck it

576
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
on his lines and marketed in high time

577
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
so i just never

578
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,240
never thought to redo it are you

579
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,960
familiar with heirloom varieties

580
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
from southern appalachia appalachia no

581
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,919
i'm not i'm not from that area and

582
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
unless you're from that area it's kind

583
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,559
of hard to break into it but that would

584
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,558
be cool to know more about

585
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,120
i did a lot of clockwork orange work um

586
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,079
we kept that line going

587
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,678
and and tried to keep it mostly in stock

588
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,359
but it was a little hard it's hard to

589
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,480
reverse

590
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,319
um

591
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,480
but i i ended up passing it on and i

592
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,000
think crybaby works with it now

593
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
so

594
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,839
there's only so much i can do with it

595
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
um it's kind of like an art piece like

596
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,158
if you if you have a certain character

597
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,399
you draw

598
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
and you you get stuck in that character

599
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
and it's hard to see outside that

600
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,440
character sometimes it's best to pass it

601
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
on to someone else to make something new

602
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
um

603
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,240
mention that you like cherry pie what do

604
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,240
you like about it when you did you get

605
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,960
actual cherry terps no

606
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,519
how did the high hit you um

607
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,960
cherry pie i got a lot of gas out of but

608
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,720
i liked how it hit me it gave me in a

609
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,440
similar anti-anxiety high that i got

610
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,519
from something like a blueberry but with

611
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,120
a little more potency a lot of people

612
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,879
have complaints about cherry pie because

613
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,719
of the intersex traits i didn't have a

614
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
lot of problems with that

615
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,400
um

616
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,759
but i don't like flood nitrogen and

617
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,038
flower which i think is one of the main

618
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,679
problems with that

619
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,640
um top three favorite blue bonnet

620
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,080
crosses oh that's a hard one

621
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,759
one's going to be punchy blooster just

622
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,279
because the turfs were so next level

623
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,558
like a like

624
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,240
like a slurpee syrup types

625
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,918
if you were if you were vaping it you

626
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
would actually taste blueberries with

627
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,720
sugar and

628
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,038
and all that in it it's it's very

629
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,880
exceptional in that way um

630
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,798
bubble berry was also an amazing breeder

631
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,679
and amazingly uniform um for being a a

632
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,440
simple

633
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,159
one-step hybrid i don't want to call an

634
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,159
f1 because it was not a it was you know

635
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,360
not a true f1 but um a one-step hybrid

636
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,640
it offered a lot of uniformity being

637
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,639
that they were both

638
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,080
somewhat afghani bases

639
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,080
um

640
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:14,558
a third god damn

641
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,480
the blooper skunk is still up there um

642
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,639
because it's a great super skunk regular

643
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,079
line um not necessarily because it was

644
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
great for letting the blue terps pass

645
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,879
through but because i love super skunk

646
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,079
so much it seemed to be one of my

647
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,559
favorites

648
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,599
yeah the resino g blue bonnet the the

649
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,359
kush cross to the blue bonnet is is

650
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,558
gnarly potent and it let some of the

651
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,798
berry come through which a lot of the

652
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,480
og's didn't necessarily the louis blue

653
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,359
bonnet also let those come through

654
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
what's up big red

655
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,319
well i thought bryn would be here to say

656
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,839
hi but she just walked out

657
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,678
run the bubble bonnet again really want

658
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,399
to dive into cherry aka i love that

659
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,360
cherry ak cut um i know csi's using it

660
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,200
in some of his stuff too

661
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,918
that water pipe's gonna be so loud it

662
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,000
always is um

663
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,679
yeah i can't wait to see what we do what

664
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,679
else we do with the cherry ak stuff

665
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,440
we miss you too red

666
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,440

no it's okay uh can you guys hear that i

668
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,360
think it's okay

669
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,759
are you getting more head band phenos in

670
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,399
that matchup

671
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,000
which one the banana headband yeah it's

672
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
it's it's sticking mainly to og and

673
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,839
headband styles like with the um

674
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,839

675
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,960

676
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,038
the cherry a cake i think is what you're

677
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,159
asking i don't know man that cherry ak

678
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,839
cut i first found in san diego and i had

679
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,760
seen other cherry ak cuts that weren't

680
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,399
super resinous but were super purple i

681
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,319
know there was a cherry liqueur cut that

682
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
naboo used so he hates anybody calling

683
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,038
anything cherry aka even though his was

684
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,798
the cherry liqueur cut um i never never

685
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,879
got to run his but it did make some

686
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,200
amazing stuff in black russian

687
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
um

688
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,359
but yeah first time i saw it was in san

689
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,159
diego never saw it after i left san

690
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,558
diego and then it happened to come

691
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
across in a

692
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,678
two year long trade that it took for

693
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,399
this person to follow through and most

694
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,000
of what he sent me was incorrect but

695
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,038
the one thing he did send correct was

696
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
that

697
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,839
cherry aka cut and he had a friend in

698
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
san diego so he probably got in san

699
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,798
diego as well what's up with the rainbow

700
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,720
i did never use it because he was still

701
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,720
uh a small boat was still doing stuff

702
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,880
with it so i didn't

703
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,960
jump on it but yeah

704
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,080
and now i mean it's it's very much like

705
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,159
a really nice og kbb type so i've done a

706
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,519
lot of those so you know it was his

707
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,520
project and hopefully he'll bring it

708
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,119
back how many males would you test

709
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,639
before picking one for a project like

710
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,879
bluebonnet

711
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,520
what do you mean by test

712
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,440
we ran him out to see how he flowered

713
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,720
out for his general structure before we

714
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,720
used him

715
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,038
um

716
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,798
but as far as hitting a line first you

717
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,480
hit everything with it you see if it

718
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,278
works you run the progeny and if it all

719
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,919
sucks on the next on to the next you

720
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,919
know that's how it always works um

721
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,480
usually if if i don't find something i

722
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,240
like in the first two males then i'm not

723
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
gonna i'm not gonna keep pursuing it

724
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
because it's a lot of lost money in that

725
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
case

726
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,200
yeah that's with a project like

727
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,640
bluebonnet literally that was all luck

728
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,240
um and all work from lone star it had

729
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,320
very little to do with me or anything i

730
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,519
did special i can't take much credit for

731
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:36,720
it that was already a worked blue line

732
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,720
from someone and rest in peace lone star

733
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,038
um you can still find some of lone star

734
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,640
stuff as well from aka texas kid i do

735
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,079
believe he has some

736
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,159
um

737
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,480
i don't know who else is putting out

738
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
yeah

739
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,759
[Music]

740
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,759
that was coo

741
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,119
that was a cool line

742
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,640
lone star was putting it out at the same

743
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,399
time i was putting out my riot berry so

744
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,400
i didn't give it a chance back then

745
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,400
because i was a [ __ ] and i kind of

746
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
thought like i had the best [ __ ] ever

747
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,839
the best blueberry ever so i don't need

748
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
to see anybody else's blueberries but

749
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,359
you know i could have uh done some magic

750
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,558
[ __ ] just crossing right very to it back

751
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,759
then if they were both around at the

752
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,678
same time

753
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,679
no i haven't pharo i haven't at all

754

759
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,918
tofino hunt

760
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,199
look through for large numbers of seeds

761
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,960
you know usually if i'm looking through

762
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,798
large numbers of seeds i don't go over

763
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,519
half gallon and i pop it

764
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,240

what's your most flavorful available

768
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:57,199
with a powerful effect now

769
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
powerful is subjective because there are

770
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,480
certain things

771
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,960
that like um

772
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,120
urkel for example will hit me super hard

773
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,159
because my brain chemistry whereas other

774
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,158
people like think it's one of the

775
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,960
weakest strains on earth you know um

776
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,720
that's subjective

777
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
let's see

778
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,200
flavorful

779
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,640
right now uh even the blue resin super

780
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,640
flavorful um

781
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,759
some of the um banana og stuff like the

782
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,919
sour apple platinum banana og is really

783
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,359
flavorful too i know that that's still i

784
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
think available

785
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,839
um

786
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,200
banana thai was super flavorful

787
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
um

788
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,240
there's so much that i did in the blue

789
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,200
bonnet stuff that i'd love to list like

790
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,759
the the bubble berry v2

791
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,440
was super flavorful almost anything with

792
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,240
the blue bonnet mail was super flavorful

793
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,399
so if you have a specific like you want

794
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,278
something gassy with berry the way you

795
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,519
do it

796
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,720
brindies it was very flavorful skittles

797
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,639
is good [ __ ]

798
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
for flavor

799
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
um

800
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
cherry berry cherry berry's super

801
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
flavorful and i think that's from some

802
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,319
of the trapinoline in it that

803
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
trapinoline makes everything more

804
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,639
flavorful if you cross it out outcross

805
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,480
it did you cross the bonnet with any of

806
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,159
your strawberry stuff i did not but

807
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,599
hopefully in the near future we can do

808
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,559
some of that i'm pretty excited about

809
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,119
that

810
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,720
you're going to be re-releasing any

811
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,119
bonnet stuff

812
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
i haven't needed to re-release much

813
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,639
because i have all of it

814
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
and i mean there's some stuff that sold

815

try chrome

839
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,439
um

840
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,960
when

841
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,840
well

842
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,759
they still need to be

843
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,639
cloned and flipped so it's no we don't

844
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,398
really rush it you know um not in a rush

845
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,000
to get anything to market like that even

846
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,918
though probably with the seed market now

847
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,278
we should be rushing to do everything

848
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,278
but that's not how you make good [ __ ]

849
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
also

850
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
and this is for real

851
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,918
like everybody in the in our in our

852
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,320
industry people making seeds what not

853
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,240
pay really close attention to to your

854
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,639
mental health during this time and

855
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,480
that's coming from someone who has all

856
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,919
you know i'm a [ __ ]

857
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,120
[ __ ] show when it comes to mental stuff

858
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,840
but

859
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,879
everyone needs to be taking care of each

860
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,119
other um

861
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,360
it's gonna be tough times coming up

862
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,839
for all of us in the cannabis industry

863
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,199
and and and all you with passion take

864
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,278
care of each other

865
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,319
it's it's gonna be very [ __ ] scary

866
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,079
and hard

867
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,079
um we've all kind of waited for that

868
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,359
ball to drop from

869
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,879

corporate [ __ ]

871
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840

872
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,679
dedication

873
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,439

883
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,599

921
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,879

released in the robot form but as you

924
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,959

925
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,239
on it anymore

926
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,399

927
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,720

928
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,719
shits and gigs but the robot the robot

929

931
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,839
supposed to auto tune and all this [ __ ]

932
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,558
but it really didn't do a great job of

933
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,798
it

934
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,158

1290
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,119
um i know some of the other san diego

1291
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,759
dudes think that that's a definite

1292
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,240
possibility and

1293
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,319

1294

1367
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,239
don't trust people especially in this

1368
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,800
industry people suck

1369
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,719
the lineage on blooper skunk is uh

1370
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:51,119
diesel crossed a blue bonnet and diesel

1371
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,799
is the mass super s1 now super v2 tech

1372
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,519
for being super technical

1373
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,519
but it was the the only only mass super

1374
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,039
that people saw outside of the va super

1375
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,440
which was a different cut

1376
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,199
obviously a different cut

1377
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,679
ooh just found some strawberry roadkill

1378
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:08,399

the mendo s ones that's where you're

1562
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,519
gonna find that's where you if you run

1563
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,000
enough of those you will find the skunky

1564
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,679
ones um they're gonna be some of the

1565
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,119
ugliest because that tends to happen

1566
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,960
even with the diesel and the super

1567
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,960
skunks and stuff like that the more

1568
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,679
skunky they are usually the uglier they

1569
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,400
are

1570
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:33,039
um and the more prone to herm they are

1571
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,000
but if you want those terps or thiols i

1572
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:38,000
should say that's how you got to go

1573
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,599
if you want those cannabinoids i think

1574
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,838

00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:43,439
knobby and leafy with dog tongues

1604
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,280
because that's what scooper super skunk

1605
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,280
looks like

1606
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,839
brento's freshmaker just came in i was

1607
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,839

do you have success using s-ones as

1612
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:07,119
mothers absolutely absolutely

1613
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,960
is herming and potency relation just

1614
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,838
expressions of hyper vigor or more

1615
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,000
likely to will to live uh hermaphroditic

1616
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:17,279
expressions could be all kinds of things

1617
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,280
555 for local botanists

1618
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,559
the hermaphroditic expression could be

1619
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,000
all kinds of things depends on the line

1620
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,519
as far as the super skunk goes it just

1621
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,358
seems to be a what we call link trait um

1622
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,838
link trait to the files for whatever

1623
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:32,078
that thiallic stuff it tends to be quick

1624
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:33,119
to herm indoors it seems to do well

1625
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,480
outdoor

1626
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,559
but not a lot of people want to be

1627
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,960
growing skunky stuff outdoor for many

1628
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,960
reasons

1629
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,159
onycd and urkel would be a good

1630
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,118
combination to bring some of that stuff

1631
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,039
out

1632
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,119
i found that like diesel and sours

1633
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:50,159
combined can also complement each other

1634
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,160
really well to bring that out

1635

01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,358
testing in-house with the blue bonnet

1816
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:03,199
stuff i did in-house and out of the

1817
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:04,719
house so a lot of other people were

1818
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:07,759
testing it along

1819
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,759
along the same time um

1820
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,359
but usually most of the years it's been

1821
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,119
me testing it myself because there's

1822
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,759
nothing more

1823
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,200
uh important than a breeder knowing what

1824
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,240
he's got in front of him because you

1825
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,480
really don't know what kind of melt you

1826
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,959
have unless you're doing it yourself

1827
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,318
uh you too tent flow freeland is still

1828
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,280
around so

1829
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,960
yes and no i know that for a while bc

1830
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,200
blood depot ripped off the strain and

1831
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,119
called it the big for a while but they

1832
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,439
never sell the same thing twice as the

1833
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,760
same strain so who knows

1834
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,000
um butterscotch hawaiian still around

1835
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,920
and um

1836
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,239
and g13 hash plants still around so i i

1837
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,200
would imagine that it could be remade

1838
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:48,479
not the same obviously as uh swampy

1839
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:49,919
intended

1840
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,599
but it could be

1841
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,119
made to be something similar at least

1842
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,838
the butterscotch hawaiian seems to be

1843
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,760
very consistent for reading

1844
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,838
butterscotchy terps

1845
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,599
yeah when making seeds is a good idea to

1846
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:04,078
start a male into flower a week or two

1847
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,440
before the donor plants flower

1848
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,359
when i'm doing regular seeds i'll fly

1849
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,760
them at the same time if i'm reversing

1850
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:12,159
seeds that's a big difference if i'm

1851
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,480
reversing i'll usually stagger some at

1852
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,639
uh one week before

1853
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,719
trigger for the rest some i'll do two

1854
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,520
weeks a trigger for the rest so i'll do

1855
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,679
three

1856
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,560
uh in the case of hemp i learned at

1857
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,158
least with the hemp lines i was working

1858
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,798
you trigger them at the same time it

1859
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,798
just instantly reverses so well

1860
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:33,600
and so fast that you don't have to

1861
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:35,039
stagger the trigger

1862
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,400
he had a couple miles i recall correctly

1863
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,119
one was a little too dominant the ones

1864
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,879
he had very the first was deadly g there

1865
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,278
you go there you go

1866
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,600
never mind your wife is snoring

1867
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,359
do you stress test before breeding um i

1868
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,960
don't do a lot of stress testing because

1869
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,239
i think that people should grow weed

1870
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,079
right

1871
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,678
you know but if something is showing any

1872
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,679
kind of hermaphroditic traits in a

1873
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,520
normally good grown room then there's a

1874
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,920
[ __ ] problem you know you just don't

1875
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,920
use it

1876
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,959
orange crush oh the orange dreams are so

1877
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,039
old hopefully you kept them in a fridge

1878
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,719
that's a really old line how old was the

1879
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:13,000
orange crust i think he said oh my god

1880
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:16,000
that whole line was um 2007

1881
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
2006 right in there so it's a really old

1882
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,319
line it's a lean forward i want to see

1883
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,319
something

1884
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,158
get a red toupee

1885
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,839
notice your femmes being better resin

1886
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,198
producers but generally lower yields i

1887
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,679
don't i don't notice anything consistent

1888
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:43,919
like that um

1889
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,440
yeah it's just [ __ ] in [ __ ] out i always

1890
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:51,199
say that like it whether it's with uh

1891
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:52,559
red seeds femme seeds hash

1892
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,479
the more better quality parents have

1893
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,679
better quality results and and

1894
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:59,439
feminization doesn't make things be any

1895
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,880
more hermaphroditic it doesn't make any

1896
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:02,879
things be more

1897
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,640
stretchy or anything like that it just

1898
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,760
it's it just everything is very

1899
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,039
dependent on what you choose

1900
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,440
specifically

1901
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,760
skittles is apparently what grape

1902
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:14,319
grapefruit no people say it's a green

1903
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:17,840
sherb s1 um

1904
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:19,679
joe what was it jodrey sherb s1 i think

1905
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,440
maybe i think that's what the the

1906
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,679
consensus is what would you recommend

1907
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,279
for your cancer treatment symptoms

1908
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,239
something that is more on the indica

1909
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,439
side that will help you with your

1910
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:28,639
appetite so

1911
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:30,399
um

1912
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,880
what people normally consider

1913
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:35,039
sativas help my appetite but if if you

1914
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,640
think that uh afghanistan everybody has

1915
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:39,439
a different brain chemistry if afghanis

1916
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,880
are what help your um

1917
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:44,000
you know whatever is going on with your

1918
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,840
nausea and your in your appetite um

1919
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,920
stuff like my pacific northwest hash

1920
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,480
plant bluebonnet does great the white

1921
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,480
blue bonnet

1922
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,000
the silver pearl blue bonnet would

1923
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,000
probably do the nausea thing too i know

1924
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,079
silver pearl helped brain a lot and

1925
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,079
that's a that is a hearty strong indica

1926
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,600
uh do you remember throw growing the

1927
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:09,600
orange crush was that across a

1928
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,360
california orange yes it was a it was an

1929
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,360
old cut of cali orange across the

1930
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:15,920
blueberry and it was phenomenal it's my

1931
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:16,880
favorite orange strain ever

1932
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,319
yeah it would have probably been the

1933
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,679
same one that you would have seen alt

1934
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,920
ago there was there was a main orange

1935
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,158
crush going around a cut

1936
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,158
ncga used it a bit

1937
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,920
i know jojo used it a bit we had it down

1938
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,759
to san diego and james hogg used it a

1939
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,640
bit um

1940
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,159
yeah

1941
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,159
[ __ ] was phenomenal

1942
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,238
if you're breeding for a thc cbd variety

1943
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:41,559
or thcg variety would you use a hint

1944
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,559
male or female

1945
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,920
okay let me think in my head if i of a

1946
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,920
specific project

1947
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,000
i if i was breeding for

1948
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:58,079
more cbd than thc i would probably

1949
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,039
first start with the female as the hemp

1950
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:02,960
and and uh a strong thc

1951
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,158
uh plant is the male

1952
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,920
and

1953
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:08,719
see how that went but it's not there's

1954
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:12,158
no certain specific surefire way to do

1955
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,520
that it genetics depend on it's so plant

1956
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,359
specific

1957
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,120
there's no surefire way but that's how i

1958
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,359
would start it

1959
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:21,439
dreamsicle i believe that was the name

1960
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,359
for um orange creamsicle was the orange

1961
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:24,799
dream sandstorm that we made back in the

1962
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,799
day when we crossed that orange

1963
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,760
dreamline to sandstorm it was called

1964
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,760
orange dreamsicle

1965
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,880
yeah i'm a total nerd on names when it

1966
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,960
comes to to names i you know and in the

1967
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,560
history of lines and provenance and

1968
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,560
getting sourcing stuff from actual

1969
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,679
breeders and then checking to see if

1970
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,960
that breeder even knows what the [ __ ]

1971
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,480
they're talking about checking to see if

1972
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,119
they understood pollen contamination or

1973
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:49,119
pollen control i mean and that affects

1974
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,399
all of us that affects

1975
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,719
all of us

1976
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:55,198
i don't care who you are

1977
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,158

01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:11,839
what do we got what can you tell me

2035
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,840
about bubble gum that secret matha used

2036
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,600
and serious eats bubble gum is different

2037
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,440
i see the indians

2038
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,600
indiana being more indica but sirius

2039
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,599
says their bubblegum is more sativa so i

2040
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,719
believe adam dunn tried to go over that

2041
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,239
whole thing we were going to do a

2042
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,359
bubblegum show with all the bubblegum

2043
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:26,639
guys but

2044
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,639
um

2045
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,000
my friend never got back to me on it

2046
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,840
that was going to set it up so i don't

2047
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,520
know if we'll ever get to it

2048
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,640
the indiana bubblegum cut that's over

2049
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,560
here is from sirius seeds

2050
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,400
it was a selection from the year that

2051
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,480
serious seeds won the cup

2052
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:44,158
with that said there was

2053
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,158
i know a lot of people had a lot of

2054
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:48,238
there was a lot of phenos in it

2055
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:49,599
and people didn't always find some

2056
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:51,839
amazing stuff in it that was super

2057
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,679
bubble gummy but that cut is phenomenal

2058
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,760
for bubble gum however it's not super

2059
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,039
bubblegum tasting and i think that

2060
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,440
personally i think you need to add in

2061
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:03,039
some terpenoline so if if any of you

2062

it's it's our penalty bubble gum and it

2095

2110
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,719
citrusy terps and hash

2111
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,158
oh i did a lot of orange stuff over the

2112
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,439
years i haven't really been [ __ ] with

2113
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:49,519
orange lately

2114
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:51,279
um

2115
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,880
any of the orange oh there was there

2116
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:54,479
wasn't orange in the blue bonnet stuff

2117
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,960
that did have citrusy chirps but also

2118
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,079
had og type chirps

2119
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,158
so it really took in a different

2120
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:02,079
direction i'm not a big fan of

2121
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:04,158
tangy stuff

2122
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:05,840

2123
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:07,198
i'm not a big fan of tangy stuff for any

01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,400
orange chips because to me it also

2125
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:09,839

2126
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:11,439
like

2127
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,640

gone for a long time

2169
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:36,399
i used to get so mad when people would

2170
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:39,678
call it agent orange because i

2171
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:41,679
[ __ ] couldn't [ __ ] stand that [ __ ]

2172
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,760
man i couldn't stand sub so i was like

2173

oh not agent orange don't call it that

2174
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,000
it's not even an orange smelling strain

2175
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,840
it was back when we used to call it uh

2176
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,359
call strains by like their hair color

2177
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,679
and [ __ ] you know like it was an orange

2178
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,559
haired strain um

2179
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,000

2181
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,079
strain and it was very golden when it

2182
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,520
cured so it just really made sense it

2183
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:02,719
was super potent people were like

2184
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,440
talking about how their legs would go

2185
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,560
numb when they smoked it um so i thought

2186
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:11,439

these because um this dude uh ran

01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:21,360
through all i think four finos that he

2334
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,479
ended up picking from um female

2335
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,880
there were some really beautiful

2336
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:26,559
pictures of it the blue wreckers and and

2337
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,319
he found

2338
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,960
most of the ones that were

2339
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:32,319
uh it had a pretty good grading scale of

2340
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,039
of um

2341
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:36,960
purely original diesel dominant to

2342
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:39,600
very blue bonnet dominant so it was

2343
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,600
really cool to see those um here's one

2344
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:45,520
of them let me see

2345
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,520
choose a different asset let's see

2346
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,199
some cool pictures in here i really like

2347
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,920
the way this one looks it reminds me a

2348
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:53,519
lot of old like blueberry hybrids even

2349
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,520
like old-time moonshine hybrids he said

2350
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,280
that it was the led light was very very

2351
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,600
intense so he uh

2352
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:00,800
he was it caused some foxtailing in this

2353
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,639
pheno

2354
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:06,000
that's a beautiful phenom i love i love

2355
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:08,639
stuff like that um i like unique looks

2356
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,359
personally see what else we got

2357
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,359
another one

2358
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:16,719
boom you can't really see the resin

2359
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:18,719
production on it some had great resin

2360
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,399
production like the original diesel the

2361
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,079
girth and thickness and density of the

2362
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,319
original diesel and blue bonnet has a

2363
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:26,719
lot of great density in resin but um

2364
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:28,479
yeah it was it was a mostly original

2365
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,239
diesel is going to dominate most stuff

2366
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:32,959
it is a super skunk

2367
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:35,198
probably with some og type in it or

2368
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,560
maybe even chem 91 which is a super

2369
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:41,359
skunk og type but it tends to dominate

2370
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:43,199
the berry terps but we did get some with

2371
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,439
some berry terps up in here for him so

2372
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,439
yeah

2373
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:51,120
yeah um we do have some blue cheese left

2374
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,920

2375
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,000
like

2376
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,520
if i i that was one that i made the

2377
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,520
second round of the blue bonnet runs

2378
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,840
because people had such a high demand

2379
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,320
for it that i had to do it i know you

2380
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,400

01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,360
without them knowing in bulk and sells

2386
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:16,960
them as his own so god knows i mean it

2387
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:18,880
just depends on when you got it from him

2388
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,000
