00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,919
welcome to breeders syndicate where we

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,359
explore the history of a clandestine

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,800
scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
lived it i'm matthew owner of riot seeds

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,719
i'll occasionally be joined by my

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
co-host not-so-dog breeder and grower

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,960
from mendocino

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,559
welcome to the underground

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
hopefully more people show up so we can

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,198
actually give a nice

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,439
treatise on the past present

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,439
um

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,399
future maybe i don't know if we can talk

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,159
about the future of clone trading clone

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,439
collecting i've talked about it a little

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,639
bit recently

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,599
uh um

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,280
about

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
a little bit of where people are that

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,399
have a lot of these strains archived

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
that are

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,960
rare and old and

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
special

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,840
but um

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,480
i don't think i've really given a full

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,640
long tail of how it kind of how it

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,238
developed over time

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,159
how it was when we were breaking into

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,680
the scene like how one would even go

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
about

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
collecting clones in the first place

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,760
because obviously you know a lot of it's

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
trading

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,118
and not everybody has something to trade

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,879
at the beginning

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,879
uh we'll talk about clone circles

38
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,199
yeah i got to give myself the own crouch

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
here

40
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,438
but until we start that anybody have any

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
questions yet

42
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,118
anything you want me to touch on so i

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,118
don't forget

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,959
anything

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,359
clown hoarding

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,359
i could talk about clown hoarding

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,759
there's plenty of clowns hoarding in the

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,680
seed industry oh my god there it is

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
yeah clown whoring

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
you could do that too

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
clown whoring

52
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,840
those bastards clowns are always whoring

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
around

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,120
clone people

55
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,120
well this is about clone people

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,720
i mean really it's but going to the

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,479
theory of it should

58
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,359
ben sherman fool you know

59
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,359
you know how i roll clay um

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,000
yeah i mean

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
it's all the same theory right like you

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
can you can take a theory and apply it

63
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,318
to

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
folds

65
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,318
it's very easy to do so hopefully you

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
guys can use some critical thinking and

67
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,560
apply it so i don't have to go and go

68
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,318
and go over every single [ __ ] that's

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
pretending to be in circles you know

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,359
it's it's a lot easier just to explain

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
it

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,599
before you know what it is or on a reveg

73
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,518
oh i'm not doing cloning um

74
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,518
tips and tricks but i mean just for that

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
quick one sometimes it's better to take

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,360
it on a re-veg sometimes it's better to

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,879
take it beforehand sometimes things root

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,319
easier after a revenge so yeah

79
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,359
this is george

80
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,359
george from walmart

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
okay

82
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,959
i think at 80 we can be close enough to

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
start this [ __ ] all right so back in

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
the day

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,759
clones weren't really a big thing a lot

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
of a lot of a lot of people were using

87
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,439
seeds when i say back in the day i'm

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,519
talking you know 70s 60s

89
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
on through the 80s up until the 90s

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,680
clones weren't the the primary source

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,680
for people to be passing genetics most

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
of it was done in seed form that's how a

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
lot of this started

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,280
on in through when you get up into

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,639
maybe like the northern lightsair would

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
be a good example

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,479
of

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
how of how people started getting in

99
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,598
these circles that had certain genetics

100
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,798
and were keeping them very tight and

101
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,878
only passing it to people in their

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
circles and trusted people and that all

103
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,479
kind of started because you know there

104
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,318
are different people in each market and

105
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,238
giving someone a special clone that was

106
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,158
considered elite at the time and the

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,000
definition of elite back then is a lot

108
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,759
different than now that is definitely

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,598
morphed but you didn't want to give

110
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,719
someone in the same

111
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,479
area as you the same exact clone

112
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,759
if it was super special

113
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,680
because they'd be knocking into your

114
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,159
market and and you guys would end up

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,400
competing with each other so you

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
basically set yourself up to be competed

117
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,599
against so a lot of times when clones

118
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,439
were shared they were they were shared

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,120
in different markets but they were also

120
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,199
clone crews that were pushing out tons

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,759
of weight and all pushing each other to

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
to brand a particular line kind of like

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
the northern lights stuff

124
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,439
um as you got into online

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,840
uh when overgrow was popping up and all

126
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,719
that you had a lot of people

127
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,478
that had amassed these small

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,400
little collections of clones during that

129
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,918
time some bigger than others but a lot

130
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,000
of them would amass these small clone

131
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,319
collections and um

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
provenance wasn't as much as a serious

133
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,800
thing back then

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,199
i see you saying clone hoarding over and

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,680
over and that's i'll get to it dude i'll

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,199
get to it for you um

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
but you see these people messy small

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
collections and as they would speak they

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
would learn to trust who was going to

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
keep their word on not passing said

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,399
clones and making it back into their

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,400
market and some people would just take

143
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,319
the clones and run and and do their own

144
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,638
thing rename it pretend like it's a new

145
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,719
thing and that's how we get to today

146
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,879
so as i entered

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,759
i wasn't i didn't have special stuff but

148
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,478
i was in california and unfortunately

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
there were a few places uh

150
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,519
what's

151
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,839
the best one i found was pnc it was a

152
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,879
dude named ape and i would say at least

153
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:44,000
80 plus of his of his things were legit

154
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,399
sourced he was a stray nerd like a lot

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,360
of us are still today and he did some

156
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,519
pretty good sourcing of a lot of og cuts

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,759
pure cushes

158
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,359
purples back then he did a really good

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,759
job sourcing i was just fortunate to be

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
in that area i also had a clone crew

161
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
that we were part of with the hogs

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,519
breath crew and in that circle people

163
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,560
were allowed to have the cut we weren't

164
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,879
allowed to compete we weren't allowed to

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,959
share and that was

166
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,719
that was super important we weren't

167
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,879
allowed to share with people outside the

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,240
group and that's how you ended up with

169
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,478
people like

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
you know the p91 crew the hogs breath

171
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,918
crew the bull rider crew

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,840
you ended up with all these different

173
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,519
crews with their one specific cut and

174
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,599
this is kind of before the og kush craze

175
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,079
when all that was going on once og kush

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,720
hit it was

177
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,959
it was a lot of fronting

178
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
a lot of pretending

179
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,279
a lot of fake sourcing

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
and it got really bad and and as the

181
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,719
online market

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
the online forums kind of blew up it

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,039
started to get more and more permeated

184
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,560
and a lot harder to verify sources

185
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,918
now most of the people that take this

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
seriously

187
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,598
take

188
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,520
provenance seriously in the first place

189
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,199
and when i say provenance i don't mean

190
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,839
anything more than

191
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
like like the term applies to art if you

192
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,879
if you have a painting that you have and

193
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,679
is signed by someone if you can't prove

194
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,319
where you got it from back to the artist

195
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
you've lost the provenance and therefore

196
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
it loses value

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,519
right

198
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
so

199
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,120
with clones it's very much the same

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
thing you could say i got this clone

201
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,959
from xyz but nobody knows how xyz got

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,399
that clone at that point it's broken and

203
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,598
people who are super serious about it

204
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,918
don't really want to trade with you and

205
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,240
they don't want to get in on it you know

206
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,240
um

207
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,598
so now we go to today

208
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,598
the trust in the market

209
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,800
is is all but gone

210
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,639
uh

211
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
people today tend to have popped up in

212
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
the last few years that are big in the

213
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,598
uh clone

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
trading scene that i'm noticing that

215
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,959
keep having the same mistakes

216
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,800
and it's because they're trading with

217
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,638
people that are new to the scene too but

218
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,560
have them convinced that they are legit

219
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
and connected to this guy or this guy or

220
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
this guy or this guy when it comes to me

221
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,799
and my friends we all know who we've

222
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,318
given clones to and who those people

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,598
have given clones to for the most part

224
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,360
there's always going to be exceptions to

225
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,240
the rule but for the most part we know

226
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,400
who has what clone of old [ __ ] who has

227
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,598
given it who had permission to get it

228
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,839
who didn't

229
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,759
all of the above and this still exists

230
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,519
this is still a [ __ ] thing

231
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,598
and people around

232
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,198
selling clones online

233
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,240
aren't a part of that those circles

234
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,478
they're not

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,000
they never they never were any of those

236
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,519
people selling clones online like that

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,519
with their big ass list like hey i got

238
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,759
all these [ __ ] clones [ __ ] source

239
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,120
from the breeder cut lovely these guys

240
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,559
are not people that would ever be

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
trusted with clones in the first place

242
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,679
from any of our circles not my circle

243
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
not the other circles that are old that

244
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,478
i'm not even a part of

245
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,158
no one's going to trust these dudes with

246
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,519
[ __ ] um

247
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,319
and that's where i'm seeing a lot of the

248
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,320
problems arise

249
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,838
check out your only radio ridge does

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,959
have a great only fans he's got this

251
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
great picture of his testicle amazing do

252
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,919
you know any verified cuts that look

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,039
distinctly different than in his picture

254
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,599
so

255
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,879
we get to the next topic verifying cuts

256
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
through pictures

257
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,240
there are a million reasons why this

258
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,399
can't and shouldn't be done and why you

259
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
don't see guys like me and inspector and

260
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
everyone trying to verify clones through

261
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
pictures

262
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,920
expressions and micro like in

263
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,240
microclimates and expressions things can

264
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,319
look totally different totally [ __ ]

265
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,919
different however there are a few cuts

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,600
that have certain traits that we know

267
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
always occur no matter what the uh

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
what the what the

269
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,039
expression is there are certain traits

270
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,039
that always pop out of certain clones um

271
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
the point being

272
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,919
you guys the best advice i could ever

273
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
give anyone is if you want to buy spend

274
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,679
money on a clone from someone chase that

275
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
[ __ ] all the way back to the breeder

276
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,679
they should be able to do that if they

277
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,600
can't do that then there's an issue

278
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,599
don't just take their word for it

279
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,839
because i've seen people saying some

280
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
wild [ __ ] [ __ ] that they're getting

281
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
past

282
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
chem 91 directly from a certain source

283
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,838
that didn't happen couldn't happen it

284
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,199
doesn't happen

285
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,279
um

286
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
and and it's it's sometimes it's hard to

287
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,439
get those answers but if you can't get

288
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,439
the answer then it's not worth getting

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
because every time i'm seeing people get

290
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,959
screwed

291
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,759
every time they go buy clones from these

292
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,679
doofuses they get screwed

293
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,679
so if they cannot trace the provenance

294
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,759
back to the original breeder there's a

295
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,599
problem and you probably

296
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,360
i mean you can always take the risk and

297
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,639
try but here's the thing if you're

298
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
taking a risk and trying but you've

299
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,399
never had the original clone how are you

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
ever gonna [ __ ] verify it and and

301
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,958
people with the chem 91 cut wouldn't be

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,039
selling it

303
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,919
not like that that's not how that works

304
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,919
so

305
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,838
uh yeah archive portland's a great place

306
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,439
to get clones archives as big a nerd as

307
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,680
anyone when it comes to provenance he

308
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,200
doesn't [ __ ] around so if you're getting

309
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,479
stuff from archive portland that's a

310
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
great source

311
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
um

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,958
but yeah i mean most of these kids are

313
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,000
just trading

314
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,479
clones

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
just trading with people who have no

316
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
access to anything and shouldn't have

317
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,360
access to anything and then some of

318
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,879
these dudes are cool and like they don't

319
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,680
understand this has gone on and they

320
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,039
repeat it and they repeat the story and

321
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,879
now someone else has that story and they

322
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,078
say but this guy is trustworthy yeah who

323
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,838
was the guy that you got it from was

324
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,639
that dude trustworthy probably not you

325
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
know

326
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,480
um

327
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,399
that is that is

328
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,399
the best advice i could ever give you

329
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,720
chase that [ __ ] up the chain

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,879
do not see places like harborside they

331
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
have people that they randomly get so

332
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,679
back in the day at least i don't know i

333
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,799
don't want to speak to now but back in

334
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,639
the day they would have random people

335
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,919
bring in clays or trays of clones or

336
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,199
they'd have their in-house cloner but

337
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,278
often they'd have people bringing trays

338
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,920
of clones you're trusting some random

339
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,559
ass that a bud tender trusted to bring

340
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,360
in clones and vet them

341
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,879
why why have you guys ever talked to bud

342
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,039
tenders

343
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,879
you know they know less than probably

344
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,879
you do even if you're a new person but

345
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,360
tenders don't get into provenance

346
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,838
sourcing any of that stuff if you want

347
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,200
to source something do it right

348
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,120
take the time meet people be friendly be

349
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,720
trustworthy don't be a snake and and

350
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,039
you'd be surprised how quickly things

351
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,519
open up i've told that to people from

352
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,639
day one and everybody wants to work it

353
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,639
around the around the back end i i can't

354
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
comment on finest because i don't i

355
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,320
i don't know who they source stuff from

356
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,320
etc but they've they've been very nice

357
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,120
and they've done great um tissue culture

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,399
work

359
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,759
but as far as

360
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,839
like

361
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,838
yeah i know yeah uh let's see

362
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:33,919
pre 90 379 500 a pop that blah blah that

363
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,480
pre-79 bubba

364
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
but yeah i mean

365
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,079
if you don't care

366
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
then you're adding to the problem

367
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,559
frankly that's that's really what it

368
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
what it comes down to if you don't care

369
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,838
and you're

370
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
passing these stories on without doing

371
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
the work then you're adding to the

372
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,959
problem

373
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,078
and that that's where i have a problem

374
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,518
and that's why you see all this

375
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,439
confusion in the market people throwing

376
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,919
up pictures of a chem 91 that don't look

377
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,240
like chem 91 you know maybe it's just a

378
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,120
really weird grow maybe they over blew

379
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,159
it but i see people commenting

380
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,560
in these in these [ __ ] threads let me

381
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,120
see for example let me see if i can find

382
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,039
it real quick

383
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
let me see

384
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,120
a good example

385
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
of someone oh you can't really see it

386
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,639
commenting in a thread that has no

387
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,199
[ __ ] clue what they're talking about

388
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,759
there's two currents guy he's new

389
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,519
he's probably newer than most of you

390
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,439
but he's telling acting like he has a

391
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,679
way that he can oh that might be a

392
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,600
[ __ ] hybrid i don't know

393
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,439
[ __ ] where did you source your

394
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
cam 91 to be making these judgments and

395
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,279
claims oh oh you didn't

396
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,360
oh you didn't oh did you say you sourced

397
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,399
it from one of my best friends

398
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,000
you're lying so it it's how it goes it

399
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,078
how it goes you know but then other

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,278
people don't know they see this dude

401
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,879
speaking in there they don't know that

402
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,639
he's a noob they don't know any of that

403
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,679
[ __ ] and they're like oh well if he says

404
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,680
it might be real then it might

405
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,759
that's how it goes

406
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,480
this is how the [ __ ] just spins on and

407
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,879
on and on and on how people set them up

408
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,440
up sell themselves up to be

409
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,519
a verifier of cuts when they have no

410
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,480
place verifying anything

411
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,600
um

412
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,959
and you like i said you'll be

413
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
hard-pressed to find someone that will

414
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,119
verify or shoot something down um i

415
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
could give you actually with with chem

416
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,519
91 i could give you a few pointers and i

417
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,278
know i've mentioned a few before

418
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,639
but um a few pointers leaf

419
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,639
cannibalization

420
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,399
that's nutrient burn that's not the

421
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
leafs cannibalizing themselves the one

422
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,958
trade it does seem to have is the never

423
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,198
ending white pistols but it looks like

424
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,239
someone just burned the [ __ ] out of uh

425
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:43,039
s1 or hybrid of chem 91

426
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,278
but in certain micro climates maybe

427
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,240
maybe it's hard to say

428
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,879
but i would feel much more confident

429
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,399
not even commenting on this thing

430
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,320
because there's no way there's no way to

431
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,078
know for sure unless it's got a lot of

432
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,480
the traits and it's missing one so what

433
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,159
can you do

434
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,639
anyway yeah i just wanted to give a

435
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,198
quick example um you know someone was

436
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,879
claiming to have a cut of archives

437
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,039
moonbow

438
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,720
oh cancel i didn't want to do that

439
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,799
someone was claiming to have a cut of

440
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
archives moonbow

441
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,159
well arc i've called him out on it and

442
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,799
then the guy's like oh no no no no i

443
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,240
mean i mean i had the breeder cut of uh

444
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,679
something else rainbow belts or

445
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,519
something it's another one that archives

446
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,399
not gonna pass cuts out his breeder cuts

447
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,679
out of

448
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,759
so be careful be careful who you trust

449
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,519
run these [ __ ] down

450
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,159
see what they know about

451
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,159
about sourcing cuts see who they're

452
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,439
dialed into circle wise

453
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,039
ask them

454
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,560
then glass some dudes in the circle

455
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,759
likely people will be honest with you

456
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,479
and tell you if they're in their circle

457
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,600
or not it's very easy to do

458
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,240
very [ __ ] easy to do

459
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,240
anyway

460
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,000
that's that's about what i wanted to run

461
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,759
down on that i think i think that it

462
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,879
used to be more common knowledge how you

463
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,720
did it you make friends

464
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,480
you get into circles

465
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
you don't get [ __ ] immediately because

466
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
everybody's been ripped off to [ __ ] you

467
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,639
know some people get mad that they can't

468
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,799
just get that clone immediately because

469
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
clone hoarders it's not fair you know

470
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,799
why it's not fair it's because [ __ ]

471
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,799
scammers rip everyone off

472
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,639
and it's been been that way since day

473
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,278
one been that way since day one so

474
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,519
people people that do have cuts are not

475
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,519
like super open to just some random new

476
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,600
guy who says hey i'm cool give it to me

477
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,039
i promise like that's been done for

478
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
years and years and years and years and

479
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,240
been heard for years and years and years

480
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,079
and it's a major trigger for a lot of

481
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
people um

482
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,159
people in these circles love to share

483
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,559
their clones

484
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,159
do i look way more serious

485
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,198
people in those in those circles love to

486
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,278
share their clones because they love

487
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,439
sharing dank with people

488
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,958
they don't necessarily like to openly

489
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,240
share clones with random people to

490
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,239
bastardize the clone

491
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,078
another good example of this had been

492
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,319
when everyone was trying to chase

493
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,239
joint breath for chems

494
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,839
you know i could i could go way further

495
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,000
into that but i'm not going to for the

496
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,199
sake of my buddy matt elite

497
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,119
not gonna

498
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,279
i'm not gonna talk about old p blood but

499
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,519
needless to say blind leading the blind

500
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,359
in that situation and people were still

501
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,599
paying joint breath for clones because

502
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,639
they really had that hope it's that fear

503
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,639
of missing out uh logical fallacy and

504
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,640
it's also the appeal to authority

505
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
logical fallacy both of those are there

506
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,919
the authority being oh well this guy's a

507
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,559
breeder he says he's a breeder and

508
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,799
and peat bud says he's legit

509
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,480
well that must mean these are legit

510
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,918
well how much do you know about how much

511
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,279
experience peabod's had with the actual

512
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,880
clones

513
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,399
uh

514
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
have you ever heard the story about him

515
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,960
bringing kim for as chem d to a cup and

516
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
entering it exactly

517
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,000
so

518
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,279
yeah

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,759
i shouldn't have probably gone that far

520
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,839
in but there's a point to it you can't

521
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,119
just trust everyone just because

522
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,359
someone's name is even linked with the

523
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,558
clone it's not necessarily a good reason

524
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,879
to

525
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,240
necessarily take their word on on clone

526
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
provenance

527
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,279
so yeah

528
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,279
anybody got any questions about that

529
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,480
the dog bud male exactly and people had

530
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
put his name behind a dog bud mill does

531
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,360
that make any sense [ __ ] no and

532
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,000
everybody else around him was telling

533
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,678
don't do that that dude's a liar that's

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,839
gonna be a problem and come back to

535
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,519
haunt you but sometimes money is just

536
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,480
too much of a

537
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,480
uh

538
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,360
yank i mean i really really liked bee

539
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,640
bud i did but i mean you know he was

540
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,639
backing someone who said they were gonna

541
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,880
murder me and someone who would say the

542
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,799
n word over and over and over you know i

543
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,960
can't deal with that i can't handle that

544
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,798
hopefully he's he's figured life out a

545
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,600
little better and who to run with and

546
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,599
who not to run with

547
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,720
oh i gotta go be going to church

548
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,840
just because i'm wearing a

549
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,839
long sleeve

550
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,360
mask g said he got a male knows that and

551
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,960
he's also said he didn't so

552
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,959
you know that comes back to it

553
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,200
i have a question where is the start of

554
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,038
the line to get my money back

555
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,038
you know

556
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,359
problem is many don't care

557
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,679
about history or the provenance that

558
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,519
make loot exactly and and a lot of

559
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
people in here are in here because they

560
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,720
do care about that and that's a point we

561
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
want to get everybody educated on the

562
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
same page

563
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,519
that oh no this is a

564
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
key lime lacroix

565
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,400
yeah these are the bomb that's pretty

566
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,400
much what i always drink

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,759
i haven't tried a fire sample of apple

568
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,879
fritter yeah i'm not a apple fritter guy

569
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,759
i've never

570
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,840
really

571
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,759
run that stuff so i can't comment on

572
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,359
apple fritter lumpy's giving me some

573
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,960
good cuts though before and they were

574
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,639
legit so

575
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,319
there is that

576
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,759
lumpy was a good source for the the

577
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,759
cookies and cherry pie early on

578

583
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,079

585
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,759

uh hand wound pickups that are going in

590

it look a little more gretchy sound a

591
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,240
little more gretchy

592
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,359
um

593
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,919
yeah this is one of the babies though

594
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,359
all bound it's the old epiphone

595
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
headstock which i wish it would have

596
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,879
been one of the new ones that look more

597
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,158
gibsony but it is so pretty

598
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
isn't it

599
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,960
just beautiful

600
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,879
i don't remember why i got it if i was

601
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,200
thinking i was going to play some mike

602
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,520
nest style stuff or what but

603
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
yeah i'm not usually i'm the less

604
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,599
pickups the better but this case i went

605
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,840
for all three

606
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,719
shit's

607
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,720
pretty it's in this case

608
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,879
anyway yeah

609
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,839
leave it up if you can um this is going

610
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,359
to be posted on patreon after this so if

611
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,519
you guys are on a re-watch

612
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,678
run it through the patreon stuff

613
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,720
yeah this isn't a gibson case too i

614
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,120
don't remember where i got the gibson

615
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,120
case at for that one

616
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,719
are you a neck or bridge pickup kind of

617
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,519
guy

618
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,720
neck mostly neck i like the neck sounds

619
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,720
for punk rock and garage

620
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,960
years from now i bet you're glad the

621
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
headstock is og yeah probably huh i just

622
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
think it's so much prettier the other

623
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,759
headstocks are so much prettier

624
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,919
but yeah i mean

625
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,158
i wanted a gibson one

626
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,600
but in the end after owning a bunch of

627
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,280
gibsons and a bunch of um epiphones

628
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,119
i've determined i like the necks better

629
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:03,359
on on um epiphone les pauls i don't know

630
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,759
why like they they have something closer

631
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,639
to a gibson sg type neck

632
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,038
from my experience and i like that nice

633
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,080
thin neck because i've got

634
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:18,000
little lady hands you know

635
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,000
the the i'm not familiar with the

636
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,359
what is the story around the two tim

637
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,520
there's way more way more way more cuts

638
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:30,000
of chem d than just two going around

639
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,679
yeah there's way more there's the sham

640
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,038
deed the chem d

641
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,320
the dirty d

642
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,000
the dead ringer the bundy sis and some

643
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,359
of these are the same cuts just renamed

644
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,119
100 times

645
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,079
so yeah i mean there's tons tons tons

646
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,000
tons

647
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,678
even bodhi said his chem 3 wasn't real

648
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,440
yeah

649
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,159

seriously i love bodhi um

700
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,400
radio ridge has been doing an amazing

701
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,798
job of sourcing legit genetics for a

702
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
long time and even before they even talk

703
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,000
about them they run them through a lot

704
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,919
of people to make sure that they have a

705
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
legit cut before they declare having any

706
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,440
kind of cut which

707
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,159
uh

708
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,759
yeah no it's the same guy black metal

709
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,799
you're definitely talking about the same

710
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,079
idiot

711
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,079
um

712
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,158
another dude let me give you another

713
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,678
example today and this is one that i

714
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,278
probably should have [ __ ] slapped

715
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,759
down much harder earlier on where is it

716
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,759
where's the fake bull rider well maybe i

717
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,158
don't have a picture of it ready

718
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,000
um

719
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,960
this one dude was showing fake pictures

720
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,480
of bull rider is this it

721
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,319
that

722
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,519
this dude

723
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,359
is dude nobody no no san diego

724
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,798
old-schoolers respect this dude have

725
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,959
ever heard of this dude before that um

726
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,079
he's a complete [ __ ] he had made

727
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,919
claims that he and his partner made

728
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,960
afghani bull rider and he didn't know

729
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559
that there was a difference between

730
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,038
afghani bull rider and original bull

731
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,319
rider so now since he's been made aware

732
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,119
of that he's now claiming he has

733
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,439
original bull rider which is dead

734
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,439
um

735
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,879
yeah there is that there is that little

736
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,158
situation that is not alive anymore

737
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,480
never mind that though that's just

738
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,360
details details details

739
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
um

740
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,359
yeah that if anybody wants a real bull

741
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,200
rider cut the closest you're gonna get

742
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,038
is old betsy and old betsy hybrids right

743
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,640
now um

744
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,400
and there's plenty of those available so

745
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,520
there's no reason to

746
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,759
uh even even [ __ ] with someone that

747
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,519
stupid heard of pnw strain hunter i have

748
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,879
not

749
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,440
i have not

750
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,640
where did skunk one originate from

751
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,798
uh

752
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,720
that's probably the most

753
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,440
known story in the history of cannabis

754
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,759
and most documented uh sam the skunk man

755
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,519
what is a true dg two blueberry people

756
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,558
say dj shorts i went through 23

757
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,599
blueberry cuts to find the one that

758
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,798
smells like sour milk and muffins

759
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,480
dj

760
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,359
was the one who popularized

761
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,440
the

762
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,879
line called blueberry but there have

763
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,080
been other cuts called blueberry that

764
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
didn't come from his stuff from around

765
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,199
the same time

766
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,798
so hopefully that helps

767
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,319
um

768
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:55,200
what else we got

769
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,200
writer is correct

770
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,879
yeah the rx farmer that was the afghani

771
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,918
bull rider i was referring to not the

772
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,720
old bull rider that i had in my backpack

773
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,720
back then it was called bulgani

774
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,759
yeah black metal i'm guarantee it's the

775
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,798
same dude same dude we've all been

776
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,240
talking about there's people in here

777
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,558
have been ripped off by that dude that

778
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,558
can tell you just as much it's not on my

779
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,558
word

780
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,319
anyway

781
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,159
what are some

782
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,359
old clones that are still around that

783
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
you would like to get your hands on

784
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,600
old clones that are still around i'd

785
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,520
like to get my hands on purple indica

786
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,038
but it's not even you know what like

787
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:44,558
even stuff like that

788
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:46,879
by uh via uh archive to csi csi is super

789
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,079
honest with clones and sharing and it

790
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,159
was asked not to share so i've still

791
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,558
never grown purple indica pure

792
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,278
so like a clone like that i'd be very

793
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,278
interested in

794
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,319
trying to think of some other one oh the

795
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,479
corn the corns another one i'd be really

796
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,839
interested in

797
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,599
um

798
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,119
let's see what is the relation of old

799
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,119
betsy and bull rider sister stock

800
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,278
the the the cuts came from the same

801
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,120
person so yeah

802
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,960
and guys like brandon rust wouldn't know

803
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,798
that [ __ ] so

804
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,038
but i bet after this he'll be repeating

805
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,879
it like it's [ __ ] some [ __ ] he always

806
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,398
knew

807
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,159
see that's a problem there are

808
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,119
double-edged swords to

809
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,320
uh

810
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,479
putting info out there like this

811
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,639
yeah i i ran some metal haze back in the

812
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,319
day from um dutch flowers we did some

813
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,360
metal haze crosses it's it's a very

814
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,839
interesting

815
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:47,119
uh line pretty sure it's positronics

816
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,359
haze 19 crossed a skunk one that

817
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,000
uh positronic sold for a long time and

818
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,000
it was renamed

819
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,480
baby yoda i've never even heard of baby

820
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,759
yoda to be selling it for a thousand

821
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,960
i mean

822
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,960
you know

823
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,798
again

824
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
it's possible to buy clones that are

825
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,480
legit

826
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,480
but know your sourcing always ask

827
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,960
questions don't just assume

828
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,278
like and i get it's very like you want

829
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,880
to be that one dude who can

830
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,359
source something

831
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,360
and and be like oh i'm the

832
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,119
be like i'm the one who got it yes i'm

833
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,119
one of the very few rare

834
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,639
people that have this rare cut but

835
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,199
nine times out of ten that's not going

836
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,679
to happen it just isn't

837

so tom hill hayes skunk one no

838
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,559
tom hill's haze was a selection from

839
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,759
positronics haze 19 but it probably was

840
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,599
nothing like the same pheno because

841
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,440
there were so many different phenos

842
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,798

855
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,880
both of them that i really really dug

856
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,239
how about that archive post dude selling

857
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,000

858
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,599
bit ago yeah it's it is what it is

859
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,759
that's what what kind of is is helping

860
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:25,038
foster these situations is is people

861
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,038
like that you know

862
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,640
but did el jefe verified cuts of his

863
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,640
elites so jeffe what jfe did was he made

864
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,919
it into our circle and i remember i was

865
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,600
talking about

866
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,880
uh people that get into circles and rip

867
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,119
people off and get booted out that's

868
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,640
exactly what he did um everybody in the

869
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:41,918
circle was very open with each other and

870
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,440
with clones

871
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,840
and

872
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
jefe got a lot of clones from everyone

873
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,959
in the group and ripped everyone off and

874
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,399
immediately started selling them against

875
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,000
everybody's wishes

876
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,759
um

877
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,278
he's one of the reasons

878
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,640
a perfect example of someone who's a

879
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,640
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] that does that

880
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,159
luckily he lost most of them

881
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
and um

882
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,039
and some of them he was handed were fake

883
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,240
so we can be thankful for that

884
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:07,919
but um

885
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,278
yeah

886
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,278
it's a shame it's a shame

887
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,880
what's a one cut that you haven't worked

888
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,640
with that you would grab if you could

889
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,159
i'll go with corn on that one just

890
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,278
because

891
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,360
yeah

892
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,640
if it was hilarious until he wasn't i

893
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,158
agree

894
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,120
um

895
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,679
he he damaged and burned every bridge he

896
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,359
possibly could have [ __ ] had

897
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,559
which made a lot of sense because he

898
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,398
when he came to our crew he didn't

899
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,359
really have any friends

900
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,158
porn is an old cut for uh that archive

901
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,519
has

902
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,960
you'd have to ask him what what it

903
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,319
actually is and the story behind it i

904
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,759
don't remember

905
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,038
what was purple pain there were a few

906
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,119
different purple pains but purple

907
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,879
champagne was supposed to be the the

908
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,839
derb the f1 dirt it's been called a

909
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,840
thousand different things so

910
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,360
stay trippy uh who is who is he

911
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,558
with the fake death star

912
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,479
i don't know

913
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,200
how big a fairy phenom variation would

914
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,480
you see in chem 91 s ones i haven't run

915
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,880
them but um just from observing people

916
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,720
pop them online and talking to csi it

917
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,720
sounds like it has a fairly good amount

918
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,000
of variation stuff that looks like sour

919
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,558
all the way to stuff looks like pure

920
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,558
afghani

921
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,480
i don't know what copy genetics is

922
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,159
double purple doja um

923
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
i don't

924
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,440
that was that's always been pretty rare

925
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
so if people pop up at the day i'm

926
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,759
always skeptical but um

927
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,159
fairfax selection according to icy mag

928
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,398
forums but there's more than one corn on

929
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,960
there a fair fact selection i'm not sure

930
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,678
it might be four-way selection

931
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,319
it could be could be did jeff take make

932
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,960
afghani bull rider i don't know i mean i

933
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,960
i i smoked it sold it after any bull

934
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,038
rider bud but i never really cared

935
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,720
because it like who did what because it

936
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,000
wasn't bull rider

937
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
didn't have anything to do with it i

938
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,599
don't think

939
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,759
how's the nl preservation project going

940
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,000
great going great

941
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,000
uh

942
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,519
death star i didn't know el jefe used a

943
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,038
death star

944
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,720
so i wouldn't know

945
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,200
um

946
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,120
i wouldn't know

947
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,360
that [ __ ] from woodshed was ridiculous

948
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,278
he brought that to a party uh i was the

949
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,158
first canned illuminati party and he was

950
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,599
just invited in to come to the party and

951
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,679
he showed up with his death star he'd

952
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,119
been [ __ ] banging on about how dank

953
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
it was and i took one look and one

954
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,038
smells like

955
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,159
[ __ ] you got skunk one you got

956
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,919
skunk one bro and if you can't tell that

957
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,000
you shouldn't be trading cuts

958
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,320
but yeah i don't know this is [ __ ]

959
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,319
funny

960
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,798
yeah that [ __ ] was garb though

961
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,720
i mean it was okay for skunk one but you

962
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,200
know it wasn't death star that's for

963
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,200
damn sure

964
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,600
didn't j i don't wanna i'm not gonna get

965
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,879
sit here talking about some [ __ ]

966
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,879
nobody the whole time

967
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,480
uh i'm looking forward to that project

968
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,319
too across the nl5 to one of those p91s

969
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,679
that's not a bad idea i think that could

970
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,679
be very nice like a

971
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,040
older afghani base

972
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,158
yeah that'd be really cool

973
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,759
i've already talked about that like i

974
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,079
said i'm not going to keep bringing up

975
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,280
or spending time on a [ __ ] nobody but

976
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359
yeah

977
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
death star og is great too i'm not sure

978
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,119
which one you're referring to or what

979
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,118
that is

980
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,158
um

981
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,358
yeah so that's that's a rough treatise

982
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,919
on

983
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,358
how you should verify cuts how you go

984
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,598
get these cuts

985
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,000
um

986
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,000
yeah it's really there's not a great

987
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,559
shortcut i'm sorry

988
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,398
it's not a great shortcut

989
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,639
sometimes it takes years to get a cut

990
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,838
and sometimes you'll never get it

991
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,838
just is what it is you can't

992
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,519
people calling things elites

993
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,159
has caused

994
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,159
a lot of

995
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,320
different ideas about what these cuts

996
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,559
are and how good they are everything is

997
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,079
subjective so

998
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,000
what i consider elite may not be what

999
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,440
you consider elite but back in the day

1000
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,960
it was a consensus value given to stuff

1001
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,358
if something kept getting passed because

1002
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,039
there wasn't the online hype system and

1003
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,639
instagram for pictures and what's what

1004
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,838
not if things kept getting passed it was

1005
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,039
because they were naturally hyping

1006
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,639
themselves because they were dank and

1007
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,079
after a certain point enough people

1008
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,239
agreed that this clone is dank that's

1009
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,920
how you got in a league cut nowadays

1010
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,399
it's anything that gets thrown on

1011
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,838
instagram that some hype schmuck wants

1012
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,838
you to think you know is legit

1013
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,838
okay what do you think the relationship

1014
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,039
between super skunk and chem is if any i

1015
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,599
think chem 91 is a pure super skunk

1016
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,159
um that's just my best guess but pretty

1017
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,838
pretty sure on that one

1018
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,358
first class genetics is the number one

1019
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,519
in legit cuts i'm glad you know that

1020
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,119
because i i don't i don't i don't know

1021
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,960
that i'm sure the guy's nice but i i

1022
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,079
just he's not in our circle so i don't

1023
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,760

1024
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760

1028
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,239
real cut of gainesville green in my life

1029
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,240
uh i've seen a lot of fake cuts of it

1030
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,838
anything about fire alien ramen that was

1031
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,838
og rascal and it was a seed line

1032
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,480
oh you have cuban black haze cool that's

1033
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,159
what i was talking about like that

1034
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,760
incognito guy that's one of the ones he

1035
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:36,239
brought to the table along with ken

1036
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,040
three and fake mass super skunk so

1037
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,479

y'all getting y'all getting skunked

1039
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,320
y'all getting skunked

1040
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,078
um we got some stuff first class i can

1041
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,640

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,440
good see that's a that's a good good

1043
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,799
call

1044
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,320
as long as this stuff you know what it

1045
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,920
is in the first place before you get it

1046
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,079
otherwise i mean

1047
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,680
things can be

1048
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,240
this is where some confusion also comes

1049
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,000
in because things can be dank right you

1050
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,838
can get a fake clone that's super dank

1051
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,760
probably even better

1052
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,880
than the than the clone only however

1053
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,800
does that make it legit

1054
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,000
you know you have to know the

1055
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
you have to be able to identify

1056
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
something in the first place before you

1057
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,000
can uh

1058
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,599
verify it

1059
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,039
yeah you just gotta know you have to

1060
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,760
know it in advance

1061
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,639
what's the difference in amherst sour

1062
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,640
aj salary csd

1063
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,960
amherst sour

1064
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,159
new to me i mean like i get like people

1065
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,159
were saying it was from amherst so

1066
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,519
someone smacked amherst on the front of

1067
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,598
a sauerkraut i don't know anything about

1068
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,159
that sauerkraut i only know ecsd the

1069
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,680
choco same thing

1070
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:45,838
the aj sour was very dank but what aj uh

1071
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:51,598
considers his sour

1072
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:53,279
now was nothing like the old aj sour cut

1073
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,200
so yeah

1074
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,200
salt and lime never heard of that no

1075
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,358
see like the cuban black case a lot of

1076
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,519
people like it

1077
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,719
but is that what it is

1078
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,639
i don't know

1079
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,239
don't know i know where it came from and

1080
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,679
i know that

1081
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,199
it

1082
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,279
i know the provenance on it and that

1083
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,039
that guy passed two other fake cuts when

1084
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,480
he passed that cut

1085
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,920
so yeah

1086
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,000
yeah the archive cut of sour would be

1087
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,400
the same thing as the choco the ecst et

1088
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
cetera

1089
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,560
so those are the same exact cuts

1090
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,719
if you're comparing archives versus

1091
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,079
choco they're the same cuts who was the

1092
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,519
original train wreck so the original

1093
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,599
train wreck

1094
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,559
supposedly was nothing like the train

1095
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,680
wreck that got pushed by ae

1096
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,279
32

1097
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,118
in the arcade train wreck it was much

1098
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
different before that but the one that

1099
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,400
gets passed the most is like that lemony

1100
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
torpedoing one

1101
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,519
and that's what most people

1102
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,280
yeah

1103
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,159
mandel crotch put the amherst on the

1104
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,240
name again no surprise

1105
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,799
do i think the aj sour i used was the

1106
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,279
original sour no i think the choco ecst

1107
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,200
is the original sour i do

1108
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,519
but i mean

1109
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,960
who knows again that's not one we can

1110
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,079
take back to the total beginning because

1111
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,320
there's no

1112
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,320
true

1113
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,199
there's no true like agreement between

1114
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,760
the original guys that had this hour

1115
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,358
on what that sour is now

1116
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,400
i don't think any of them could identify

1117
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,838
it today by any stretch of imagination

1118
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
and we tried we tried to get him to do

1119
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,838
it so

1120
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,838
yeah

1121
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,239
found an incredible train wreck fino in

1122
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
bubble gum breath crosses

1123
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,719
that me

1124
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,960
why is there a train wreck fino's in

1125
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,559
bubble gum breath crosses that's weird

1126
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
i i maybe i don't know what bubbling

1127
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,519
breath is

1128
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,679
little timers in amherst that said it

1129
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,280
was the original sour originally from

1130
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,199
new york upstate it is from new york

1131
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,400
upstate but it was not called

1132
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,159
uh

1133
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,639
amherst sour no one's ever called it

1134
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,239
amherst sour back then uh

1135
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,920
as far as i know it was called our

1136
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:08,078
diesel and that's the original name

1137
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,480
so yeah i mean people can call whatever

1138
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,240
they want but they shouldn't if they're

1139
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,679
talking about original sour

1140
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,679
it's not super debatable

1141
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:20,719
possibly a couple sours at first though

1142
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,519
yes

1143
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,759
yeah

1144
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:27,039
yeah and the other original name for it

1145
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,040
was the manny from those guys so

1146
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,039
there is also that

1147
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,400
i don't know what mendo breath is

1148
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,920
basically mendo perps and train wreck

1149
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,800
men of breath is not

1150
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,000
mendo perps and train wreck bro it's og

1151
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,119
kush breath

1152
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,960
and uh

1153
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,119
probably a

1154
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,400
mental purpose train wreck but og kush

1155
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,400
breath being the main part of it

1156
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,079
cam dog had fake chem 91 in high times

1157
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,960
why would you trust any what any of them

1158
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,079
say

1159
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,519
that's hard

1160
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,960
hard to argue with

1161
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:04,719
are there land races that get as

1162
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,720
commonly knocked off as ties

1163
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,400
i don't know on that one

1164
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,119
i mean i don't i don't know

1165
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,599
in your opinion what breeders are

1166
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,680
killing it right now and why um a few

1167
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,240
episodes ago i did a long list of

1168
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,719
breeders that are are people that i

1169
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,199
trust and that are doing some cool [ __ ]

1170
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:28,239
so yeah that you hit back a few episodes

1171
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,239
and you could probably find that

1172
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
moon tide that's a good

1173
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,599
that's

1174
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,240
another fair statement like like those

1175
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,760
those smells don't necessitate a lot

1176
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,358
more than

1177
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,200
most of the things associated with like

1178
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,199
the skunk files and stuff like that

1179
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,078
skunky dials are hermaphroditic

1180
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,639
tendencies and low potency and that's

1181
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,880
for for real

1182
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,440
but people want what they don't know and

1183
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,440
can't have

1184
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,760
so many old elites look like ugly ass

1185
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,559
plants i guess terps and highs were a

1186
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,920
bit more important for a lot of them

1187
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,880
um

1188
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,280
i think in modern times people equate

1189
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,599
looking good with dankness

1190
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,400
um that would be the instagram era of

1191
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,480
growers and i don't agree with that at

1192
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,639
all not even a little bit some of the

1193
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,920
most beautiful [ __ ] like blackberry kush

1194
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,960
is some of the

1195
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,119
worst

1196
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,599
potency

1197
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,119
on earth like you know mental purpose is

1198
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,280
[ __ ] beautiful

1199
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,720
not super potent you know but it has

1200
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,319
great terps

1201
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,358
um

1202
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,239
yeah

1203
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,880
there's any name any cookies hybrid i

1204
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:42,879
don't think it's that [ __ ] great but

1205
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,880
it's pretty so it sells yeah

1206
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,039
um i'm not sure yet pyramid i haven't

1207
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,440
run any yet

1208
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:55,960
that's right gene geno's what's up

1209
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,960
can't smoke with your [ __ ] eyes boys

1210
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,079
yeah it's uh

1211
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,039
it's like the people that that run tests

1212
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,160
and think that's a great example of

1213
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,920
uh

1214
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,000
how to pick your weed and what to sell

1215
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,119
by thc volume but you know they did

1216
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
people haven't even looked at the

1217
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,680
entourage effect at all

1218
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,679
um

1219
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,719
hog's breath is a beautiful example

1220
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,078
isn't it yeah it's not it wasn't the

1221
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,239
most gorgeous but it was one of those

1222
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,240
ones that hyped itself because it was

1223
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,358
[ __ ] dang

1224
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,358
that's absolutely true

1225
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,400
mean [ __ ] a gene

1226
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,719
we're gonna get jean on here eventually

1227
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,800
eventually he will do it he will do it

1228
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,719
and come hang out and shoot the [ __ ]

1229
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,119
do you think microbes and fungi and soil

1230
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,199
contribute to the flavor of weed i think

1231
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,200
uh the root zone is where

1232
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,679
it does all that that exchanging of

1233
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,039
stuff so sure i think sulfur

1234
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,199
um

1235
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,358
added sulfur helps with with terps and

1236
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,078
stuff like that um

1237
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,519
yeah favorite came to smoke

1238
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,039
i liked chem one because it was so

1239
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,679
different than the other chems and i

1240
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,639
like uh diesel other than that if we're

1241
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,519
just saying like just cam chems

1242
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,199
well

1243
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:15,440
i guess that would depend on what chem

1244
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:18,318
is right uh chem 91 no 5 haze chem 4

1245
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,318
is one of my other phase

1246
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,440
what's a strain that subverted your

1247
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,119
expectations because of how ugly it was

1248
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,000
colombian black

1249
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,559
it was beautiful to me because i knew

1250
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,358
its potential but it was just an airy

1251
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,279
mess of tiny little

1252
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,759
um

1253
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,160
tiny little

1254
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,680
bubbles of bud everywhere

1255
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,679
but it was it was amazing smoke

1256
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,560
yeah the lot has a lot of that same look

1257
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,079
that like the colombian black did just

1258
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,039
stringy

1259
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,079
you know

1260
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,679
um a lot like uh

1261
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,119
what people called grinspoon that was

1262
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,118
originally quays

1263
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,160
what happened a good widow

1264
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,680
probably the same thing that happened

1265
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,679
with everything else from the 90s people

1266
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,879
just overdid it got sick of it lots of

1267
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,480
renames

1268
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,440
um

1269
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,358
lots of bad impressions of weed that was

1270
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,559
not widow

1271
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:13,920
stuff like that

1272
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,920
how do you feel now that tissue culture

1273
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,838
has really started to gain momentum and

1274
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,838
become more available with honest people

1275
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,480
ask fatty i haven't ever since i got

1276
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,240
screwed by by mooney moon dog on on

1277
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,000
tissue culturing i've stayed so far away

1278
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,000
from it and don't care

1279
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
because it's just a bad experience but i

1280
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,800
know my boy fatty's been doing some some

1281
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,800
cool [ __ ] with it

1282
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,358
uh dog walker og is kind of ugly but

1283
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,800
smokes fantastic i i think he's kind of

1284
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,799
pretty it smokes great though

1285
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,800
he got he did not get the cut from grace

1286
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,480
goal

1287
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,079
brandon did not get the cut from

1288
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,679
grayskull because grayskull doesn't have

1289
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,280
the [ __ ] cut grayscale will tell you

1290
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,279
he doesn't have the cut i had the last

1291
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,040
of grayscale's bull rider seeds and they

1292
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,400
weren't going to pop so they had to take

1293
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,838
him to a

1294
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,440
tissue culture guy not sure what's up

1295
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,039
with that since then but brandon did not

1296
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,079
get [ __ ] from

1297
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,239
[ __ ]

1298
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,359
grayskull grace wouldn't

1299
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:14,078
never [ __ ] with that kid god wouldn't

1300
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,400
say but i mean and again brandon rust is

1301
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,920
a noob but people just think for some

1302
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,160
reason because he says he's not that he

1303
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,159
isn't

1304
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,199
people are liars you gotta ask the

1305
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,800
people themselves

1306
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,078
why don't you ever smoke weed during la

1307
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,318
is one i don't want to get them shut

1308
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,079
down too i can't answer fast if i'm

1309
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,119
stoned

1310
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,560
just can't i've tried a few live and uh

1311
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,240
stoned and that just doesn't work out

1312
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,119
well

1313
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,479
so

1314
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,680
either you want info or you want me

1315
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,960
stoned one of the two

1316
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,960
but you can't have both

1317
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,318
yeah i don't know that gray ever had

1318
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,720
bull rider um he had the seeds that we

1319
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,920
had here and that's the bag seed and

1320
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,480
that was that

1321
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,480
as far as i know

1322
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,598
so yeah

1323
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,960
know what you're talking about don't

1324
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,400
just trust people because they say

1325
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,960
they're legit and old school and they

1326
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,639
show a picture of a plant and veg saying

1327
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
it's something

1328
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,920
don't

1329

going great going great they overgrew

1344
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,318
everything really fast it's obviously

1345
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,039
some kind of afghani hybrid which is

1346
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,838
what we want from uh uh nl5

1347
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:59,519
um

1348
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,799
that

1349
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,719
gives more truth to what it's supposed

1350
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,720
to be because we are always going to

1351
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,799
keep making sure that it is what we

1352
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,719
think it is

1353
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,280
do you know what steve murphy afghani is

1354
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,879
yeah afghani or actually that as it was

1355
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,319
told to me it could be a pakistani or

1356
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,920
afghani they weren't sure it was a girl

1357
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,920
who went over and brought them back to

1358
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,680
steve murphy so it could be pakistani

1359
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,720
afghani but she was so it was picked up

1360
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,558
somewhere along that line

1361
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,639
weasel with the diesel say sour d came

1362
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,839

00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,519
northern lights

1364
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,199
so weasel with the diesel has told so

1365
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,960
many different stories

1366
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:36,558
respect to him nice dude but i

1367
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,760
i've heard too many different stories

1368
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,119
coming out of dude's mouth to be very

1369
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,559
reliable but we do know vondo and vondo

1370
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,079
has been the most reliable and

1371
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,359
consistent when it comes to stories

1372
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,200
about the sour

1373
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,838
and um

1374
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,919
and yeah weasel with the diesel knows

1375
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,719
vondo too and they were roommates but

1376
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,639
he's been the most consistent and out of

1377
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,239
the spotlight wants nothing to do with

1378
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:02,799
any fame

1379
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:04,879
glory from northern or from sour so yeah

1380
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,200
how was golden coast vintage afghani it

1381
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,720
was a short squat

1382
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,919
little creamy

1383
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,919
hashy afghani

1384
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,838
nothing great

1385
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,039
but uh it was

1386
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,679
pretty anything about cause i don't even

1387
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:22,079
know who cosmic wisdom is sorry

1388
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,078
um

1389
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,800
uh would we get a shawnee kid he just

1390
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,959
did an episode with me

1391
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,880
how would you describe the nose on

1392
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,280
instructure on pakistani to troll kush

1393
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,400
depending on

1394
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,559
uh

1395
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,800
depending on the phenotype you can get

1396
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,400
like blackberry the green fino showed a

1397
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,640
lot of lemon and there's a lot of

1398
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,000
terpenoline mixed in but there's other

1399
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,039
notes too

1400
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,800
um

1401
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,318
yeah caleb would be the person i mean

1402
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,720
csi would be the person to talk about

1403
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:57,440
that anywhere vondo's story can be found

1404
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:00,000
we brought vondo into our circle and

1405
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,440
interviewed him extensively and i just

1406
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,559
told it to you so

1407
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,000
that's about the best place you're going

1408
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,839
to get unless you're friends with them

1409
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,318
so do you believe that sour cake from

1410
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,719
head sour came from headband

1411
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:14,960
those guys can't even agree on who

1412
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:17,039
named headband let alone um

1413
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,559
any of it i've watched

1414
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,599
several people from that group including

1415
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,040
ajj and and maybe one of them did name

1416
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,359
it but

1417
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,440
jj says he's named it aj said he's named

1418
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,880
it and i believe klopp said he's named

1419
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,960
it uh

1420
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,760
weasel so

1421
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,358
who knows who knows maybe one of them

1422
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,680
did maybe one of them didn't

1423
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:39,440
but sour was before that so it would

1424
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,519
make it very hard for sauer to come from

1425
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,599
headband how do you pick a name for a

1426
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,079
strain

1427
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,400
don't ask me i come up with dumb ass

1428
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,400
names

1429
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,519
if you're if you have autism and you're

1430
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,240
trying to make friends and be social for

1431
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,400
cuts that's gonna be pretty hard um find

1432
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,078
a group that understands that i mean

1433
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,400
we're all

1434
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,318
i would be hard-pressed to find a group

1435
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,160
of

1436
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,838
seed makers that are real serious into

1437
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,759
this and real serious into collecting

1438
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,599
that aren't on the spectrum in some way

1439
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,480
shape or form

1440
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,359
um

1441
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,199
most of my best friends have some

1442
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,239
level of

1443
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:23,358
autism spectrum

1444
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,439
blackberry was a backseat by soma blaze

1445
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,358
correct probably mendo perps

1446
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,039
um all of it's probably meadow perks you

1447
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,440
can find everything that they described

1448
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,039
as blackberry and mendo perps so

1449
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,838
i'm guessing it's meadowpurp's bag seed

1450
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,838
that they didn't want to

1451
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:41,039
admit favorite terpenoline dominant

1452
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,318
clone um i really like the amnesia haze

1453
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,639
uh

1454
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,719
um the colombian black that's another

1455
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,400
one

1456
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:49,519
fly deport and ship yourself some yeah

1457
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,960

that's there you go

1459
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,639

1463
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,400

blackberry and anima's blackberry was

1470
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,838
probably from mendo perps

1471
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,839
what makes an og and ogn are there so

1472

1473
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,119
just about there being similar traits

1474
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:28,799
and a bad seed story yes

1475
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,079

1476
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,079
blood durbin csis i do not

1477
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,200

1478
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,199
cushions out there

1479
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,558

1482
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,039
hebrews

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,559
the other cans it's not super what

1486
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,000
people would associate with kenny

1487
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,680
however

1488
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,800
i think it would be great in a cross

1489
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,719
with dog [ __ ] because they are both nl5

1490
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,680

1491
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,039
there too

1492
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,558

a um

1533
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,199
in a lineage like that where there's no

1534
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,559
number to it no nothing and knowing

1535

dank but i couldn't never use it in

1539

anything because i just wouldn't can't

1540
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,640
chase the provenance on it and i can't

1541
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,519
say what it is unless it was super

1542
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,519
exceptional you know

1543
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,079
i'd be surprised if anyone remembered

1544
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,040
anything after hitting circle that's

1545
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,599
true

1546
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,599
that's true

1547
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,559
have you ever seen any ethiopian strains

1548
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,039
making its way up yeah there's people

1549

before i don't know much about it in

1552
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,240

know about the one that he's using

1559
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,960
uh anything about dr atomic been trying

1560
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,720
to get him on the the show we'll see how

1561

uh did you get your f1 dirt back nope

1563
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,078
not yet any idea what the harsh chemical

1564
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,760
spray paint permanent marker fumes type

1565
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,280
smells could come from

1566
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,520
different terpenes combinations of

1567
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,319
thiols terpenes

1568
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,440
esters etc

1569
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:58,480
who is real humboldt seed company

1570
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,720
hso hsc csi well

1571
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,400
csi is a humboldt original

1572
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,639
hsc was the first person to have

1573
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,000
humboldt seed co but i have no respect

1574
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:12,000
for them for many other reasons and hso

1575
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,159
split off i thought i think i may be

1576
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,760
wrong but as i've heard it's one of the

1577
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,960
people split off from humbled seedco and

1578
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960
started humboldt seeds org

1579
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,480
where does the african haze come from

1580
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,838
which african haze there's like senegal

1581
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,639
haze that was a combination of two

1582
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,599
african land races with no haze in it

1583

yeah i don't know

1585
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,838
yeah i've been trying i've been working

1586
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,798
on dr atomic but he's not he's not a big

1587
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:42,798
internet dude so it's been a little um

1588
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,159
hard but i think it would be i think

1589
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,880
he'd be a great person to interview he's

1590

1592
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:56,239
bubble man mentioned the clones dog game

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,838
we're covered in p.m

1594
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,838

working with

1600
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,640
any other questions about provenance

1601
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,760
clones

1602
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,759
genetics in general

1603
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,760
anything that i might know about

1604
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,640
have you tried any transki south african

1605
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,760
strains i have tried transki tried swazi

early in the early on durbin um i wasn't

1607
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,680
a big fan of south africans if i'm being

1608
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,798
honest like they tended to be

1609
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,879
high

1610
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,000
high yielding commercial grade for

1611
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,280
africa

1612
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,679
which is

1613
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,680
you know

1614
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,400

dressed up for you

1616
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,479
let's see

1617
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,640
thoughts on reversal sometimes plants

1618
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,880
don't sack up they're more look like

1619
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,558
bananas normal

1620
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,000
yeah um different reversals go different

1621
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,760
ways did st george make girl scout

1622
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,719
cookies absolutely not that's a [ __ ]

1623
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,640
story

1624
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,239
um but it is a story that keeps being

1625
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,838
spread nonetheless i've actually tried

1626
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,078
to get a hold of him to put his story on

1627
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:18,159
the record and they will not do it

1628
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,680
will not put it on the record but it

1629
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:24,078
would be easily trounced

1630
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,879
um i did ask the original cookies dudes

1631
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,240
to

1632
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,519
uh

1633
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,558
talk about it and we'll see hopefully

1634
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,798
they will hopefully they'll be

1635
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,119
interested in it what terpene or combo

1636
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:37,159
of terpenes make blueberry smell

1637
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,160
mercene and then different

1638
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,039

um

1657
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,960
i think that the people who made cookies

1658
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:28,960
know what it is but don't really

1659
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,480
don't really want to put the full recipe

1660
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:36,239
out there

1661
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,679
i it's very easy to remake cookies

1662
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,719
so

1663
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:41,118

1667
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:49,039
yeah i don't know it's one of those

1668
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,719
things where

1669
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:52,880
uh so many people want to take credit

1670
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,039
for it that there's so much [ __ ] out

1671

that was already when i stopped when

1691
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,599
that plot came out i had already stopped

1692
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:46,399
paying attention to everything like the

1693
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,400
new people were doing

1694
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,160
any work with you in small boat on the

1695

1701
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,680
one of the friends i hope it'd be nice

1702
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,440
to see him get back to it also because

1703
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,798
he grew really dank we need always bring

1704
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,480
it to me

1705
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,400
you think cookie's og i think there's a

1706
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,599
little bit more to it but i think most

1707
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,519
of these expressions that you see in

1708
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,519
cookies is an og oracle combination

1709
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,880
yeah you know um eddie leapfrog was

1710
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,960
responsible for a grain sherb

1711
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,318
uh that is different than the cookie fam

1712
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,519
shirt

1713
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,880
um

1714
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,039
one is more responsible for skittles one

1715
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,318
is just not

1716
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,519
that's why there's a lot of confusion

1717
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:42,480
around that i've heard m39 yes skunk one

1718
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:44,159
uh and then another skunk one

1719
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,880
northern light five haze or just skunk

1720
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:49,199
one and all five i can't remember um i

1721
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,760
think it's skunk one in all five haze

1722
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,759
some combo thereof

1723
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:59,199
the male pakistani chatrol was an urkel

1724
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,279
morph get out of here with that [ __ ]

1725
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:04,558
yeah out of that yeah that's [ __ ]

1726
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:08,640
silly that is silly

1727
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:11,440
basic five is the nl5 version

1728
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,879
that ssc was using in

1729
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,639
m39

1730
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,079

1732
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,559
skunk haze

1733
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,838
i think what's the optimal thc cbd

1734
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:25,440
church percentage it depends on what you

1735
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:25,440
want out of it for your body chemistry

1736
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:31,358

ask the same question over and over even

1740
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,318
though he keeps passing it

1741
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,240
uh

1742
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:42,000
i don't know what you're referring to

1743
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,598

uh that's the most honest answer i can

1755
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,838
get because there's tons of phenos it's

1756
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,119
a poly hybrid

1757
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:12,719
what regs you got for something you'd

1758
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,240
recommend any of the blue bonnet stuff

1759
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,399
i'm happy with all of it it just depends

1760
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,239
on what you like out of weed that's the

1761
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,400
the most honest answer i can give you

1762
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:20,399
know

1763
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:24,078
best way to stabilize a home that's a

1764
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,279
winner it just depends on the actual

1765
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,880
clone

1766
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,880
um it depends on what you want to get

1767
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,720
out of it if you want an uh something

1768
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,000
that is as close to that clone as

1769
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,759
possible it's going to take lots of

1770
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,798
breeding

1771
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,039
what out of your current line what's

1772
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:40,159

i'm a big fan of blue like berry ogs and

1777
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,838
stuff i think they combine really well

1778
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,920
especially if you get that like

1779
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,838
fruit loopsy fino out of the og pushing

1780

01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,960
[ __ ]

1782
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,078
how do you stabilize a herm it depends

1783
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,000
on the line

1784
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:07,039
it's not there's no just one

1785
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,639
method for stabilizing all herms terms

1786
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,599
things hurt for different reasons and

1787
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,960
different lines and different

1788
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,720
combinations

1789
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,639
the blabba kush i too loved blue bubba

1790

1794
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:22,880
green crap crossed a tree dog

1795
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,480
nobody knows the true origin of the

1796
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,480
skittles gene would know he's up there

1797
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:29,599
with those dudes

1798
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,358
it's up for debates apparently

1799
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,280
i know some people are more confident

1800
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,199
confident about it than others can you

1801
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,160
talk about bubble gum and how it got to

1802
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:37,439
holland

1803
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,279

victor if i remember correctly victor

1805
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,920

01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:46,639
seeds you can find it on adam dunn's

1807

1809
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,079
um

1810
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,000
two trees on and that was the most

1811
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,160
legitimate as far as i know the most

1812
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,838
legitimate story that has been given

1813
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:00,239
about that

1814
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,199
would you say seedfinder.you has legit

1815
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:03,038
info

1816
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,719
sometimes i mean anybody could add any

1817
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,160
info i've never added a single strange

1818
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,798
seed fighter and all my shit's up there

1819
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:10,879

so anybody could add info up there and

1821
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,640
if anybody could add info up there then

1822
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,640
there's bound to be right and wrong

1823

1842
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:57,199
source than it was at one time i have

1843

what strains are great for headaches any

1854
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,679

cross to the west coast dog

1866
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,400
uh trying to remember the moment it's

1867
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,318

1868
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,119

real green crack

1870
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,639
it's a green crack's pretty easily easy

1871
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,639
to identify visually or smoking wise

1872
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,440
is green sherb also called key lime pie

1873
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,200
some people call it that some people say

1874
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,960

1876
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,280
in my hands called green sherb so i

1877
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,599
don't know

1878
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,000
uh not sure

1879
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,680
jean might know that one better

1880
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,358
butterscotch g13 g13 wasn't around when

1881
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:31,759
the butterscotch wine was passed around

1882
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,239
but there was a g13 hash plant that was

1883
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,520
as anyone yes dukey bros kettes gills

1885
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:41,759
that is the skittles cut that i know

1886
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:44,558

1887
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,680
healthy looking plant

1888
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,839
it's a little

1889
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:49,838
wiry and wrangly i don't know

1890

gene and and and csi that are up in that

1893
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,399
area

1894
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,760
because they're actually interacting

1895
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,200
with those folks down on the ground

1896
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,160
there and seeing things like down on the

1897
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,000
ground

1898
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:12,239
and they'd be much better to answer

1899
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,239

1900
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,920

1903
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,279
terpy but

1904
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,600
it just structure wise it's a piece of

1905
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,600
[ __ ]

1906
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:32,079

1930
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:34,880
african something project 19

1931
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:36,079

1932
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,079

1933
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:40,238

1936
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,039
give him a call

1937
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,039
we live close together and we've been

1938
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,798
friends for quite a while um

1939
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,198
i guess burning bush nursery said key

1940
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:53,439
lime came from them and it's a gsc fino

01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,319
hash plant looking thing

1942
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:58,799

1943
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:02,000
the the key lime pie cut they were very

1944
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,320
very frosty but they did look i they

1945
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,479
looked very skittles-y and the skittles

1946
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,079
looked very similar to that

1947
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:09,279
that

1948
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:13,198
the cut that

1949
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:15,198

01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,920
males and world filo taxi what gives i

1953
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,399
see it often on males in some lines

1954
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,520
specifically chem 91 pck f2 it's

1955
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,439
interesting

1956
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,280
it's not like necessarily a male trait

1957
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:38,479
but maybe it's something from those

1958
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:38,479
specific genetics being

1959
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:49,119
combined favorite shitty strain there

1960
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:51,198
you go ortega's sweet

1961
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,960
i take a sweet tooth but what's the

1962
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:54,158
where's the project 19 in it in

1963
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,119
blockhead

1964
01:10:54,158 --> 01:11:00,158
is it project 19 or take a sweet tooth

1965
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,158
that might be what it is

1966
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,440
that might be what it is but i remember

1967
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,279
ortega sweet tooth you are correct about

1968
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:10,319
that being in it wasn't that louie

1969
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:12,479
so is it p19 louis

1970
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,158
louis being legends ultimate indica

1971
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,238
since that's what ortega's sweet tooth

1972
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:16,238
is

1973
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,760
i can't remember

1974
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,759
i can't remember at all

1975
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,678
or is it just p19 sweet tooth

1976
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,880
is giddle skunk one dominant no not

1977
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:34,000
structure at all

1978
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,600
um

1979
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,119
terps i could see some skunk one in it

1980
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,520
but i wouldn't say it's skunk one

1981
