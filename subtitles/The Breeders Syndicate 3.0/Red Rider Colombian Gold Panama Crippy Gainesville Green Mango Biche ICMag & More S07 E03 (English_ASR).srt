same age so you were smoking in the 70s

74
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,039
and and uh and early 80s and and you

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,900
were telling your stories about what it

76
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,120
was like

77
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,519
um you know your early days when you

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,620
first got high and you know some

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
different experiences and places you

80
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,700
moved around campus can you tell us a

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,259
little bit about kind of those early

82
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,658
days and

83
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,840
um how you got into weed

84
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:45,000
oh sure uh oh one more thing we've done

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,060
this dude ranch in Colorado when I was

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,340
about 10 years old and uh that was my

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,259
first experience seeing cannabis I

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,239
didn't smoke it or get high but I I

89
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,539
noticed it was that they said it was

90
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,580
even Colombian but uh we had a campfire

91
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,378
everybody was sitting around and they

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,120
were smoking it the older guys and

93
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:04,979
everything and they really had a really

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,459
good experience with it

95
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,798
and of course it was a a few years later

96
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,319
when I actually smoked some and got high

97
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,360
but uh that was later when I I think it

98
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,699
was a very similar story to like you

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,340
were talking about where after school I

100
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,478
I was riding home on the bus and this uh

101
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,698
guy had some joints for sale and uh

102
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,620
he said it's really really good man I

103
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,960
and and I gave him a dollar bought two

104
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,759
of them it was wrapped in nice pink

105
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,219
rolling papers

106
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,439
and uh when I got out the school bus I

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,940
had like a little Entourage with me you

108
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,300
know that was wanting to see what

109
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:44,399
happened when we smoked it and uh we

110
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,620
went out in the woods and and uh that

111
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,779
was when I first really felt it and

112
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,720
realized this is something I wanted to

113
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:54,779
keep with me in my life Wow

114
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,540
but it was Mexican the first time you

115
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,159
know I'm sure you remember

116
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,680
oh I remember that whole that whole

117
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,139
picture you just painted man I I can I

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,660
can still I can picture the joints you

119
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,759
know the paper looked like it was so

120
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,160
thick you know you couldn't see anything

121
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,460
through it and the ends were probably

122
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,320
spun and twisted and if if it unspun the

123
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,500
whole thing would just dump out you know

124
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,300
because it was powdery in there and and

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,038
the kids I can't even imagine the

126
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,079
excitement of the kids kind of chasing

127
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,538
along trying to find a place to hide in

128
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,939
some bushes or some crap you know as you

129
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:32,038
were you know just the pure innocence of

130
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,259
of that introduction moment and

131
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,300
everything it's it's great Rider I I

132
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,520
love the story and I think we all

133
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,020
identify with that oh yeah that's very

134
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,219
familiar going with your friends and

135
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,599
everybody waiting to see who's gonna

136
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,139
smoke it first and who's gonna have the

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,639
first reaction yeah yeah and of course I

138
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,800
guess that first time around the

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,259
campfire did you actually smoke with

140
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,020
those older dudes and not experience not

141
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,660
get high or was it you watch them do it

142
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,939
and thought Oh this is okay maybe I'll

143
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,580
someday later you tried it

144
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,918
well actually that was a this is a ghost

145
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,198
story we we were camping up in the

146
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,740
mountains in Colorado in between Vail

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,259
and uh Steamboat Springs and we were we

148
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,699
were probably at 12 000 feet way up on

149
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,780
top of this mountain

150
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,939
and uh I I I I just watched them smoke a

151
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,818
little bit of it but in the morning my

152
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,860
cousin who was a little bit older than I

153
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,660
uh told me oh man there were ghosts last

154
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,819
night but didn't you hear all the horses

155
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,560
and all the Indians and everything and I

156
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,319
I looked I was like no man I didn't

157
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,180
remember any of that wow but apparently

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,939
they woke up in the middle of the night

159
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,720
hearing horses stampeding through the

160
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,699
little uh Valley we were in and it just

161
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,220
got louder and louder and louder and no

162
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,900
nothing appeared and it scared the [ __ ]

163
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,419
out all these guys

164
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,758
but uh I didn't hear any of it I only

165
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,560
heard the story and and they said man I

166
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,919
I do remember them saying man that

you couldn't hear

170
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,719
story that they used to tell and I was

171
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,459
there when it happened but I I certainly

172
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,220
didn't hear any horses or anything like

173
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,620
that but I do remember the the smell of

174
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,039
the weed was really really sweet

175
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,019

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,020

182
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:35,399
Colombian weed and the country of

183
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,258

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,060
that

194
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,859
um that Colombian weed you were saying

195
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,598
what what year was this yes the first

196
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,220
time you smoked you didn't well let me

197
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,379
tell you about the first time and I I

198
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,280
left out an important character and that

199
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:11,098
was Becky Becky was a 16 year old this

200
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,198
was the last day of school and she when

201
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:17,098
she found out I had the marijuana when I

202
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,098
had the two joints uh her her

203
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:22,680
her disposition to me changed and she

204
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:25,860
became very attentive and I was I I

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,699
suddenly realized that man this weed

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,519
really gets her excited you know

207
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,759
so we we walked down towards the lake

208
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,639
with a little group of

209
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:40,740
smaller children following us and uh as

210
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,958
we got to a certain place we lit up the

211
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,959
joint and when I I noticed when we lit

212
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,838
the joint all the little kids were gone

213
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,879
but I I gave it to her she took a couple

214
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,980
big hits and she grabbed my arm and said

215
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,860
hey come here and she put the joint in

216
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:00,720
her mouth you know for a shotgun yeah

217
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,480
and gave me a big shotgun kiss yeah and

218
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,399
I felt it man I mean I that [ __ ] that

219
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,740
was the first hit of that joint but man

220
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,320
I felt it right away

221
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,778
and we smoke the rest of that joint and

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,320
we walked down to the I was high as hell

223
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:19,080
everything was just incredibly it was

224
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,660
afternoon the sun was out birds were out

225
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,180
we walked to this really secluded part

226
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,278
of the lake and she just took her

227
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,099
clothes off and went into the water

228
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,740
and I was as women tend to do around all

229
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,778
of us and I I didn't even know I didn't

230
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,299
I should have jumped on that but I

231
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:38,039
didn't I was just too much in wow she

232
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,439
said come on in so I went into my

233
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,019
clothes

234
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,600
but it was an excellent experience that

235
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,240
shotgun that shotgun kiss is like was

236
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,820
like the sexiest thing

237
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,440
yeah right combining your two favorite

238
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,480
things in the world

239
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,160
right up it was a good way to get a girl

240
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,320
to kiss you too you know oh yeah well

241
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,539
and she did it it was even better you

242
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,839
know yeah but uh all right so then she

243
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:09,299
goes she's in the water

244
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,100
but I never told her I had another joint

245
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,559
and I kept that other one I went back

246
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,360
home and I ate and I was with my parents

247
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,119
and everything and I thought man I still

248
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,060
have a whole another joint of that

249
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,519
so I turned on my best friend he's like

250
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:27,899
my friend of 40 years

251
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,639
50 now and uh after that we started uh

252
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,799
trying to grow it

253
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,379
you know from all the seeds and we never

254
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,199
really got any plants but but that

255
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,838
started the the my quest where I would

256
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,240
divide by every week I was working then

257
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,000
I was 13 but I had a job

258
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,879
and every week when I got paid I'd go to

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,339
the Yamaha dealership and uh the

260
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,100
mechanic would sell me a nice lid of

261
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,320
Mexican you know nice

262
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,899
it was a great summer

263
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,360
yeah yeah we we rode dirt bikes all

264
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,278
summer down by this Lake and uh we just

265
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,320
get high I met some other guys that got

266
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,379
me high down there with some really good

267
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,540
like tie stick wow

268
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,700
but you know I already knew there was

269
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,219
really good weed around uh even though

270
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,459
all I could buy was you know [ __ ] weed

271
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,579
but we were reading High Times yeah and

272
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,559
the high times but to me High Times was

273
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,778
like a penthouse you know it's like I

274
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,719
knew it existed but it wasn't what I was

275
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:29,220
getting very much yeah yeah they were

276
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,879
yeah

277
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,879
yeah

278
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,159
go ahead

279
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,479
oh I was just I was just thinking you

280
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,120
know that um

281
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,039
that's my exact same experience I I had

282
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,078
a very good friend

283
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,360
um you know through high school as I was

284
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,239
doing all this stuff at you know side by

285
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,100
side we were we were we were real parent

286
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,019
sounds like you had that that same

287
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,180
experience I'm sure that's pretty common

288
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,159
you know I think it's just so refreshing

289
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,500
to get people to come on now who have

290
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:03,719
been you know chasing this this thing

291
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:08,278
for so long and who who admit when they

292
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:12,600
weren't a huge OG OG baller and when

293
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,639
things went wrong and how it was it they

294
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,120
didn't start off you know with a hundred

295
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,278
acres of you know of of stuff they they

296
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,139
started off with three plants in a

297
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,639
shadow and

298
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,399
um

299
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,278
you know and it changed everything right

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,740
so I think I think you

301
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,838
um you know that Honesty makes it just

302
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,700
so refreshing compared to I mean look

303
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,339
there are people out there who have done

304
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,560
big big big stuff and I respect them I

305
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,360
know it's real love hearing the stories

306
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,979
but there's also people out there

307
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,259
fronting that they're they're more than

308
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,200
and were more than what they really were

309
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:52,078
and I just like I like the honesty red I

310
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,079
guess so uh please continue

311
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,699
the one check and what happened was uh

312
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,559
the other side

313
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,120
I had a parent's house we weren't there

314
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,799
my parents weren't there and

315
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,019
I tried to get them to come in to listen

316
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,639
to some music and they said nah it

317
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:10,320
looked a little dangerous in the house

318
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,959
and but the Colombian girl Uchi Uchi she

319
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
said yeah I'll go in within one thing

320
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,278
led to another and I started seeing her

321
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,399
by herself

322
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,399
and uh one night I bought some really

323
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,700
good Lumbo Man I mean this was a good 50

324
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,360
45 dollar lid of Lumbo and I thought it

325
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,459
was just really really good yeah and I

326
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,620
uh was with her and I said look you have

327
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,919
to try this you have to try this it's

328
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,480
from your country man yeah and uh

329
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,039
believe it or not she took a hit of it

330
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,778
and and threw it down and we were

331
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,338
outside she threw it on the ground and I

332
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,659
was like hey whoa that's my job yeah

333
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,480
what

334
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,819
but between her lovely cleavage she

335
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,879
pulled out a joint man and she said now

336
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,459
this is good weed and she lit that [ __ ]

337
00:13:53,879 --> 00:14:00,240
up and that's when I really had some

338
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:03,479
good good connoisseur Colombian

339
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,278
but also fell in love with her you know

340
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,700
I mean it was kind of a combination

341
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,860
thing there yeah I bet

342
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,680
oh yeah then I I had to know more about

343
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,720
Colombia I I but she left she was there

344
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,399
for three weeks and went back to

345
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,500
Columbia and never heard from her again

346
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,220
oh man

347
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,700
that is the best Colombian love story

348
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,370
ever right

349
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,370
[Laughter]

350
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,339
red red red that is the best Colombian

351
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:40,198
love story ever oh my gosh so awesome

352
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:43,620
wow wow oh it goes

353
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,599
what happened after that yeah we didn't

354
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,839
get all of the American part of this

355
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,540
story yet did we no this was the the

356
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,360
first time I got high and I don't know

357
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:57,419
why but I'd smoked it before I mean I'd

358
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,459
smoked weed before yeah yeah but I think

359
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,139
that's common for a lot of us like the

360
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,759
first time we do we smoke we don't quite

361
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,799
know what to or what we're gonna

362
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,838
experience we don't know how much to

363
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,879
smoke we don't really maybe sometimes

364
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,440
don't know how how to inhale correctly

365
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,539
at that point depending on if we smoke

366
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,279
cigarettes or Not by that age and I

367
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,778
think it's our brain just doesn't know

368
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,000
how to process it so we don't understand

369
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:19,439
the high so like it takes three or four

370
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,198
times to where you're like ah this is

371
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,320
comfortable you know yeah then you you

372
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,059
know what to expect yeah exactly that's

373
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,480
great you know when the boys in the lab

374
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:33,000
coach start talking about

375
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,399
cannabinoid receptors you know yeah you

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,458
know that from the end the

377
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,559
endocannabinoid system you think about

378
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:43,799
the first time you flood those things

379
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,958
with an external cannabinoid it's really

380
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,759
cool because you know may who knows

381
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,619
maybe maybe like the first time you do

382
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,519
that it's like whoa you know your

383
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,519
cannabinoids are all yeah personalizing

384
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,560
them right there's you know whoa you

385
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,000
know they're really reacting to this

386
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,278
flood of cannabinoids they don't know

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
what to do with it maybe they shut down

388
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:07,500
yeah the first time right maybe or block

389
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,179
it or something I don't know I'm just

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,799
throwing this [ __ ] out there man that

391
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,159
stuff we were smoking had been through

392
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,659
hell before it got to us so so have you

393
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,939
uh Ryder have you heard of something

394
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:21,078
called CHS out there

395
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,060
um can that I think it's cannabinoid

396
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:27,239
hyperemesis syndrome

397
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,319
um no it's fairly new and

398
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,220
um it's something that they've been

399
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,180
pushing like so I I've both my brother

400
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:38,040
uh or and my cousin have gone to the ER

401
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:42,000
recently with some cyclic vomiting kind

402
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,980
of like I have too like and they the

403
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,278
nurses keep pushing this idea that it's

404
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,139
from something called CHS cannabinoid

405
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,179
hyperemesis syndrome so it's something

406
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,980
and I started doing research into it and

407
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,319
one of my good friends is an ER doctor

408
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,120
and he's a he's a smoker too so he's

409
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,879
been really researching this because he

410
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,980
started having similar symptoms and from

411
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,360
what they can tell early on the research

412
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,779
thought they thought maybe it's from

413
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,759
crops sprayed with neem oil yeah but

414
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,678
they're not sure if that really is the

415
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,480
case they're not sure if it's from you

416
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,400
know heavy use of extracts since a lot

417
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,259
of people randomly use extracts with

418
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,919
flour and and it's just too much for our

419
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:23,039
systems but whatever it is it's inducing

420
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,280
um a cyclical vomiting in people just

421
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,500
like day after day after day of endless

422
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,418
puking in people but they just don't

423
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,980
know why and they call it cannabinoid

424
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,320
hyperemesis syndrome but realistically

425
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,440
it could be related to terpenes it could

426
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,200
be related to an unknown or an untested

427
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,419
for cannabinoid you know not THC but it

428
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,220
could be you know God knows what else

429
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,620
but yeah it's an interesting one that's

430
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,100
going to be popping up more and more

431
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,319
yeah maybe the presence of uh of foreign

432
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:55,139
stuff and concentrates I mean none of

433
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:58,798
this really happened until there was a a

434
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,580
legal Market yeah

435
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:04,679
um there's a lot of causation you know

436
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,619
um correlation causation type stuff yeah

437
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,380
stuff yeah probably going on but you

438
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,178
know I I did you uh talk to any of your

439
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,280
family about the

440
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,038
at Theory I talked with you about about

441
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,940
the effects of breathing super heated

442
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,140
[ __ ] from uh butane torches no

443
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,860
um so

444
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,280
neither of them do that but they they

445
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,740
both are very heavily uh like Vape

446
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,119
cartridge users

447
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,400
like the carts like the isolate cart

448
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,619
[ __ ] you know remember the guy that that

449
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,440
used to measure that used to measure

450
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:45,899
this Mystery Oil and all the available

451
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,100
butane on the market yes that guy yeah

452
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,759
um yeah

453
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:52,319
ah who knows man yeah I did I get

454
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,900
frustrated with science these days

455
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,359
because they all have these other

456
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,179
agendas you know it's just like where's

457
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,058
them coming from well then I moved to

458
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,059
Florida because my father my stepmother

459
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:09,058
lived in in West Palm Beach and uh

460
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:11,160
that's where I I had that Dan the

461
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,918
painter Man story uh that's where the

462
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,320
guy he was a drug dealer lived right

463
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,960
upstairs and he was getting all these

464
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,939
fantastic Imports coming through South

465
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,579
uh Florida at the time

466
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,740
and in fact that's when I first saw the

467
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,500
the first indica

468
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,960
oh wow what year

469
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,440
uh that was that was actually the spring

470
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,200
of 1980. oh nice perfect

471
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,660
and I didn't know it was Indica uh as a

472
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,179
matter of fact uh I I only read about

473
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,500
indica and High Times I I really didn't

474
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,259
know what it was

475
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,798
and I did grow plants I started growing

476
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,538
plants in Texas in the late 70s but I

477
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,298
didn't know how to do it

478
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:56,220
I didn't know how to flower them or

479
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:57,960
or anything like that is that why you

480
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,579
moved to Columbia because they just do

481
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,500
you can't mess it up woman and uh

482
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:07,678
in

483
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:11,000
2002 uh February January 112 met her

484
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,038
online you know I met her online

485
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,538
I thought man I wanna I wanna find a

486
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,058
woman you know I want to meet a woman

487
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,640
and I thought where where should I find

488
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:22,740
where what what woman would I want so I

489
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,340
started looking in Colombia

490
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:30,419
uh oh okay when I say looking there was

491
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:34,079
a a program called I see her

492
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:36,720
what was it icq icq yeah yeah yeah yeah

493

582
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,798
so I we had changed hotels to the Hilton

583
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,620
for some reason I got a really good rate

584
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:43,579
on this beautiful incredible room

585
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:46,379
overlooking the Lagoon and uh Cartagena

586
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:48,298
and I wanted to roll that [ __ ] up first

587
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,400
thing I did was I went out on the

588
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:52,798
balcony and got my papers and started

589
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
breaking it down and I looked around and

590
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,599
I thought where the where the hell is

591
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,940
she at and she went in the bathroom and

592
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,558
locked the door

593
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,380
and I was like don't worry don't worry

594
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,558
you know and I I lift that up and I got

595
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,799
high as hell and I knocked on the door

596
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,899
and I was like hey hey and uh she said

597
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,700
what she opened up the door and I'm

598
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,820
standing there with an erection from

599
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,440
hell man I mean

600
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:22,678
this does this to you

601
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,080
but it was a beautiful romantic

602
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,679
experience with the Colombian again

603
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,678
again

604
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,940
she locked the door was she so was she

605
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,559
scared of like the consequences of

606
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,880
someone might smell it and the cops

607
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,859
coming or

608
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,919
no she was afraid it was going to make

609
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:43,079
me go crazy because they they don't

610
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,419
think of drugs like we do they they

611
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,339
really don't this is a narco State and

612
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,440
the normal people the regular people

613
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:52,079
don't they don't [ __ ] with drugs they

614
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,840
just don't do it yeah yeah no alcoholics

615
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,960
they you know you like drenching come

616
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:03,139
here they drink more than Germans yeah

617
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:06,259
you know we have 22 holidays a year 22.

618
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:10,259
we have five in the United States yeah

619
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:13,859
so they're always is always a festival a

620
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:17,000
party or a reason to get drunk yeah it

621
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:20,219
makes sense but don't smoke no weed

622
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,538
Narco states are weird man and and it

623
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,339
makes sense though because of the

624
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,798
propaganda that the U.S had pushed down

625
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:28,379
there so hard and and

626
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:30,599
well I've got a big taste of it here not

627
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,120
yeah for sure it's uh it's interesting

628
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,399
though because you know by the by the

629
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:39,298
80s I think most people

630
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,200
in the country kind of realized it was

631
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,200
not true

632
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,520
there are huge parts of the population

633
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,819
though who just bought it hook line and

634
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,619
sinker and uh you know they just bought

635
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,960
it and they passed it down to their

636
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:57,778
children they just repeated its myths

637
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,120
and it's uh very powerful I mean that

638
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,740
much she must she was scared right she

639
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,219
was legitimately scared you were gonna

640
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,099
come back and be like the crazy guy from

641
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,159
playing the piano and Reefer Madness you

642
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:14,339
know yeah

643
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,580
while we're while we're here in um in

644
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:21,359
like the the DEA propaganda territory

645
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:22,678
why don't we cover some of the uh Parts

646
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,319
about

647
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,480
the perceptions of Colombia and the

648
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,000
dangerous Parts like how dangerous it is

649
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,278
or isn't to go there and the perception

650
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,319
from America and that and your your

651
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,659
fears when you first went there what

652
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,399
were your concerns you know uh when I

653
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,278
was doing a lot of traveling in South

654
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,580
America in the 90s Colombia was the one

655
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:47,880
place I didn't go because it was so

656
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,558
sketchy then right now it seems like

657
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,080
very comfortable and nice and there's

658
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,839
all kinds of travel in and out

659
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,319
um but it was by far the most violent

660
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:00,658
and sketchy place you know in the 90s at

661
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,859
least actually in the 90s was Pablo

662
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,080
Escobar

663
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:06,418

there on business and stuff so you know

666
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,959
now it's like reversed I went to

667
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,119
Venezuela because uh Colombia was

668
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,340
trashed and now it's reversed like

669
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,739
nobody goes to Venezuela and Colombia is

670
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:22,740
like super nice and like beautiful and

671
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm sure it was then too it just was not

672
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,159
so accessible

673
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,960

682
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:49,139

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,759
and South America

689
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,340

691
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,240

692
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,500
nice like

693
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,419
well I mean you just like growing up in

694
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,679
a big city I just wanted to not look

695
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,100
like a mark

696
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,320
yeah that's what I do I blend in I mean

697
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,839
I I've worked here I've lived in the

698
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,839
worst Barrios in Bogota

699
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:37,079
so I mean this is the red light zone

700
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,658
where it's very cheap prostitutes really

701
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,460
a bad area yeah and I never had a

702
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,679
problem because I was just very

703
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,659
conscious of what was going on around me

704
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,700
and never had anything to steal yeah

705
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,700
yeah

706
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,159
the only thing I have that's a value is

707
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,319
weed and here weed doesn't have very

708
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,539
much value but to me it's worth more

709
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:01,278
than money sure

710
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:06,298
like I said the first my first love in

711
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:09,839
1977s was 78 or was it 79 with the first

712
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:12,298
Colombian girl that I met Uchi Brian uh

713
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,480

714
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:18,179
family uh

715
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,460
as in regards to security a lot of it's

716
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,380

777
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,840
chick that came up to us and said hey

778

782
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,200
Colombian that she she just gave us a

783

was green though real green Colombian

785
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,200
and the smell had the taste

786
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:34,319
but yeah Dan Dan got every kind of thing

787
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,340
he got the the Gainesville green I I

788
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,480
don't know if you guys ever heard of

789
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,579
that can you talk about that a little

790
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,740
bit like your early experience with the

791
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,599
smell maybe possibly describe the smell

792
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,339
and look of Gainesville green or what

793
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,099
you thought might be in it

794
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:50,699
yeah well Gainesville green reminded me

795
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:53,339
now of what I what I grow is oaxacan

796
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,640
it's very similar but it wasn't similar

797
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:58,558
to the oaxacan back then yeah it was

798
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,500
green and it was since a media and it

799
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,859
had a real painy

800
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,859
I don't know how it's real Pines real

801
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:11,398
nice high real real clear that's what I

802
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:13,559
like is clear Clarity yeah

803
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,199
which unfortunately most Colombians

804
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,719
weren't back then the the red was like a

805
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,939
really really dirty High kind of

806
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,138
but uh you know the Gainesville green

807
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:29,280
the Maui the Maui Wowie yeah yeah

808
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:31,500
Cayman came in a can of nuts oh wow

809
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,179
macadamia

810
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,519
there's some weed in there yeah I mean I

811
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,858
I read that they are heard that you know

812
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,300
like uh shipping it over in macadamia

813
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:44,480
nut cans was a big thing that's so wild

814
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,519
top opened it up in just an incredible

815
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,639
it makes sense for smell to hide the

816
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,800
smell everything smart it was teasing me

817
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,220
with it he'd start to let me smell it

yep

821
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,460
let's start talking about that that

822
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,200
um that Colombian weed you were saying

823
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,940
what what year was this yes the first

824
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,559
time you smoked you didn't well let me

825
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,659
tell you about the first time and I I

826
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:19,619
left out an important character and that

827
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:21,299
was Becky Becky was a 16 year old this

828
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,640
was the last day of school

829
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,760
and she when she found out I had the

830
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,440
marijuana when I had the two joints uh

831
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,500
her her

832
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,079
her disposition to me changed and she

833
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,139
became very attentive and I was I I

834
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,720
suddenly realized that man this weed

835
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:41,039
really gets her excited you know she's

836
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,858
really

837
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:47,039
so we we walked down towards the lake

838
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:50,279
with a little group of of uh smaller

839
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,380
children following us and uh as we got

840
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,420
to a certain place we lit up the joint

841
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,300
and when I I noticed when we lift the

842
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,180
joint all the little kids were gone

843
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,220
but I I gave it to her she took a couple

844
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:04,319
big hits and she grabbed my arm and said

845
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:07,139
hey come here and she put the joint in

846
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:12,059
her mouth you know for a shotgun yeah

847
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:14,819
and gave me a big shotgun kiss yeah and

848
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,739
I felt it man I mean I that [ __ ] that

849
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,140
was the first hit of that joint but man

850
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:21,539
I felt it right away

851
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:24,000
and we smoked the rest of that joint and

852
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:27,599
we walked down to the I was high as hell

853
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,420
everything was just incredibly it was

854
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,059
afternoon the sun was out birds were out

855
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,579
we walked to this really secluded part

856
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,559
of the lake and she just took her

857
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:40,500
clothes off and went into the water

858
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,739
and I was as women tend to do around all

859
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,739
of us

860
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,059
have jumped on that but I I didn't I was

861
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,780
just too much in wow and she said come

862
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,299
on in so I went into my clothes

863
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:56,640
but it was an accident

864
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,640
that shotgun that shotgun kiss is like

865
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,920
was like the sexiest thing

866
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:05,059
ever yeah right combining your two

867
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,059
favorite things in the world

868
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,060
all right so then she goes she's in the

869
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,639
water

870
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,380
but I never told her I had another joint

871
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,838
and I kept that other one I went back

872
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,640
home and I ate and I was with my parents

873
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,519
and everything and I thought man I still

874
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,460
have a whole another joint of that

875
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,858
so I turned on my best friend he's like

876
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:39,179
my friend of 40 years

877
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:40,980
50 now and uh after that we started uh

878
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,199
trying to grow it

879
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,838
you know from all the seeds and we never

880
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,598
really got any plants but but that

881
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,239
started the the my quest where I would

882
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,579
divide by every week I was working then

883
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,459
I was 13 but I had a job

884
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:59,280
and every week when I got paid I'd go to

885
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,800
the Yamaha dealership and uh the

886
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,380
mechanic would sell me a nice lid of

887
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,720
Mexican you know nice

888
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,000
it was a great summer

889
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,578
yeah yeah we we rode dirt bikes all

890
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,619
summer down by this Lake and uh we just

891
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,660
get high I met some other guys that got

892
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,720
me high down there with some really good

893
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:21,059
like tie stick wow

894
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,098
but you know I already knew there was

895
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,619
really good weed around uh even though

896
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:28,800
all I could buy was you know [ __ ] weed

897
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,980
but we were reading High Times yeah and

898
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,839
the high times but to me High Times was

899
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,179
like a penthouse you know it's like I

900
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:39,059
knew it existed but it wasn't what I was

901
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,618
getting very much yeah yeah they were

902
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:42,619
yeah

903
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,619
yeah

904
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,440
go ahead

905
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,760
oh I was just I was just thinking you

906
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,519
know that um

907
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,380
that's my exact same experience I I had

908
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,480
a very good friend

909
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,760
um you know through high school as I was

910
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,579
doing all this stuff at you know side by

911
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,380
side we were we were we were real parent

912
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,300
sounds like you had that that same

913
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,460
experience I'm sure that's pretty common

914
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,440
you know I think it's just so refreshing

915
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,780
to get people to come on now who have

916
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,000
been you know chasing this this thing

917
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:19,560
for so long and who who admit when they

918
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,880
weren't a huge OG OG baller and when

919
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:25,920
things went wrong and how it was it they

920
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,460
didn't start off you know with a hundred

921
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,619
acres of you know of of stuff they they

922
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,920
started off with three plants in a

923
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,740
shadow and um

924
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,619
you know and it changed everything right

925
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:43,078
so I think I think you

926
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:45,180
um you know that Honesty makes it just

927
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:47,039
so refreshing compared to I mean look

928
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:49,679
there are people out there who have done

929
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,900
big big big stuff and I respect them I

930
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,699
know it's real love hearing the stories

931
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,320
but there's also people out there

932
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,598
fronting that they're they're more than

933
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,359
and were more than what they really were

934
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,720
and I just like I like the honesty right

935
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:06,059
I guess so uh please continue yeah we

936
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:09,179
didn't get all of the American part of

937
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:12,059
this story yet did we now this was the

938
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:14,759
the first time I got high and I don't

939
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:17,940
know why but I'd smoked it before I mean

940
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,440
I'd smoked weed before yeah yeah but I

941
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,480
think that's common for a lot of us like

942
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,338
the first time we do we smoke we don't

943
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,380
quite know what to or what we're gonna

944
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:27,480
experience we don't know how much to

945
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,460
smoke we don't really maybe sometimes

946
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,019
don't know how how to inhale correctly

947
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,179
at that point depending on if we smoke

948
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:34,858
cigarettes or Not by that age and I

949
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,358
think it's our brain just doesn't know

950
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,578
how to process it so we don't understand

951
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,019
the high so like it takes three or four

952
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,780
times to where you're like ah this is

953
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:45,960
comfortable you know yeah then you you

954
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,700
know what to expect yeah exactly that's

955
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,059
great you know when the boys in the lab

956
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:53,639
coach start talking about

957
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:55,039
cannabinoid receptors you know yeah you

958
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:57,299
know that from the end the

959
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,358
endocannabinoid system and

960
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,880
um you think about the first time you

961
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,699
flood those things with an external

962
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,680
cannabinoid it's really cool because you

963
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:09,659
know may who knows maybe maybe like the

964
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,940
first time you do that it's like whoa

965
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:13,219
you know here Canada noids are all

966
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,539
yeah

967
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:17,639
personalizing them right there's you

968
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,679
know whoa you know they're they're

969
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,059
really reacting to this flood of

970
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,699
cannabinoids they don't know what to do

971
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,759
with it maybe they they shut down yeah

972
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:28,078
the first time right maybe or block it

973
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,760
or something I don't know I'm just

974
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,440
throwing this [ __ ] out there man that

975
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,740
stuff we were smoking had been through

976
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,300
hell before it got to us so so have you

977
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:38,578
uh Ryder have you heard of something

978
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,720
called CHS out there

979
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:44,640
um can that I think it's cannabinoid

980
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,819
hyperemesis syndrome

981
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,900
um no it's fairly new and

982
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,800
um it's something that they've been

983
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:56,760
pushing like so I I've both my brother

984
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,619
uh or and my cousin have gone to the ER

985
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,579
recently with some cyclic vomiting kind

986
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,559
of like I have too like and they the

987
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:07,859
nurses keep pushing this idea that it's

988
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,719
from something called CHS cannabinoid

989
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,759
hypermesis syndrome so it's something

990
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:13,559
and I started doing research into it and

991
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,900
one of my good friends is an ER doctor

992
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,699
and he's a he's a smoker too so he's

993
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,460
been really researching this because he

994
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:22,559
started having similar symptoms and from

995
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,940
what they can tell early on the research

996
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,358
thought they thought maybe it's from

997
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,338
crops sprayed with neem oil yeah but

998
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,259
they're not sure if that really is the

999
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:33,059
case they're not sure if it's from you

1000
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,980
know heavy use of extracts since a lot

1001
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:36,838
of people randomly use extracts with

1002
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,500
flour and and it's just too much for our

1003
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:43,619
systems but whatever it is it's inducing

1004
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,858
um a cyclical vomiting in people just

1005
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:49,079
like day after day after day of endless

1006
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:51,000
puking in people but they just don't

1007
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,619
know why and they call it cannabinoid

1008
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,960
hyperemesis syndrome but realistically

1009
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,019
it could be related to terpenes it could

1010
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,780
be related to an unknown or an untested

1011
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:03,000
for cannabinoid you know not THC but it

1012
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,800
could be you know God knows what else

1013
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,199
but yeah it's an interesting one that's

1014
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,680
going to be popping up more and more

1015
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,899
yeah maybe the presence of uh of foreign

1016
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:15,719
stuff and concentrates I mean none of

1017
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,440
this really happened until there was a a

1018
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:23,219
legal Market yeah

1019
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,260
um there's a lot of causation you know

1020
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:28,199
um correlation causation type stuff yeah

1021
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,960
stuff yeah probably going on but you

1022
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:32,759
know I I did you uh talk to any of your

1023
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,800
family about the

1024
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,339
at Theory I talked with you about about

1025
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,519
the effects of breathing superheated

1026
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:42,779
[ __ ] from uh butane torches no

1027
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,500
um so

1028
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,660
neither of them do that but they they

1029
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,380
both are very heavily

1030
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:53,759
um like Vape cartridge users

1031
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,280
like the carts like the isolate cart

1032
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,920
[ __ ] you know remember the guy that used

1033
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,920
to measure that used to measure this

1034
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,200
Mystery Oil and all the available butane

1035
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,539
on the market yes

1036
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,679
that guy yeah

1037
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:11,338
um yeah

1038
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,960
ah who knows man yeah I did I get

1039
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:15,480
frustrated with science these days

1040
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,059
because they all have these other

1041
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,440
agendas you know it's just like where's

1042
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:21,000
the money coming from since you're

1043
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,900
familiar with all the Mexicans and

1044
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,059
everything do you when you uh that Maui

1045
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,760
um the can of Maui did it did it remind

1046
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:33,539
you were there any Mexican traits to the

1047
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,480
any any similarity at all uh no I never

1048
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:41,159
had cannabis like that before or since

1049
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,079
it had a real flowery you could feel the

1050
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,559
islands in it you could feel that

1051
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,900
tropical sunshine when it hit it I

1052
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,880
didn't get very much he he I couldn't

1053
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,559
buy it it was too expensive but I would

1054
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,480
just kind of hang around when other

1055
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,659
people would buy it so I could taste it

1056
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,280
yeah right but uh yeah that and there

1057
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:01,199
was there was other ones that was right

1058
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,079
about when we started seeing indicun

1059
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,838
everybody was really impressed oh it

1060
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:11,160
tastes like black hash and yeah it was a

1061
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:13,199
real narcotic hi yep but uh all I could

1062
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:16,078
really afford was the Mexicans now there

1063
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,419
were good Mexicans but most of them were

1064
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,480
I don't know why they imported it really

1065
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:25,019
I yeah it was a transition period you

1066
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,000
know while markets were shaken out

1067
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:29,460
um but you know that Colombo that we

1068
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,440
used to get imported hell man half of

1069
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,119
that stuff was seeds is so I was

1070
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,920
thinking about what we used to do with

1071
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,619
that stuff you know people would just

1072
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,260
throw handfuls of that fresh Colombian

1073
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:44,220
seed out in their yard and just have big

1074
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,079
off the porch yeah yeah I mean it seemed

1075
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:48,719
like half the weight that got imported

1076
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,180
was seed and how tragic it was that we

1077
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,159
just you know

1078
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:54,118
yeah that's interesting what you just

1079
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:55,618
said about

1080
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,140
um you know you were talking about how

1081
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,240
uplifting and clear the Awaken was and

1082
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:02,279
and and that you know the way you said

1083
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,199
it that you know you know the Colombian

1084
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,839
just wasn't like that it was

1085
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:08,879
you know people don't realize that yeah

1086
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:11,219
it was uh it was uh you know it was

1087
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,440
groggy was the way it felt a lot of

1088
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:15,959
times is that a good word for it yeah

1089
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,900
but some of the real high quality the

1090
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,780
golds were spiritual man and some of the

1091
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,818
red butt was really really good but

1092
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,819
dirty a little dirty at the end

1093
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:32,460
and if all you ever smoked was the was

1094
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:35,460
the the low end stuff you wouldn't

1095
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,019
recognize you know if it that it had

1096
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,300
some of that same stuff that the

1097
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,239
high-end had in it but it was just kind

1098
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,000
of buried under a layer of just you know

1099
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:48,719
bad handling and and you know it's

1100
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,480
probably harsh yeah yeah it was yeah it

1101
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,000
was just crap you know but it had it was

1102
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,980
still there but you had it's to even

1103
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,858
recognize that you had to have had the

1104
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,619
good stuff at some point say Oh that's

1105
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:04,559
oh it's in there you know anyway sorry

1106
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:08,280
I'm sidetracking no that's that's fine I

1107
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:11,119
remember uh uh right when uh I came this

1108
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,640
is 1980 uh I joined the military

1109
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:18,059
eventually but before that I I went I

1110
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:20,578
went back to Texas and I I my bro my

1111
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:23,358
cousin had this friend named Jay that

1112
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:26,160
was kind of a jock kind of a sports guy

1113
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:29,279
and who needed somebody to ride with him

1114
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:32,399
from Dallas to uh Houston to pick up

1115
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,760
some uh Panama Red he said it was

1116
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,619
supposed to be real Panama Red and of

1117
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,079
course I jumped on it man I wanted to

1118
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,838
ride with him and and we shot right down

1119
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,000
to Baytown and and I'm remember he went

1120
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:48,239
into this real uh

1121
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,599
real rough barn and Tugboat and it's

1122
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:54,239
like a biker bar man and people getting

1123
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,519
shot in there and everything but well he

1124
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,519
bought the pound and we we cruised on

1125
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:01,318
back to Dallas and uh like I said I

1126
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,539
don't know if it was really Panama Red

1127
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:06,420
it seemed to me like it was just real

1128
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:09,420
good Colombian red

1129
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,639
but he was selling it back then that he

1130
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,980
was selling that for a hundred uh an

1131
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,980
ounce you know it seems like the red

1132
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,780
maybe the red was all biker controlled

1133
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,139
or something

1134
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,900
I mean I I don't know

1135
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:30,059
I got more stories my my older brother

1136
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,880
was a wholesale dealer in 78 and he was

1137
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:34,679
bringing in

1138
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,318
truckloads of the Mexican [ __ ] weed you

1139
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,419
know the brick stuff but he also had a

1140
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:43,079
private stash and this is where I first

1141
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:45,000
saw California since Amelia uh and I saw

1142
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,519
a really good gold really good

1143
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,480
Colombians this was the top of the line

1144
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,579
he could get and uh I remember one time

1145
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,500
I asked him I said man which is what is

1146
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,800
this sense of age of what is this stuff

1147
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,420
and he said it's it's primo and he said

1148
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,640
but this is better and he had some

1149
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,139
Colombian red butt and this stuff would

1150
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,960
make you feel

1151
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:09,559
I can't describe it it just may fix

1152
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,980
you've healed your body healed your mind

1153
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:16,199
and it was really clean really clean uh

1154
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,539
you know secondary and everything

1155
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:21,779
of course I also found out about cocaine

1156
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:24,838
from him too that was also really clean

1157
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,000
really pure yeah well he didn't know

1158
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:28,559
about it uh one morning I got up for

1159
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,358
school and I opened up the refrigerator

1160
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,659
and all these little envelopes fall

1161
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:35,519
under the floor

1162
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:38,219
what is this man and I poured one out we

1163
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,259
had a big glass kitchen table and I

1164
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:41,939
poured it on the table and I said what

1165
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,839
is this next thing you know I go to

1166
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,139
school

1167
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,420
and my friend this girl that I wasn't

1168
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:51,118
romantic with but I guess she thought

1169
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,780
that she saw that she said we're not

1170

going to school today come on

1171
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:59,040
we sniff it all day but she knew what to

1172
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,940
do with it huh

1173
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,940
unfortunately

1174
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,660
or

1175
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:11,338
uh the guy that he was running around

1176
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:13,680
with uh new and undercover cop

1177
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:14,818
and they were going to rob him my

1178
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,618
brother didn't know it my brother

1179
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:20,279
thought he was going to really make a

1180
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:23,039
sale and when they went to meet the cop

1181
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,800
uh the the friend my brother pulled out

1182
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:28,259
a pistol and killed him oh my God and

1183
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,300
the woods were all wired with police and

1184
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:33,540
I didn't see my brother for about five

1185
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,818
years after that wow except for my

1186
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:38,219
brother who was he he was uh like a rock

1187
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:40,440
star he thought he was like a rock star

1188
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:44,519
and yeah he

1189
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:47,880
he would say I'm sorry 82 82 was what

1190
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:51,358
yeah yeah well see I was in Europe right

1191
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,500
when uh the last of the great uh import

1192
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:58,199
hash you know the afghanis the patches

1193
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:01,920
uh Lebanese we used to get red Lebanese

1194
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:04,318
that was like gum like big red gum it

1195
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,200
was soft and you could bend it

1196
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:10,619
it was just we called it choking red it

1197
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:12,838
would light your lungs up yeah the name

1198
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,338
there was rumors it was mixed with gum

1199
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,159
arabic

1200
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:18,599
oh interesting yeah interesting yeah

1201
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:20,940
that would let your lungs up wouldn't it

1202
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,519
it was real soft

1203
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,980
yeah it could well but it could also get

1204
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,539
hard as a rock too I mean if you got it

1205
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,119
soft and you were getting good stuff

1206
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:31,800
everything we got of that Lebanese and

1207
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,500
that was pretty much all that was around

1208
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,660
where we were it was hard as a rock and

1209
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,059
it barely got you high and it was so it

1210
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:42,598
might have had CBD in it I mean the

1211
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:46,619
black but no no but Lebanese red it was

1212
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,180
like golden red my experience is that

1213
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:52,260
um or from everything I've been able to

1214
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:56,279
gather is that like Europe got the far

1215
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:59,220
better hash Canada got some Sometimes

1216
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,800
some relatively decent hash and the

1217
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:04,618
United States and the United States got

1218
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,960
the got the [ __ ] that stuck to your shoe

1219
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,940
yeah they got the C grade and the D

1220
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,920
grade everything that they couldn't sell

1221
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,480
in Canada and Europe they were like

1222
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,280
we'll send to America because they'll

1223
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,500
take anything

1224
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,300
um so maybe you could talk about that

1225
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,619
for a second so you were in when you

1226
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,200
were in Europe when you were stationed

1227
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:24,119
in Europe you got to experience a bunch

1228
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:27,960
of of hashish

1229
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:31,079
oh yes uh I was stationed in a infantry

1230
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:34,019
battalion in baumholder that was West

1231
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,700
Germany then and uh I mean we were

1232
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:37,980
always out in the field I was in the

1233
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:41,159
Infantry so we were always camping out

1234
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,740
and all this [ __ ] but uh we would get uh

1235
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:47,460
what they call a plate a plate was about

1236
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:50,519
200 and it was a hundred grams

1237
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,619
and or we get a piece and a peace would

1238
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:55,079
be twenty dollars but it could be one

1239
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,240
gram or three grams

1240
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,339
and uh this was all in the barracks you

1241
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:02,338
know this is all with our service guys

1242
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:05,578
no Germans or anything no you're no

1243
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:08,519
urine tests for cannabis back then right

1244
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,660
pardon me no urine tests for cannabis

1245
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,300
back then

1246
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,338
no but that's when they started and

1247
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,440
that's when you know I

1248
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:19,460
I found out then that the military

1249
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,679
frowned on this Behavior

1250
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:26,480
had you told me was that not right it

1251
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,480
was did I do something wrong

1252
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,819
and it was like because nobody's seen

1253
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,118
weed there none of the Germans nobody

1254
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:37,079
had weed we were selling it for 25 a

1255
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:40,200
joint

1256
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,119
this guy was selling joints for 25 and I

1257
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:43,500
was buying a hundred dollars man I was

1258
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,619

1262
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:56,578

1263
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:57,900
was so different it didn't smell like

1264
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:00,119
hash

1265
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:03,500

it's legal awesome I'm gonna send you

1284
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:46,679
some you're stockpiling it like a

1285
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:48,598
prepper down there huh I mean

1286
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,940
one thing you know when we had our

1287
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:53,579
little gathering recently when we had a

1288
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,519
little gathering recently or whatever uh

1289
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:58,500
one of the clear things that comes up is

1290
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:01,440
you can get people that have that have

1291
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,019
been in cannabis their whole life

1292
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
um and describing taste and Aroma is

1293
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:09,300
almost everyone's weak point

1294
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,160
you know you're like what does it taste

1295
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,119
like what does it smell like and to you

1296
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:17,338
you could be like oh this reminds me of

1297
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,619
1978 or this smells clearly like what I

1298
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:21,960
remember but if you try to piece

1299
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,660
together what that smell is the language

1300
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,579
is insufficient yeah

1301
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:30,420
there's a special language for that

1302
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:32,280
stuff and you know it's um and some of

1303
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,318
it is just experiential you know like

1304
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,599
when you talk about baby poo I think you

1305
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,599
were saying the other day not so about

1306
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:41,400
the smell of baby poo yeah people think

1307
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,740
that this is some you know some other

1308
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,539
way to say skunk or they're imagining

1309
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:47,818
something that they see on a toilet

1310
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:50,400
paper after they do their business but

1311
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:52,139
that's not it man it's a whole it's a if

1312
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,660
you've never had a kid or been around

1313
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:56,818
little babies you know you don't you

1314
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:59,338
you'll never smell that smell anywhere

1315
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:02,699
yeah that is no frame of reference to me

1316
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:05,578
yeah yeah I had three kids in four years

1317
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:08,039
so the smell of young kid baby poo is is

1318
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:10,200
uh pretty pretty you know that was that

1319
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,239
was daily life for quite some time and

1320
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,879
it triggers and it triggers emotional

1321
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,979
you know memory response too you know

1322
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,200
that that smell it's all connected to

1323
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:23,219
the whole thing like I'm a Daddy you

1324
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,899
know but um yeah so I mean red we can do

1325
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,239
better than that right I mean it's so

1326
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:30,240
you're talking about gold Sandalwood is

1327
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:32,459
is uh is you know one of those Woody

1328
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:37,139
smells

1329
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:41,179
okay the the the really blonde gold to

1330
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:44,818
me had a a sandalwood incense

1331
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,960
burnt almost caramel almost sweet but

1332
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,358
not sweet

1333
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,940
and uh it was really good it had a

1334
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:53,460
different flavor on the exhale that was

1335
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,619
that was kind of addictive I you'd want

1336
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,500
to taste it again and again

1337
00:56:55,619 --> 00:57:00,780
and the the ones like the purples they

1338
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,179
didn't have a fruity flavor or smell

1339
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,099
like you'd think looking at it but it

1340
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:08,818
would have more like uh I've been a

1341
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:13,619
woody but not Cedar more like just a

1342
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:16,920
a wood wood incense taste and the Reds

1343
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:18,000
were very Cedar tasting with a delicious

1344
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,818
uh

1345
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,420
I can't it's like a

1346
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:26,639
burnt malt almost

1347
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,639
you know very just

1348
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:28,639
um

1349
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:35,879
like a like a long wood

1350
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,020
all right we're cutting in and out again

1351
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,019

1352
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,460
sorry hey hey um so yeah you got laggy

1353
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,920
again and then I tried to talk so hey

1354
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,900
that burnt malt is that like a loamy

1355
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,480
kind of a peat

1356
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,358
but but let me tell you uh when I was

1357
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,019
growing up my in Texas my my uncle was

1358
00:57:54,358 --> 00:58:00,299
really wealthy and uh I had two cousins

1359
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:03,179
and one was a little bit older than I

1360
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:06,539

1367
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:23,039
don't mean with a lawnmower I mean with

1368

and uncle would leave early for work and

1375
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:43,559

1386
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:10,798
but I was sitting out there and I had my

1387
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,619
Marlboro Red and I was smoking it with

1388

my cousin the same age as me and my

1389
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:18,180
older cousin came out and said hey man

1391
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:23,039
a little bit of a baggie and I opened it

1392
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:24,179
up and I said what the [ __ ] is this it

1393
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,639

I mean it wasn't green at all there was

1395
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:32,039
no green or brown in it it was yellow it

1396
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:33,719

1398
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:39,959
flakes no it was strings chunks nugs

1399
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:42,420
what would it look like

1400
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,460
it well it didn't look real pretty but

1401
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,500
it was just a color of it and it's full

1402
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,539
of seeds just like the Mexican but it

1403
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,960
wasn't real hard compressed it was like

1404
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:53,338
flat buds so it was busted up but it had

1405
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,318
been pressed

1406
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:57,659
yeah it had been pressed and they I

1407
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:59,579
guess he had broken it up but and it was

1408
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:02,879
only about a gram and a half it wasn't

1409
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,440
very much cool and I told him I said I

1410
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,298
don't think there's a joint here and he

1411
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,099
said [ __ ] man he said he sat down

1412
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:11,280
and rolled that pin joint you guys know

1413
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:13,380
that word pin joint yeah man little tiny

1414
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,540
like in the Cheech and Chong movies

1415
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,400
that's a toothpick man no that's a joint

1416
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:20,159
yeah

1417
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,500
but he we sparked that up and let me

1418
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,779
tell you I got a little bit more uh uh

1419
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,579
some words more adjectives to describe

1420
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:30,059
the taste and smell

1421
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:33,480
but this had a cardboard almost like a

1422
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:36,720
cardboard Coca-Cola

1423
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,940
uh and it had a hash taste similar to

1424
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:43,618
the Lebanese blonde

1425
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:46,079
yeah oh interesting yeah and uh it was a

1426
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:47,940
really really different taste in the I

1427
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,400
mean the the Mexican we got had no

1428
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:55,619
terpenes it was like Hey it tastes like

1429
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:57,960
grass really grass that hashiness that's

1430
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,940
uh that hashiness is what I want to keep

1431
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,480
asking people if they think that there

1432
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:06,420
might be Indica in in Colombian gold you

1433
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:09,079
know Cinema or whatever because that it

1434
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:12,539
was very real that it was

1435
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:15,480
and it was Heavy it had a it had a more

1436
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:17,639
I'll go into that later because there's

1437
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,900
a something I'd like to talk about how

1438
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:22,920
the these uh heirlooms Colombians

1439
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,500
occurred and I believe that happened

1440
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,420
about 150 years ago they weren't

1441
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:30,719
indigenous

1442
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,400
but anyway so we we I took one hit off

1443
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,338
of that and this is where we get the

1444
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,519
expression expando because it got in

1445
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:41,818
your lungs and man you couldn't hold it

1446
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:44,519
in you cough it out cough it out

1447
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:47,400
and next thing I know I was higher than

1448
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,079
you could I have ever been in my life I

1449
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,500
mean my eyes

1450
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:54,660
everything would crashed and my uncle

1451
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,420
called and said we had to go out and cut

1452
01:01:54,659 --> 01:02:00,139
this pasture and I said man I I can't do

1453
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,139
it I'm too funny

1454
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:05,400
you have to go work now

1455
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:07,619
my cousin was like come on smoke some

1456
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,940
more you'll be all right power through

1457
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:11,519
yeah

1458
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:13,619
but the thing is my uncle took us out in

1459
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,079
the middle of nowhere with a tractor on

1460
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:18,240
the trailer and and he gave us a cooler

1461
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,519
and I thought there'd be you know

1462
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,459
Gatorade or something like that but it

1463
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:25,500
was of course Coors beer it was before

1464
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,019
cell phones so if anything happened you

1465
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:31,099
were walking back yeah yeah if you cut

1466
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:31,099
your hand off or something

1467
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:38,400
we drank all that beer and got so drunk

1468
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:41,699
man I mean just absolutely wasted but by

1469
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,240
four o'clock the sun was I mean it was a

1470
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:47,219
terrible hangover yeah my bad and we

1471
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,259
smoked the rest of that we didn't finish

1472
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:51,358
that little pin joint we smoked the

1473
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:55,160
other half of it at the end of the day

1474
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,159
and crashed me again

1475
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:02,760
my uncle gave us a little 38 caliber

1476
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,220
revolver in case there was a snake or

1477
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,900
something you know I remember smoking

1478
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:08,818
that joint and I was looking at my other

1479
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,119
cousin going you know how to dance boy

1480
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:14,039
oh no

1481
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,880
yeah give the kids a revolver yeah

1482
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:20,099
Kingpin from an early age right but but

1483
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,960
that was when I first had good good

1484
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:24,180
Colombian there was other Colombian

1485
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:28,139
before that that I tried but it wasn't

1486
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:30,000
like this this was really different and

1487
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:31,558
I believe I do believe that there's

1488
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,318
Indica in it

1489
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:36,960
oh sweet finally somebody to agree with

1490
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:39,599
me on this crap that was there I mean

1491
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,679
The Taste sure the taster

1492
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:47,099
um suggests it right yeah flavor the hip

1493
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:51,358
the hit was just boom and look I

1494
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:52,519
remember I simplified Indica right so I

1495
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,039
mean I don't know

1496
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:57,838
you know I mean wide Leaf Indica had all

1497
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:00,058
these things I'm sorry keep going so

1498
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,159
remember when

1499
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:03,660
uh

1500
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:07,078
uh in the in the

1501
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:09,899
20s there were several pharmaceutical

1502
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:13,039
companies that came through here in

1503
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:15,900
Santa Marta in the peninsula

1504
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,000
and one of them was bear

1505
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,700
and what they brought with them this is

1506
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,619
all factual this all really happened and

1507
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:26,399
they brought with them what was called

1508
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:30,599
uh Indian hemp

1509
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:33,240
and this was Indica from India India or

1510
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:35,220
their pictures for several years they

1511
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:37,679
had developed one of the strongest

1512
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:39,719
cannabinoid producing plants that had

1513
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:43,798
ever been discovered up till then even

1514
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:46,858
better than in in India yeah but at the

1515
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:49,440
same time that was right when marijuana

1516
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:52,558
was demonized in the United States and

1517
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,480
all cannabis medicine was pulled you

1518
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,960
know they in the in the beginning of the

1519
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,420
30s they they started so they all pulled

1520
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:03,059
out all these pharmaceutical companies

1521
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,639
but the the campesinos the Colombians

1522
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:08,579
they kept the seeds yeah and they kept

1523
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:11,519
growing it you know and by the late 50s

1524
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:13,260
early 60s they had a product that was

1525
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:16,159
superior man I mean this [ __ ] would

1526
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,160
knock you on your ass

1527
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:22,919
what part of the country was the kind of

1528
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:25,019
the epicenter for this

1529
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,200
well this this from what I understand

1530
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:30,719
was all in on the coast Santa Martha and

1531
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:34,259
la wahia which is a peninsula that goes

1532
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:36,118
out uh close to Venezuela now when I've

1533
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,579
thrown this out to people before they

1534
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:41,358
said you know Santa Marta is an unlikely

1535
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:44,400
place for a big Pharma company to go

1536
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:46,679
locate an operation like this you know

1537
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,099
that they're big businesses do things

1538
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:53,098
big business way he just said it didn't

1539
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:55,200
seem to click right with that what what

1540
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:57,539
do you think about that

1541
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,699
well I believe it's pretty much a fact

1542
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:01,139
and is documented that they were in

1543
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:02,399
Santa Martha I don't know if they

1544
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,500
actually had

1545
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,680
yeah I don't know the plantations there

1546
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:10,019
let me tell you the Santa Monica this

1547
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,539
this entire cordello that goes up it's

1548
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:15,719
the highest coastal range in the world

1549
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:18,058
it goes from sea level up to 20

1550
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,399
something thousand feet snow-capped

1551
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:22,140
mountains yeah there's a million

1552
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,260
microclimates there and it's

1553
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:27,298
inaccessible it's still very remote to

1554
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,760
to go there you have to hike in and

1555
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:31,940
everything else

1556
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,140
so I I can see there

1557
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:36,179
you know that's where they were

1558
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:38,699
exporting all the gold they were they

1559
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:43,818
were actually using tractors to to farm

1560
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:43,818
the Cannabis there oh wow yeah

1561
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:51,659
contrasted with Afghanistan you know or

1562
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,640
India I don't know you know the climate

1563
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:56,460
I'm just wondering how

1564
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:58,618
how how much selection pressure the

1565
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,260
difference in the climate really placed

1566
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:03,000
on the these foreign strains that they'd

1567
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:06,660
brought there you know what what what

1568
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:10,199
survived what thrived in the new

1569
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:12,659
new world right and how did that turn

1570
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:15,239
out looking 20 years later and and was

1571
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:17,279
it by the hand of man or you know were

1572
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,739
these things that was it done in two

1573
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,519
crosses and then sat in a freezer I mean

1574
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,519
because that

1575
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,740
it does yeah yeah from from my

1576
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:31,139
experience of of growing here

1577
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:34,399
uh environments everything I mean

1578
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:37,379
genetics are a good 50 but the other 50

1579
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,079
is the environment and I've taken a

1580
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:43,079
clone the same clone and brought it down

1581
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,180
500 meters to a different location it's

1582
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:48,119
a very very close to the original but

1583
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:52,500
500 meters down totally different plant

1584
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:54,660
yeah yeah totally different morphology I

1585
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:57,599
mean it still has what I what I did it

1586
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:59,940
with was my uh uh it's a train wreck

1587
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,220
Panama that I really like and I grew a

1588
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:05,220
clone in supercon and I took another

1589
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:09,118
clone down the kachupai which is down in

1590
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:10,919
the valley about 500 meters lower yeah

1591
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,200
and the guy grew it for me and we

1592
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,420
compared Buds and everything and it was

1593
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,519
different it was really different wow

1594
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,259
that's wild like um did you get to see

1595
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:25,980
the difference in the the leaf width

1596
01:08:21,259 --> 01:08:28,319
well yeah yeah the the no I really can't

1597
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:31,379
say there was a difference in that but

1598
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,359
they were shorter and swatter the higher

1599
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,400
up it went and the lower controls down

1600
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,900
the more they try to get bigger and

1601
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:39,778
bushier

1602
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:42,119
see I could grow right now at a much

1603
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:44,219
lower elevation and it'd probably be a

1604
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:46,259
lot easier but the pathogens and the

1605
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,798
insects are and I don't want to live

1606
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:53,238
there I don't want to live yeah

1607
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:55,738
I could understand that yeah so let's go

1608
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:57,479
that's that's a big part of it right why

1609
01:08:55,738 --> 01:09:01,099
you went down there and everything

1610
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:01,099
absolutely it still is

1611
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:08,640
I'm still looking for that perfect that

1612
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:11,160
just that Niche you know perfect sure

1613
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,819
topology is very important Colombians

1614
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:16,559
like Mexico it's really really

1615
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:18,660
mountainous is there bamboo or they're

1616
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,699
like big band we could build a giant

1617
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:26,159
bamboo freaking like Master Command

1618
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:28,919
Center kind of jutting out of a hillside

1619
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:32,399
all all cantilevered and stuff you know

1620
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,600
with big big support beams and and we'd

1621
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,099
have a view of the whole valley

1622
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,219
underneath us

1623
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:40,079
and uh the sound of of you know like

1624
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:42,899
bongo drums would be playing in the

1625
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:45,600
background Non-Stop and the smoke would

1626
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:48,960
waft through the air and oh yeah but

1627
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:52,259
occasionally uh you'd run into other

1628
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,140
times Thai in particular tie stick I I

1629
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:58,079
never owned Thai stick but I smoked a

1630
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:00,539
little bit of it and uh there was a

1631
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:02,939
bunch of good Mexicans Jamaican we used

1632
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:04,738
to get real Jamaican that was pretty

1633
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:08,519
good at first

1634
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:11,159
uh real CD brown but had a had a really

1635
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,500
uplifting clean High all right we'll put

1636
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:15,779
a time put a time stamp on that because

1637
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,179
you know when when was it good and then

1638
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:20,819
it wasn't good what's can you help us

1639
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:24,960
with that it was good around when I

1640
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:26,759
first tried it around 77. I was pretty

1641
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,039
good it was good it was better than

1642
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:33,840
maybe our equal to good Colombian and by

1643
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,658
1982 when I returned to the United

1644
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,199
States it was [ __ ] man it wasn't it's

1645
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:44,460
all seeds it wasn't any good yeah 82 and

1646
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:47,039
later right yep and 82 is when I started

1647
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,840
really seeing sense of media the

1648
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,840
Colombian was pretty much gone

1649
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:56,579
I seem to remember a story about that

1650
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:59,340
the Colombians started using Jamaica as

1651
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:01,619
a waypoint for smoke or somebody in

1652
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,679
South America started using Jamaica as a

1653
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:07,439
stopover point for smuggling powders

1654
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:10,260
into the U.S and it really changed the

1655
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:12,960
the whole environment maybe maybe your

1656
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:15,539
supply line of of the good stuff from

1657
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,520
the island was just interrupted and and

1658
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:19,140
that it still existed there but you guys

1659
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,940
just weren't getting it that's always a

1660
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,940
possibility right

1661
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:27,479
yeah well like I said I had a very

1662
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:30,419
limited I I I didn't know big like mad

1663
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:32,759
Jag I didn't know big people like that I

1664
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,699
just knew people on the street snoozers

1665
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,199
regular guy

1666
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:40,259
that's how I picture it anyway so don't

1667
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:43,379
spoil it with anything let me tell you a

1668
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:45,659
quick quick story about bamboo and Kachi

1669
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:48,659
pie what are we gonna do man we're

1670
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:48,658
is

1671
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:56,520
lower elevation than zupacon it's on the

1672
01:11:53,640 --> 01:12:00,840
same road it's on the same it's a Camino

1673
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:03,900
Real it's an ancient Road Spanish Road

1674
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,760
but uh so that's out of the uh out of

1675
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:08,279
the below the cloud layer

1676
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,560
yes this is this is below that cloud

1677
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:13,679
layer now you're getting down into about

1678
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,940
1 500 meters

1679
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:22,199
where zpicon is up around 2 000 meters

1680
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:24,419
and bogota's 2700 meters

1681
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:31,559
so it's going up you're going up this

1682
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:33,600
giant Plateau well how far how far in um

1683
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,699
preferably in Miles because I don't

1684
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,539
understand kilometers a bit because I'm

1685
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:41,939
a dumb American but but how far from

1686
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:43,738
Bogota are you when you're talking about

1687
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:46,319
zepocon from

1688
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:49,198
like Bogota miles wise

1689
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,960
uh well everything's about two hours

1690
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:54,238
distance okay yeah that's helpful but

1691
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,640
two hours like driving up a mountain

1692
01:12:54,238 --> 01:13:00,000
that's crazy roads or

1693
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:03,480
well maybe one hour of it the other that

1694
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,219
we have really good Autobahn quality uh

1695
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:08,339
roads here really highways super

1696
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:10,800
highways it's when you get into the road

1697
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,840
that goes from the main Highway down to

1698
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,779
supercon then it starts getting to be

1699
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,020
like a real twisty

1700
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:22,259
I mean it's it's it's safe but there's

1701
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:24,659
always Rock slides and

1702
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,300
safe don't worry about it just some rock

1703
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:29,219
slides

1704
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:30,960
and spiders are there are there like a

1705
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:34,140
lot of poison spiders down there because

1706
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,779
Australia is filled with those things so

1707
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,940
now I got bit by some kind of spider and

1708
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,920
zupacon got sick and went to the doctor

1709
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:42,960
they give me some kind of antihistamine

1710
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,440
that almost gave me a heart attack but

1711
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:50,039
no I never see them very much because

1712
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:54,019
I'm up in altitude where I am there's no

1713
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:57,119
flies no spiders it's clean beautiful

1714
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:58,440
temperate climate cement this guy's got

1715
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,198
it figured out

1716
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:02,939
I know yeah that's how long is the first

1717
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,919
thing I asked him what it wasn't about

1718
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:07,799
the safety it was how bad are the

1719
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,960
insects I'm terrified of insects I can

1720
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,539
take humans I'm okay with I can deal

1721
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,698
with that fish insects they suck man

1722
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:17,340
it's an army they're marching the Earth

1723
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:20,339
right now they have a plan

1724
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:22,079
you know we don't even notice it's

1725
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,760
happening around us because their their

1726
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,158
timeline is just completely different

1727
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:30,539
from humans but yeah and pretty soon

1728
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:32,899
yeah it's too late

1729
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:32,899
yeah

1730
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:39,419

1738
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:59,279

1739
01:14:56,939 --> 01:15:02,039

1740
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:04,319
the street and he's like yeah man I know

1741
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,140
where the bamboo is you know so he hops

1742
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:09,119
in the truck and we start going down the

1743
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,340
valley and he says keep going keep going

1744
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,179
we're passing this door passing that

1745
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,579
store

1746
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:18,060
now suddenly we're in the middle of this

1747
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:20,880
giant bamboo Grove OR

1748
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:22,860
it's all bamboo yeah and he jumps we

1749
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,980
were looking for a store to buy it you

1750
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:27,439
know no man I'll chop it down for you

1751
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:31,979

1752
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:35,219
yeah wow hand-picked only the good stuff

1753
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:37,619
how big was it how big was it I'm just

1754
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:40,140
curious what you know well it's not

1755
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:42,119
actually bamboo uh it's it's some other

1756
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,219
plant that's similar to Bamboo that

1757
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,679
grows here but it was about that big in

1758
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:49,920
diameter it was that mid-sized tubes

1759
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:52,199
yeah that's no joke wow

1760
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,000
but uh it was a fun adventure because

1761
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:55,979
this guy was like kept saying we were

1762
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,560
going I was wondering where the hell is

1763
01:15:55,979 --> 01:16:00,359
this guy taking us man well speaking of

1764
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,239
words he's taking us it seems like

1765
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:05,420
you've taken us to Columbia already at

1766
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:08,819
this point how did we get there

1767
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:11,340
I mean just timelining it right that's

1768
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:14,099
uh I'm gonna be chopping things around

1769
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,440
yeah so are they doing are they doing

1770
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,440
big indoor operations down there and is

1771
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:22,500
that affordable like kilowatt hour

1772
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:24,238
price yeah

1773
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:28,260
I mean

1774
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:30,839
oh yeah they'll they the reason cannabis

1775
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:34,140
foreign cannabis companies come here is

1776
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:36,000
to exploit the people because here the

1777
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,340
people work for a hundred dollars a

1778
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
month and that's a pretty good rate yeah

1779
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:45,119
and the electricity is real cheap here

1780
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,960
God how blind you know I mean how big

1781
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:51,719
big industry rolls into you know the the

1782
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,260
hotbed of cannabis in the world you know

1783
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:57,899
besides Thailand probably right now and

1784
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:01,400
they ignore the Nash the natural

1785
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:04,979
treasure that is that lives only there

1786
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:08,719
and uh see it just as another as another

1787
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:10,519
uh resource pit to be steamrolled

1788
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:14,520
exploitation

1789
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:16,860
what a nightmare like every commodity

1790
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:19,980
okay but let me tell you what they do

1791
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:22,679
there's a big German company gmw

1792
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:25,738
Laboratories right here in Piper

1793
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:28,800
and they have uh I don't know if I I

1794
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:31,819
guess it's about 10 acres of greenhouses

1795
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,640
and what they do is run

1796
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:37,399
non-psychoactive and it's all on hydro

1797
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:42,659
hydroponics in greenhouses

1798
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:46,759
it's set up hold on they're growing hemp

1799
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:48,439
with Hydro in greenhouses

1800
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:52,500
wait

1801
01:17:48,439 --> 01:17:55,198
oh my god well it's non-psychoactive

1802
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,899
it's to me it's hemp but it's yeah yeah

1803
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:01,259
it's like candy dad

1804
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:04,979
okay yeah Harlequin and AC DC

1805
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:07,500
Harley Quinn uh uh all the the what's

1806
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:09,839
the other one the

1807
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:12,359
Charlotte's Web all those yeah yeah yeah

1808
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,039
these are these are ones I don't want to

1809
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:15,420
work with and I don't really even like I

1810
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:17,460
have many of them and I don't really

1811
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,840
want to grow any more of it

1812
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:21,658
no yeah

1813
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,760
but that here's the kicker when I went

1814
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:26,039
there they're all wanting me to help

1815
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,340
them and everything and I'm doing the

1816
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:31,019
tour I'm wearing this this HEPA suit or

1817
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:34,260
something you know with all this stuff

1818
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:36,060
on and yeah and uh I really didn't like

1819
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:39,020
it and they said okay here's where we do

1820
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:42,860
our drying we put it in the drying oven

1821
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:42,860
for 24 hours

1822
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:52,199
what the [ __ ] dude yeah and this young

1823
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,239
young Colombian guy comes out is in the

1824
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:56,460
scientist outfit and I said what are you

1825
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:59,039
doing man don't you understand he

1826
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,600
destroys all those beautiful volatile

1827
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:04,319
terpenes and things

1828
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:06,840
and he had no concept of that

1829
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,559
well he does he did after he talked to

1830
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,739
you

1831
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:14,460
yeah well now now that it changed and

1832
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:16,799
they've gone to uh dry freezing

1833
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,980
which I think is a very better change

1834
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,659
because they're getting but it's still

1835
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:24,059
non-psychoactive it's all CBD

1836
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:26,698
and it's all sitting in a warehouse they

1837
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:30,500
haven't sold one gram

1838
01:19:26,698 --> 01:19:33,658
yeah sounds like the the United States

1839
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:37,020
coming to a gas station near you yeah

1840
01:19:33,658 --> 01:19:40,019
yeah exactly it like when I when I did

1841
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,880
that big hemp reversal and got to go out

1842
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:44,159
to the big fields and stuff and see what

1843
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,920
they did at the with the end product

1844
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:49,879
it was literally tossed in fields of

1845
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:53,940
dirt with goat heads in it just piled up

1846
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:56,279
not even in crates just dirt on the dirt

1847
01:19:53,939 --> 01:19:58,678
and they just had people come scoop it

1848
01:19:56,279 --> 01:20:01,859
up turn it into isolate move it on and

1849
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:04,020
biomass I I was just I was mind blown

1850
01:20:01,859 --> 01:20:05,399
how it was kept not even in crates in

1851
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:07,739
the dirt just

1852
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:12,500
in the dirt out in the open Fields just

1853
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:12,500
to get everything it's gross

1854
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:20,280
yeah I have no interest in big big

1855
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:22,198
operations I I don't want to be involved

1856
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:24,840
I don't want to talk to those people

1857
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:27,238
what I enjoy is growing the best that I

1858
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,219
can and teaching the young people I know

1859
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:31,559
how to do what I do

1860
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:34,679
it's a completely different craft in my

1861
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,659
opinion like it's a totally different it

1862
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:38,658
they're almost unrelated except that

1863
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:41,698
they happen to work with a similar plant

1864
01:20:38,658 --> 01:20:43,859
when you come when you come and see me

1865
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:45,559
and you smoke with me you'll know the

1866
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:48,179
difference

1867
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:50,400
you'll see the light you I can tell you

1868
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:53,279
I can draw you pictures send you videos

1869
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,859
but do you hit that do you hit it with

1870
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:57,840
me

1871
01:20:54,859 --> 01:21:00,658
that's the only way to truly tell it

1872
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:04,020
really is hey man I've got a question

1873
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:06,059
about you know the emerging Colombian

1874
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:08,040
um commercial scene right so they're

1875
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:10,320
they're I assume red they're going to

1876
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:13,198
start having dispensaries and stuff pop

1877
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:16,439
up and it's and uh retail you know it's

1878
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,059
going to become a retail product

1879
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,799
um you know fancy packaging and

1880
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:23,520
everything like it does everywhere else

1881
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,739
to fill our landfills but um

1882
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,780
so Matt I mean you saw it out in

1883
01:21:25,738 --> 01:21:29,759
California

1884
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:33,359
um I'm sure you have some thoughts about

1885
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:37,619
the the dispensaries as the kind of

1886
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:41,519
taste maker uh the opinion shaper for in

1887
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:44,099
a commercial legal recreational market

1888
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,960
like that you know do people just buy

1889
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:49,440
what they're pointed to when they walk

1890
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:52,739
into the store yes and and is it all

1891
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:56,519
just about looks and and nothing about

1892
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:59,099
effect nothing like am I on the mutation

1893
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,600
yeah in California the way I've always

1894
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,739
seen it work and I've been to a lot of

1895
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,920
different places in a lot of different

1896
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:09,000
cities even even in Colorado and uh

1897
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,039
Oregon it's a bud tender who has zero

1898
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,340
experience or knowledge in my opinion

1899
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:16,619
I've never met it's so rare unless it's

1900
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,140
like a friend that I've had like kind of

1901
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:22,079
put into a dispensary that I know knows

1902
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:25,140
their stuff and that's so rare but

1903
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,760
it I just never really just on occasion

1904
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,320
met someone that really knew what they

1905
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,420
were talking about I'd see oh you want a

1906
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:33,259
hybrid but even if you're going to be

1907
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:36,060
sleepy get a hybrid

1908
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:38,039
are they even gonna have anything though

1909
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:43,880
I mean are they would they even have a

1910
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:46,019
narrow uh no I mean 16 week

1911
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,659
there's no way there's no way because

1912
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:52,860
they'd be paying nobody grows out here

1913
01:22:48,658 --> 01:22:54,179
so I mean how does how does Colombia do

1914
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:56,880
it different

1915
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:59,039
what what kind of changes could you know

1916
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,020
I mean if if you had it to do over again

1917
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:03,719
Matt you've seen it up close and

1918
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:07,199
personal I mean how would How would how

1919
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:09,239
can it be done differently to and I this

1920
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,759
seems like a Sidetrack but I think red

1921
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:14,279
has kind of a vested interest in this

1922
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,840
stuff and and you've got knowledge and

1923
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:18,420
experience

1924
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,920
you know I I don't know that I would be

1925
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,300
the right person to ask on how to do it

1926
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,579
different because I'm such a pessimist

1927
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,679
but I'm interested in Red's opinion on

1928
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:27,359
how he would do it different than what

1929
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,940
he said

1930
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:33,179
well first of all recreational or

1931
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:37,139
personal use is not legal here

1932
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:40,140
but it is now you can you can have up to

1933
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:42,300
20 grams it's just not commercialized

1934
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,840
not regulated but you can have 20 grams

1935
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:49,980
of weed you can have five grams of hash

1936
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:53,579
legally okay but uh the laws have not

1937
01:23:49,979 --> 01:23:57,539
changed and what they consider more than

1938
01:23:53,579 --> 01:24:00,840
19 plants is micro trafficking that

1939
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:03,840
you're you're selling it micro

1940
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,940
right but I think it's going to follow

1941
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,860
where you are I think it's going to be

1942
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:09,960
because they love California they're

1943
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:12,779
always looking at the laws there they're

1944
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:15,420
always modeling things after up there

1945
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:18,300
that is so scary right because it just

1946
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:20,760
it just like what what we realized or

1947
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:24,000
what I realized really early on being

1948
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:27,420
from the the grower side

1949
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,840
was that the more corporate it got the

1950
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:33,119
more legal or quasi-legal it looked for

1951
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,159
people to be able to smoke

1952
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:38,279
while they're still trying to push

1953
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:39,899
through these like THC percent maximum

1954
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:43,439
max out type things in the background

1955
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:45,719
but they made it more illegal or more

1956
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:48,238
easy to tax the [ __ ] out of you if you

1957
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:50,698
grow and took the ability for you to

1958
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:54,379
produce your own medicine for free at

1959
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:57,539
home away from you and people

1960
01:24:54,380 --> 01:25:00,239
like the idea of just being able to go

1961
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:01,979
buy it as an end product more than they

1962
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,959
like the idea of being able to grow it

1963
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:06,899
because it just seems like a lot to do

1964
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:10,399
but in the end I think it's a big loss

1965
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,399
for everyone to go that route

1966
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:16,260
well remember remember too though that

1967
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:18,179
here is a lot different I mean you can

1968
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,039
flower year round you don't have to set

1969
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:23,100
up lights you don't have to put a lot of

1970
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:25,979
effort into growing it like that

1971
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:28,320
but I I and I don't want to offend I

1972
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:30,658
have more respect for Colombians and the

1973
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:33,359
Colombians themselves but the thing

1974
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:35,939
about them is they like fads they like

1975
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,679
the you know they want to do what you're

1976
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:40,919
doing you know they want to do what's

1977
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:43,199
going on in New York and stuff so that a

1978
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,239
lot of it's you can go now they have

1979
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:47,939
dispensaries where you can go and and

1980
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:50,639
you can walk in and buy weed leaves yeah

1981
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:52,738
well not legally but you know you can

1982
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:55,739

1983
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:57,779

1984
01:25:55,738 --> 01:26:00,259
potatoes and corn and you can buy weed

1985
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:02,579

even break it down just jump in the taxi

1989
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,899

1990
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:11,899
hanging out the window

1991
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:18,238
does the police or government mess with

1992
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,800
people a lot or try to tax them at that

1993
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,859
point when they see it or how does that

1994
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:26,460
work well mostly they they

1995
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:29,039
get you when you're moving you know like

1996
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:32,520
if you go to a bus station or if you go

1997
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:35,639

1998
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:38,100

1999
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:40,679
had anybody come in my house and

2000
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:43,199
uh I don't want to get myself in trouble

2001
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:45,779
but I've grown a lot more than 20 plants

2002
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:48,359

01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:58,198
right now I don't know if you know it

2007
01:26:56,698 --> 01:27:00,299
but if you look at the news they're

2008
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:03,359
having these big cannabis marches

2009
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:06,480
because they want the new president to

2010
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,559
sign into law the what they call adult

2011

and getting it all set up the thing is

2019

01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:15,059

2102
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:17,219
buy a pound of it I don't have a pound

2103
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:20,820

2104
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:24,179
or Rojo or what man yeah because he got

2105
01:31:20,819 --> 01:31:26,579
those before yeah and uh I met him on

2106
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:28,199
the street because my wife even after

2107
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:30,600
all these years wouldn't let him come in

2108
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:32,698
her house and I met him on the street he

2109
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:36,120
said James it opens up this newspaper

2110
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:40,079
like he had it wrapped in newspaper and

2111
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:42,779

white widows would have called it and it

2116
01:31:49,859 --> 01:31:55,319
looked like white widow yeah and uh it

2117
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:57,779
was quite a bit more expensive but I I

2118
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:59,279
went ahead and bought it it was about 2

2119
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:02,460
000 uh gram

2120

2122
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,000
yeah

2123
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:12,119
but anyway so I bought some and at first

2124
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,399
I liked it man it was really good the

2125
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:15,840
next time I got it he said this is skunk

2126
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,539

2127
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,760
and he'd never he's never heard he

2128
01:32:18,539 --> 01:32:23,639
doesn't know these names man yeah yeah

2129
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:26,579
and it was beautiful I have photos of it

2130
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:29,579
beautiful dark green with red hairs

2131
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:32,519
going through it real flowery smell yeah

2132
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:37,979
nice up high I guess was skunk number

2133
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:40,139
one okay okay then uh I then it changed

2134
01:32:37,979 --> 01:32:43,138
then then it changed I started getting

2135
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:44,520
it from another guy and it was these big

2136
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:48,319
clumps

2137
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:52,980
like a big hard clump of compressed or

2138
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:55,799
vacuum bagged uh again Indica Bud yeah

2139
01:32:52,979 --> 01:32:57,539
seedless completely seedless no I guess

2140
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,340
it was like beasters

2141
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:01,319
gotcha

2142
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:03,539
and uh

2143
01:33:01,319 --> 01:33:05,460
that was the creepy and pretty soon I

2144
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:07,380
didn't like it that much although I

2145
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:11,158
bought it because I wasn't growing at

2146
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:13,440
the time yeah but I did find one seed I

2147
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:15,238
found a seed in it normally I never have

2148
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:17,039
found seeds so if you have seeds you're

2149
01:33:15,238 --> 01:33:21,059
lucky yeah yeah

2150
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:23,819
but what year did you first encounter it

2151
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:26,760
okay when I first saw creepy it was the

2152
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:28,019
beginning of 2012. interesting because

2153
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,539
that's about the time that I got those

2154
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:31,800
seeds sent up that's I was like I just I

2155
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:35,579
wonder if this is the same guy because

2156
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:37,860
like it was on Mr Nice same era and the

2157
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:39,359
guy when he sent it to me he spelled it

2158
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:42,179
creepy

2159
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:44,099
and I was like uh I don't know like I'd

2160
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:46,260
never heard of that and then later on I

2161
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:48,000
saw another Colombian spell at [ __ ] and

2162
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:50,179
I was like oh my God maybe the dude was

2163
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,399
right you know like he wasn't just

2164
01:33:50,179 --> 01:33:55,440
calling you creepy because that's very

2165
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:58,198
possible this is a common nickname for

2166
01:33:55,439 --> 01:34:01,460
me well you kind of came across that way

2167
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:03,779
in some of those posts and and you know

2168
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:05,399
the males might have been in the the

2169
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:07,439
seeds might have been in the mail before

2170
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:10,679
he kind of realized hey this guy's kind

2171
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:12,719
of creepy and he said here's some creepy

2172
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:16,880
for you yeah yeah this is possible

2173
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:20,100
you're creepy I said some creepy things

2174
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:22,460
but but creepy is outdoor grown it's

2175
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:26,940
grown and uh well I live in Colombia

2176
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:30,359
antiochia calca even even up in uh near

2177
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:32,638
Cartagena and let me tell you I don't I

2178
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:34,439
I'm naturally against it and don't like

2179
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,239
it because number one I don't smoke a

2180
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:40,319
lot of Indica number two it's commercial

2181
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:43,500
and yeah and it gives me a bad fact the

2182
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:46,079
negative effect it does mean yeah but in

2183
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:48,658
Cartagena when I bought a nice chunk of

2184
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:51,960
it it was excellent man it was it was

2185
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:55,138
uplifting it was uh really a good but it

2186
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:58,198
looked just like the other indica

2187
01:34:55,139 --> 01:35:00,960
plump but it had a stellar High brought

2188
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:02,460
some back with me from uh Cartagena two

2189
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,579
years ago

2190
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:09,060
and I also got some in Santa Martha that

2191
01:35:05,579 --> 01:35:11,639
was uh it wasn't the same as what I had

2192
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,679
in Carter half so it would you real real

2193
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:15,420
quick I'm sorry Matt the uh

2194
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,219
um these guys they're it's industrial

2195
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:19,980
they're they're they're growing for

2196
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:22,380
profit they you know what how are they

2197
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:23,759
about chemicals and pesticides and stuff

2198
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:27,420
like that I mean are you getting a clean

2199
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,500
product with this or what is it full of

2200
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:32,219
chemicals

2201
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:35,639
oh yeah no flushing either I mean it

2202
01:35:32,219 --> 01:35:38,039
burns black so a lot of it burns black

2203
01:35:35,639 --> 01:35:40,739
now there there it varies there's a

2204
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:43,019
bunch of different types of it

2205
01:35:40,738 --> 01:35:45,419
but the real shitty stuff Burns black

2206
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:47,400
and has a cami taste and they all use

2207
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:50,399
pesticide chemicals

2208
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:52,379
they have to yeah it makes sense

2209
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:53,759
um so would you say because I know

2210
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,619
people are gonna

2211
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,079
be yelling at me if I don't pin you down

2212
01:35:55,619 --> 01:36:00,479
on it would you say that

2213
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:03,359
krippy is something like and this is

2214
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:06,599
just what I'm hearing you say but maybe

2215
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:10,500
you can tell me if I'm wrong it's some

2216
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:13,199
sort of commercial probably Dutch import

2217
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,340
type like skunk one or one of those

2218
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:17,339
types

2219
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:20,960
and any of them will do it's just a

2220
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:24,239
non-columbian based

2221
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:27,000
afghani-based type plant grown there

2222
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:29,839
yeah he will do yeah same thing like

2223
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,579
they did in Mexico I mean exactly okay

2224
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,860
these aren't happy Growers that are

2225
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:37,859
doing these are people that are hand to

2226
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:39,658
mouth I mean they're survival and they

2227
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:41,399
don't even give a [ __ ] about the

2228
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:43,920
genetics or anything yeah exactly buy

2229
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:46,679
trays of clones put them out and it's a

2230
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,480
it's cartel weed it's yeah it's getting

2231
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:49,440
people that bring you cocaine make this

2232
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:54,059
[ __ ]

2233
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:56,039
yeah and so when do you think

2234
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:58,199
from people you've spoken to when do you

2235
01:36:56,039 --> 01:37:00,179
think that term crippy first started

2236
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:02,638
getting used or

2237
01:37:00,179 --> 01:37:05,760
applied to we like that

2238
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:09,079
well see I left Colombia in the summer

2239
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:12,659
of 2007 and went back to Georgia

2240
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:15,300
uh and and when I left there wasn't any

2241
01:37:12,658 --> 01:37:17,819
creepy and when I came back that's when

2242
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:20,400
it was there and I came back in 2011 and

2243
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:22,198
it was there then gotcha I don't know

2244
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,198
when it happened I bet it probably

2245
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:28,979
happened

2246
01:37:24,198 --> 01:37:31,678
2008 2009 interesting yeah

2247
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:34,439
but it's it's some of it's good some of

2248
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,779
it's bad but when you live in Colombia

2249
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:38,460
and you smoke you should be growing your

2250
01:37:36,779 --> 01:37:39,559
own weed you know yeah it sounds like

2251
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,239
this

2252
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:43,920
that's like going to a prostitute when

2253
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:47,399
you're married to Lonnie Anderson you

2254
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:49,579
know yeah right yeah that's who would

2255
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:53,719
have popped into my head too exactly

2256
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:53,719

2258
01:37:58,859 --> 01:38:03,960
get into it now but you know I lived

2259
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:06,539

super cool

2273
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:40,920

01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,960
talk to me he was one of the first

2275
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,779
people that had a really what I

2276
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,698
considered a larger seed company that

2277
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:50,279
that would talk to me and that was a

2278
01:38:47,698 --> 01:38:52,259
serious breeder so yeah shout out to him

2279
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:54,420
hopefully he is doing it I believe he

2280
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:57,179

2281
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,500
Spanish seed bank yeah that's very

2282
01:38:57,179 --> 01:39:01,020

yeah yeah that's not his real name and

2303
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,960
of course I want the Bulge that but

2304
01:39:53,698 --> 01:39:57,000
anyway uh

2305
01:39:54,960 --> 01:40:00,480
he used to send me uh you might have

2306
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:04,380
heard of red snake uh the the oaxacan uh

2307
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:06,959
Punta Rojo cross yeah how was that oh

2308
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,699
man oh I've got better but that was

2309
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,739
excellent but that never got out

2310
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:13,019
publicly he wouldn't sell that or

2311
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:14,939
mestiza which which is another one I

2312
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,820
really like Max diesel which one was

2313
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:20,839
that

2314
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:23,219
oaxacan and Mission mcconn and yeah

2315
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:27,360
now how do you spell that because I

2316
01:40:23,219 --> 01:40:31,039
think you're saying Mex teaser with a t

2317
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:34,139
is that is that right or is okay okay

2318
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:36,719
gotcha now I think I saw that for sale

2319
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:38,279
for I saw that for sale for years that

2320
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,260
that was on the market

2321
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:42,658
yeah the mcstizo was there was a mix of

2322
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:44,940
Melia too from another company there was

2323
01:40:42,658 --> 01:40:47,638
like a oaxacan Burmese I think that

2324
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:49,619
doesn't mean that what you've got is the

2325
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:51,480
same thing as what went on the market

2326
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:52,979
though right that's very true yeah

2327
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:55,799
because a lot of the stuff like would be

2328
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:58,019
like uh whatever he worked cross to like

2329
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,420
a Malawi you know what I mean like to

2330
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:02,639
put it into Seed Market form I mean his

2331
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:05,639
his personal collection would likely be

2332
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:10,920
the you know can you imagine can you

2333
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:10,920
imagine can you read that 05.

2334
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:18,079

2339
01:41:28,859 --> 01:41:33,000

2340
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:35,940
with him that we never got to really

2341
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,579
finish here's a bunch of uh [ __ ] Beach

2342
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:40,618
that we were working with Mike but I

2343
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:43,319
don't know if you can read that well I

2344
01:41:40,618 --> 01:41:46,019
tell you Ruth my partner has gotten

2345
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:48,439
spent so much time with the health

2346
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:52,800
department the agricultural Department

2347
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:55,559
the Justice Ministry that she's really

2348
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,139
well connected with them and she knows

2349
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,100
exactly what's legal and exactly what's

2350
01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:01,980
not

2351
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:03,840
and I I I I put a lot of faith in

2352
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:06,359
everything she says of course I do what

2353
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,800
I want to do too yeah well you're

2354
01:42:06,359 --> 01:42:09,539
different you're a different part of the

2355
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
operation and you know it seems to me

2356
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:13,500
that if anybody's going to be successful

2357
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:15,179
in this in the legal cannabis World

2358
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:18,000
you've got to have somebody in the

2359
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:20,639
organization that's focused on that

2360
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,139
interface with The Regulators with

2361
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:25,440
government

2362
01:42:22,139 --> 01:42:28,199
um and who doesn't you know who who can

2363
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,238
actually do that kind of work and and be

2364
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:32,759
successful with it you know I mean some

2365
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,799
people can can do it other people hate

2366
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,440
that kind of work and avoid it at all

2367
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:40,340
costs not pointing any fingers here but

2368
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:43,198
I think there may be three people here

2369
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:45,300
who probably feel that way

2370
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,039
um so it's great that you got that

2371
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:49,619
partner you know you complimentary

2372
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:51,960
skills teaming up you're the Visionary

2373
01:42:49,618 --> 01:42:55,198
you know it when you see it you know how

2374
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:56,698
to do it she's she's handling the part

2375
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:59,519
that you're not good at and you're doing

2376
01:42:56,698 --> 01:43:02,059
the part she's not so it's awesome well

2377
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,340
I I want to really give a good uh

2378
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:08,400
recommendation to her because she she

2379
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:11,940
listens to me and and under not just

2380
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:13,500
listens to me but understands and a lot

2381
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:16,019
of people hear you but they don't

2382
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,359
understand you she understands me and

2383
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,820
understands what I want to do and

2384
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:24,738
believes in it and that we we feed off

2385
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:24,738
each other like that or I feel like that

2386
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:30,659
it's like constant roadblocks and and

2387
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,939
interruptions to your to your you know

2388
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:35,039
your dreams right so and those things

2389
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:37,618
are can can

2390
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,479
um be demotivating and depressing and a

2391
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:41,219
lot of people quit right before they get

2392
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:44,039
to the finish line so

2393
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:45,899
oh yeah Partnerships or marriages too

2394
01:43:44,039 --> 01:43:47,219
you know like they really are like

2395
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:49,198
marriages are very important

2396
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:50,520
communication is important and when

2397
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,618
you're in a serious business

2398
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:54,000
relationship with someone it's like a

2399
01:43:52,618 --> 01:43:56,339
marriage that you can't just leave

2400
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,899
because there's responsibilities there's

2401
01:43:56,340 --> 01:44:00,119
all kinds of commitments that you have

2402
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:02,339
to each other uh whether Financial or

2403
01:44:00,118 --> 01:44:04,198
otherwise and it's uh yeah it's you have

2404
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:06,179
to take it serious like that and and

2405
01:44:04,198 --> 01:44:08,759
when one of the partners is just a

2406
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:11,579
complete prick it's it's almost

2407
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,900
unlivable unmanageable and when someone

2408
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:14,519
can actually hear you and you can

2409
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:16,019
communicate with them that's that's

2410
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:18,719

like if you're just [ __ ] stacking it

2453
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:06,480
it's gonna happen naturally right like

2454
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:09,179
in some of the inside's gonna naturally

2455
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:11,519
ferment on the inside that's it it

2456
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:14,639
wasn't intentional yeah well I'm writing

um probably the same for you and there

2510
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:42,779
was a thing that happened right around

2511
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:45,179
that end of the era where all these

2512

femos when you try and grow stuff like

2581
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,698
that indoors they have a very similar

2582
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:47,279
structure but not you know that just

2583
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:48,839
looked so healthy and robust yours it

2584
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:50,819
just looked beautiful grown Outdoors

2585
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,100
like that but it's a the structure

2586
01:51:50,819 --> 01:51:55,259
indoors is really similar you know I

2587
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,639
know guys with phenos like just like

2588
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:58,260
that

2589
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:02,159
um and it's the good stuff so let's see

2590
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:04,560
mango Beach first time you have seen or

2591
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:06,839
heard of mango BJ

2592
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,420
okay uh well of course here they

2593
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:13,380
pronounce it [ __ ] Beach but but they

2594
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:15,420
mango biche means uh unripe mango that's

2595
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:17,520
what mango Beach means they sell it on

2596
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:20,779
the street corners

2597
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:24,179
but uh some people call it lemon lemon

2598
01:52:20,779 --> 01:52:27,179
lime or something I think

2599
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:27,179
something

2600
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:32,099
not my favorite I I don't like it in

2601
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,719
fact I I really don't like it what do

2602
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:35,579
you think it is like what what do you

2603
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:37,800
think is it normally the same thing or

2604
01:52:35,579 --> 01:52:40,679
is it like stuff that's presented as

2605
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:42,719
Mingo Beach that's or [ __ ] BJ that's

2606
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:44,940
not the same

2607
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:47,880
I'll tell you what it is it's very

2608
01:52:44,939 --> 01:52:51,178
intersexed it's long flowering low

2609
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:53,460
potency uh it's hard to grow it's

2610
01:52:51,179 --> 01:52:56,279
unmanageable it grows in this damn tree

2611
01:52:53,460 --> 01:53:00,779
now that's the ones I've had yeah some

2612
01:52:56,279 --> 01:53:03,479
of them I may be better holy crap that's

2613
01:53:00,779 --> 01:53:05,340
that's a laundry list of undesirable

2614
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:07,439
traits you just threw out there I think

2615
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:10,199
that pretty much waves off the entire

2616
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:13,399
world from wanting to pop that pack yeah

2617
01:53:10,198 --> 01:53:16,500
that's dropped to the bottom of the list

2618
01:53:13,399 --> 01:53:18,539
[ __ ] Beach is just like Punta Rojo it's

2619
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:21,960
a generalized name there's many

2620
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:23,819
varieties within that name yeah and and

2621
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,859
I didn't grow a lot of it remember I I

2622
01:53:23,819 --> 01:53:27,840
got this guy at the National University

2623
01:53:25,859 --> 01:53:30,238
in Bogota this

2624
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,039
the guy that I smoked him with a dude I

2625
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:33,059
got these [ __ ] beaches you've got to

2626
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:35,219
grow them out

2627
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,179
they're excellent I grew them out they

2628
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:38,060
were all

2629
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:41,819
[ __ ] noise

2630
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:44,940
these weren't Kai Keys mango Beach no no

2631
01:53:41,819 --> 01:53:46,979
no I've never grown those okay because I

2632
01:53:44,939 --> 01:53:48,658
mean you know look I mean we may as well

2633
01:53:46,979 --> 01:53:50,899
consider these things to be two

2634
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:53,339
completely different things you know

2635
01:53:50,899 --> 01:53:56,698
grew and the stuff that the rest of the

2636
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:58,980
world may have access to probably not

2637
01:53:56,698 --> 01:54:02,539
the same so I mean you know everything

2638
01:53:58,979 --> 01:54:02,539
that was wrong with that mango Beach

2639
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:10,440
we should assume that the can of Biogen

2640
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:12,779
Ace people would have uh done their done

2641
01:54:10,439 --> 01:54:15,719
their job and and created collected for

2642
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:18,059
Less oh absolutely trades yeah yeah yeah

2643
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:20,880
yeah yeah well I don't know if he still

2644
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:23,219
has it I don't even know if uh uh

2645
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,139
kaijin's still selling shoes but he he

2646
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:27,480
had to point the row hole and I know

2647
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:29,880
where the Spoonful Rojo came from oh can

2648
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:34,698
you talk about that drawing it and it's

2649
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:34,699
it is good put the Rojo

2650
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,900
yes Punta Rojo he came here uh I forget

2651
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:42,479
I don't know remember what year it was

2652
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:44,519
it was in the 2000s they came here to

2653
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:46,559
Colombian and hooked up with his buddies

2654
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:49,800
went to manazales

2655
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:52,980
but Gonzalez is a really unique place an

2656
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:56,159
elevation and climate and everything and

2657
01:54:52,979 --> 01:54:59,879
uh he sourced the the punto Rojo from

2658
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:03,479
Manas Hollis or that area which is also

2659
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:05,639
which is also where the uh wacky weeds

2660
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:08,039
some of the wacky weed manozola's black

2661
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:10,618
is from there is that what wacky wheat

2662
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:11,600
is is man as always black that's one of

2663
01:55:10,618 --> 01:55:14,219
them

2664
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:17,699
the original one I believed to have come

2665
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:19,439
from kalka the candy bar I know that's

2666
01:55:17,698 --> 01:55:22,198
another story I got to tell you yes

2667
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,359
please but uh the anyway getting back to

2668
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:28,319
the punto Rojo I've got photos and

2669
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:31,259
everything I grew it in Bogota 2016.

2670
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:34,019
uh but you gotta realize when you're

2671
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:35,760
when you're this this kind of a plant is

2672
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:37,560
different than what you're got and you

2673
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,960
guys it's not a cruise it's not an OG

2674
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:42,719
it's nothing like that it's not a this

2675
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:44,340
is uh it's potent but it's it doesn't

2676
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:46,500
look like it you know what I mean

2677
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:50,159
there's they don't see a lot of Crystal

2678
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:52,679
you know it's not all all uh trichomed

2679
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:55,079
up it's not a big mess

2680
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:57,060
when you open that butt up when you open

2681
01:55:55,079 --> 01:55:59,760
that flower up and start breaking it up

2682
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:01,980
there's these little like sand size

2683
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:04,560
trichomes

2684
01:56:01,979 --> 01:56:07,618
and uh but it's not that it's the flavor

2685
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,960
and of course the flavor all these all

2686
01:56:07,618 --> 01:56:12,599
these variables are in your environment

2687
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:15,118
I I mean you get a lot of it from the

2688
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:17,520
genetics but if you grow it in guano you

2689
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:19,920
get a different taste oh sure yeah if

2690
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:22,560
you grow it in chemical stuff you get a

2691
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:25,500
different taste but it is the real deal

2692
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,239
and and I like it I just don't I I'm not

2693
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,340
growing it right now but I definitely

2694
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:31,618
gonna grow it again because and I have a

2695
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:33,420
bunch of the good seeds from from that

2696
01:56:31,618 --> 01:56:36,139
that's what I was going to ask red is

2697
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:38,699
you know um kaiki

2698
01:56:36,139 --> 01:56:41,100
Ace released multiple versions

2699
01:56:38,698 --> 01:56:43,939
iterations of this stuff I believe some

2700
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:46,500
of them outcrossed with other other red

2701
01:56:43,939 --> 01:56:49,138
uh South American Central American

2702
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:50,880
sativas so I'm just kind of wondering if

2703
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:53,819
you have any more detail where this

2704
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:56,340
might fall on that um timeline of of

2705
01:56:53,819 --> 01:56:59,000
stuff that was actually released by CBG

2706
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:59,000
or Ace

2707
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:05,340
well I believe the Punta Rojo seeds that

2708
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:07,618
I have and I grew here are the ones that

2709
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:10,619
in fact I know they are because I helped

2710
01:57:07,618 --> 01:57:12,960
them package the the little what who

2711
01:57:10,618 --> 01:57:15,420
sells them in yeah so it's the original

2712
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:19,020
what I have is what is

2713
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:20,760
was it a hot was it a Repro I mean what

2714
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:24,119
you what you've got there are they Repro

2715
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:27,119
seeds is it um you know I it's okay it's

2716
01:57:24,118 --> 01:57:30,118
okay I'm not sure I'm not sure because

2717
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:32,819
he had many things sent from Spain

2718
01:57:30,118 --> 01:57:36,000
yeah many many seeds and things were

2719
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:36,899
even had cuts from Spain he brought cuts

2720
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,420
from there

2721
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:41,579
yeah but I believe I believe these have

2722
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:43,739
been worked I don't believe they're the

2723
01:57:41,579 --> 01:57:45,899
directly from the bag that he got the

2724
01:57:43,738 --> 01:57:47,759
seeds from in Colombia I think they've

2725
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:50,158
they've because there was no

2726
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:52,260
hermaphrodites I grew like 12 of them

2727
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:54,719
yeah there was true there was three true

2728
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,639
males and I don't know seven females and

2729
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:00,480
they were excellent man I'll show you

2730
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:02,340
the photos wow they're tall colas single

2731
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:04,678
stack rollers

2732
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:07,139
has this kind of uh I don't know it's

2733
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:08,579
it's like Suitor but it's like a wood

2734
01:58:07,139 --> 01:58:11,760
smell

2735
01:58:08,579 --> 01:58:14,158
it's not exactly Cedar it's more like a

2736
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:17,940
not Pine either you'd have to smell it

2737
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:19,799
but it's a woody type dark wood smell it

2738
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:22,079
sounds like exactly what we'd expect

2739
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,900
from something named printer Rojo right

2740
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:27,840
oh it's excellent and of course you know

2741
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:31,039
that just it just means red tips red

2742
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:33,659
point right right

2743
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:35,639
and there's another one right what is it

2744
01:58:33,658 --> 01:58:38,819
the uh

2745
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:40,260
well another one there's there's ones

2746
01:58:38,819 --> 01:58:44,340
you know about the United States like

2747
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:46,739
that choco Chiba yeah okay choco is a

2748
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:48,539
department is a department on the

2749
01:58:46,738 --> 01:58:51,479
Pacific coast and it's

2750
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:55,979
it's not suitable for growing cannabis

2751
01:58:51,479 --> 01:58:58,198
it's very humid it's very jungly so

2752
01:58:55,979 --> 01:59:00,959
maybe there was people that said that

2753
01:58:58,198 --> 01:59:03,178
but I've never ever heard of cannabis

2754
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,520
been have been produced there but it may

2755
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:07,079
be I mean it may very well be but I've

2756
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,940
never heard of it

2757
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:11,698
so the the first time I saw that

2758
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:13,979
referenced was in an old article I want

2759
01:59:11,698 --> 01:59:16,919
to say it was R but I I might be wrong

2760
01:59:13,979 --> 01:59:18,899
it was an old article on Colombians

2761
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,359
talking about the very first Colombians

2762
01:59:18,899 --> 01:59:24,299
and where they were being pushed out of

2763
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:26,279
and it was I want to say he didn't say

2764
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:29,400
choco Chiba he just called it Chiba

2765
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:32,519
Colombian at the time I've heard that

2766
01:59:29,399 --> 01:59:34,618
word before here yeah he just said Chiba

2767
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:38,420
Colombian so I didn't know if Chiba was

2768
01:59:34,618 --> 01:59:38,420
a province or town or

2769
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:43,980
that's just a reference for something

2770
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:47,698
that's good like like uh uh what's the

2771
01:59:43,979 --> 01:59:51,118
other one Primo chimba when whenever

2772
01:59:47,698 --> 01:59:54,359
like something's cool they'll say

2773
01:59:51,118 --> 01:59:56,519
gotcha okay it's not Chiba Chiba I've

2774
01:59:54,359 --> 01:59:58,259
heard in reference to cannabis here

2775
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:00,540
very interesting

2776
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:02,340
so yeah so that doesn't even help pin

2777
02:00:00,539 --> 02:00:05,939
down where the province could have been

2778
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:07,260
in relation to yeah but not I remember I

2779
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:08,759
think I remember the article you're

2780
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:11,400
talking about it was one of those things

2781
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:14,520

2782

2826
02:02:21,238 --> 02:02:24,979
questioning everything I'd ever
