00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,559
explore the history of a clandestine

welcome to breeder Syndicate strain

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,399
reviews today we will be reviewing Santa

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,259
Cruz goat farms Santa Cruz wreck a

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,420
hybrid of Santa Cruz blue dream and

16
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,299
Arcata train wreck first off I should

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,780
start by saying if I had you know a top

18
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,359
10 list of desert island strains Santa

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,640
Cruz Blue Dream cut and Arcata train

20
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,979
wreck would probably be somewhere in

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,799
that list so when I first heard Santa

22
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,839
Cruz goat farm was doing a hybrid of the

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,698
Santa Cruz Blue Dream cut and the Arcata

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,198
train wreck first off I was like how do

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,280
you know you've got the Santa Cruz blue

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,158
dream

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,260
granted he's from Santa Cruz but in many

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,420
many years I haven't seen that exact

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,118
specific cut it's been a long time since

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,740
I've seen it and um but he's pretty

31
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,299
confident he showed me some pictures it

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,819
looks right but a lot of the Santa Cruz

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,200
Blue Dream stuff looks identical but

34
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,539
when you go to smoke it it's way

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,719
different the the scent profiles

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,759
drastically different and the quality of

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,640
the high is is drastically different so

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,959
I'm always skeptical and for one like

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,478
for the first time in years someone

40
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,438
delivered he has the Santa Cruz Blue

41
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,519
Dream he brought me bud of it pure and

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,618
hybrids and all kinds of stuff so some

43
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,539
of that is what I'm reviewing today so

44
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,219
this is the Santa Cruz wreck it's a

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,100
hybrid of Arcata train wreck and the

46
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,500
Santa Cruz Blue Dream cut the Santa Cruz

47
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:56,938
Blue Dream cut was a super silver haze

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,759
and DJ blueberry cut hybrid and it was a

49
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,679
very specific selection and

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,599
um you know the the original Santa Cruz

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,780
blue dream was a little bit of berry a

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,659
little bit of terpenolene and a lot of

53
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,640
complexity almost like dryer sheets all

54
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,500
kinds of weird beautiful notes in there

55
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,539
so I'm going to give this a crack and

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,539
see what we smell upon first crack here

57
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,179
so I yeah

58
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,739
so it has the dryer sheet smell of blue

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,739
dream that I it's what I would call it

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,080
you can definitely smell some Berry you

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,699
can definitely smell a little bit of

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,080
terpinoline because I mean it's a hybrid

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,079
of train wreck and blue dream

64
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,060
not so strong on the lemon in this one

65
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,500
um but this is this is some seriously

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,598
beautiful Bud

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,400
um again it's not like cookies density

68
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,738
but it's still got good density like

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,719
blue dream had uh train wreck usually

70
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,000
brings a little bit of looseness to the

71
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,219
hybrids that it's involved in but it

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,180
really didn't impact the density of this

73
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,419
Bud

74
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,219
um it's very very resinous again train

75
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,659
wreck brings a lot of resin more resin

76
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,878
than people are accustomed to seeing to

77
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,299
and narrow leaf type plants and blue

78
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,859
dream as well Mega resin bomb for a

79
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,560
narrow leaf plant so these two combined

80
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,720
made for uh

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,840
this is

82
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:22,580
this is exceptional like there are so

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,580
many smells deep in this

84
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:29,120
there's like a low cotton candy smell

85
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,979
with the like the best smell like when

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,719
you're standing next to like a wall that

87
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,299
has a dryer and dryer sheets are in it

88
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,818
and it's blowing the air out

89
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,620
with some Berry interpinally it is so

90
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,298
hard to describe it may be one of the

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,700
more complex things that I've tried to

92
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,739
describe on here now so far which there

93
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,139
aren't a lot yet but it's one of the

94
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,360
harder ones I've always had a

95
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,859
time describing blue dream so I'm going

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,980
to break it up now it's breaking up real

97
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,680
nice I don't need a grinder it's still

98
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,859
super sticky like all of Santa Cruz goat

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,360
farms uh weed it's cured super sticky I

100
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,120
believe this is a three month cure on

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,500
this and it is still super sticky it's

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,599
not moist it's not like at risk of you

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,639
know molding or anything it's just

104
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,219
really really resinous and sticky and

105
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,740
cured perfectly it's not it's not like

106
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,080
you know breaking up to dust in my

107
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,620
fingers like a lot of weed does uh

108
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:32,060
that's improperly cured or dried this is

109
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,860
proper [ __ ] so Props to him on the hat

110
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,100
and I'll give you a flavor report here

111
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,860
in one second I forgot it all broken up

112
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,740
but I'm I've I've smoked a little bit of

113
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,100
it before a few days ago

114
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,160
and it's my go-to right now if that says

115
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,840
anything I've I love this drain

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,300
um I'm already growing it we already

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,239
have some popped running in the grow

118
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:01,740
um I I really want this cut of it too

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,720
because this is fire so uh yeah I'll

120
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,259
give it a burn here and see how it

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,259
tastes

122
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,339
it's like an explosion of

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,800
fruit dryer sheets because that dry

124
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,579
sheet taste comes through so well it's a

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,600
beautiful happy like real flavorful it's

126
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,579
not

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,500
soapy

128
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,719
um you can taste the berry on the back

129
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,819
end a little bit lots of it doesn't

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,800
taste as heavy as terpenoline as you

131
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,199
would think for a hybrid of Blue Dream

132
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,600
and train wreck I'm getting a lot of the

133
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,180
fruity

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,560
this is some amazing stuff this is

135
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,418
special

136
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,339
this is special

137
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:59,339
the you know

138
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:02,339
the high again reminds me a lot of um

139
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,918
the silver Pearl from Ohio that pipsweed

140
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,019
brought to the table to our crew and

141
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,079
it's it's it's definitely one of my top

142
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,959
fives as far as I it's just

143
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,019
got the best quality high and this has

144
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,839
that too it's kind of making me chatty a

145
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,399
little obnoxious not feeling tired I'm

146
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,099
not feeling it behind my eyes I'm

147
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,500
feeling it more in my chest and

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,680
um I love that I love a good

149
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,439
clear-headed chatty up what people would

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,780
traditionally call a sativa type high so

151
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,500
yeah this is this is a solid six out of

152
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,659
five

153
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,759
um there's not a lot that I get in Smoke

154
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,280
where I'm just mind blown by it and

155
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,800
where I want more and more and then I

156
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,418
pop it immediately so

157
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,400
um this is one of those rare occasions

158
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,079
where I want to work it into the Bonnet

159
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,899
lines I want to do some stuff with this

160
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,120
uh maybe even more so than just the

161
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,038
straight Santa Cruz blue dream so uh
