71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,819
your your youth you know we're about the

72

same age so you were smoking in the 70s

73
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,039
and and uh and early 80s and and you

74
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,900
were telling your stories about what it

75
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,120
was like

76
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,519
um you know your early days when you

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,620
first got high and you know some

78
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
different experiences and places you

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,700
lived around campus can you tell us a

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,259
little bit about kind of those early

81
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,658
days and

82
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,840
um how you got into weed

83
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:45,000
oh sure uh oh one more thing we've done

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,000
this dude ranch in Colorado when I was

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,340
about 10 years old and uh that was my

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,259
first experience seeing cannabis I

87
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,239
didn't smoke it or get high but I I

88
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,598
noticed it was that they said it was

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,580
even Colombian but uh we had a campfire

90
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,378
everybody was sitting around and they

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,120
were smoking it the older guys and

92
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:04,979
everything and they really had a really

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,459
good experience with it

94
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,798
and of course it was a a few years later

95
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,319
when I actually smoked some and got high

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,360
but uh that was later when I I think it

97
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,699
was a very similar story to like you

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,340
were talking about where after school I

99
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,419
I was riding home on the bus and this uh

100
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,698
guy had some joints for sale and uh

101
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,620
he said it's really really good man I

102
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,960
and and I gave him a dollar bought two

103
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,759
of them it was wrapped in nice pink

104
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,219
rolling papers

105
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,439
and uh when I got out the school bus I

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,940
had like a little Entourage with me you

107
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,300
know that was wanting to see what

108
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:44,399
happened when we smoked it and uh we

109
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,620
went out in the woods and and uh that

110
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,779
was when I first really felt it and

111
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,720
realized this is something I wanted to

112
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:54,659
keep with me in my life Wow

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,780
but it was Mexican the first time we you

114
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,400
know I'm sure you remember him oh I

115
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,039
remember that whole that whole picture

116
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,439
you just painted man I I can I can still

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,379
I can picture the joints you know the

118
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,300
paper looked like it was so thick you

119
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,000
know you couldn't see anything through

120
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,579
it and the ends were probably spun and

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,379
twisted and if if it unspun the whole

122
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,500
thing would just dump out you know

123
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,300
because it was powdery in there and and

124
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,038
the kids I can't even imagine the

125
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,079
excitement of the kids kind of chasing

126
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,538
along trying to find a place to hide in

127
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,939
some bushes or some crap you know as you

128
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:32,038
were you know just the pure innocence of

129
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,259
of that introduction moment and

130
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,300
everything it's it's great Rider I I

131
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,520
love the story and I think we all

132
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,020
identify with that oh yeah that's very

133
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,219
familiar going with your friends and

134
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,599
everybody waiting to see who's gonna

135
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,139
smoke it first and who's gonna have the

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,639
first reaction yeah yeah and of course I

137
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,800
guess that first time around the

138
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,319
campfire did you actually smoke with

139
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,960
those older dudes and not experience not

140
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,360
get high or was it you watched them do

141
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,939
it and thought Oh this is okay maybe

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,580
I'll someday later you tried it

143
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,918
well actually that was a this is a ghost

144
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,198
story we we were camping up in the

145
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,740
mountains in Colorado in between Vail

146
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,259
and uh Steamboat Springs and we were we

147
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,699
were probably at 12 000 feet way up on

148
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,780
top of this mountain

149
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,939
and uh I I I I just watched them smoke a

150
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,818
little bit of it but in the morning my

151
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,860
cousin who was a little bit older than I

152
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,660
uh told me oh man there were ghosts last

153
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,819
night but didn't you hear all the horses

154
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,740
and all the Indians and everything and I

155
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,100
I looked at him no man I didn't remember

156
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,960
any of that wow but apparently they woke

157
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,680
up in the middle of the night hearing

158
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:43,258
horses stampeding through the little uh

159
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,120
Valley we were in and it just got louder

160
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,580
and louder and louder and no nothing

161
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,899
appeared and it scared the [ __ ] out all

162
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,478
these guys

163
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,758
but uh I didn't hear any of it I only

164
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,560

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,979

Colombian weed and the country of

183
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,258

193
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,060
that

194
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,859
um that Colombian weed you were saying

195
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,598
what what year was this yes the first

196
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,280
time you smoked you didn't well let me

197
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,379
tell you about the first time and I I

198
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:08,339
left out an important character and that

199
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:11,159
was Becky Becky was a 16 year old this

200
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,198
was the last day of school and she when

201
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,099
she found out I had the marijuana when I

202
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,160
had the two joints uh her her

203
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:22,740
her disposition to me changed and she

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,860
became very attentive and I was I I

205
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,759
suddenly realized that man this weed

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,580
really gets her excited you know

207
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,759
so we we walked down towards the lake

208
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,940
with a little group of uh smaller

209
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,038
children following us and uh as we got

210
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,080
to a certain place we lit up the joint

211
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,019
and when I I noticed when we lit the

212
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,899
joint all the little kids were gone

213
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,879
but I I gave it to her she took a couple

214
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,039
big hits and she grabbed my arm and said

215
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,860
hey come here and she put the joint in

216
00:08:53,039 --> 00:09:00,719
her mouth you know for a shotgun yeah

217
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,539
and gave me a big shotgun kiss yeah and

218
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,459
I felt it man I mean I that [ __ ] that

219
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,740
was the first hit of that joint but man

220
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:10,319
I felt it right away

221
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,778
and we smoke the rest of that joint and

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,320
we walked down to the I was high as hell

223
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:19,080
everything was just incredibly it was

224
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,660
afternoon the sun was out birds were out

225
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,240
we walked to this really secluded part

226
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,278
of the lake and she just took her

227
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,100
clothes off and went into the water

228
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,799
and I was as women tend to do around all

229
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,778
of us and I I didn't even know I didn't

230
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,299
I should have jumped on that but I

231
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:37,980
didn't I was just too much in wow she

232
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,219
said come on in so I went into my

233
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,220
clothes

234
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,300
that shotgun that shotgun kiss is like

235
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,579
was like the sexiest thing

236
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,559
ever yeah right combining your two

237
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,480
favorite things in the world

238
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,559
right up it was a good way to get a girl

239
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,320
to kiss you too you know yeah well she

240
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,419
and she did it it was even better you

241
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,839
know yeah yeah but uh all right so then

242
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:09,360
she goes she's in the water

243
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,160
but I never told her I had another joint

244
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,560
and I kept that other one I went back

245
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,360
home and I ate and I was with my parents

246
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,119
and everything and I thought man I still

247
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,060
have a whole another joint of that

248
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,519
so I turned on my best friend he's like

249
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:27,899
my friend of 40 years

250
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,700
50 now and uh after that we started uh

251
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,860
trying to grow it

252
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,440
you know from all the seeds and we never

253
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,259
really got any plants but but that

254
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,899
started the the my quest where I would

255
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,299
divide by every week I was working then

256
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,059
I was 13 that I had a job

257
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,939
and every week when I got paid I'd go to

258
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:50,399
the Yamaha dealership and uh the

259
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,100
mechanic would sell me a nice lid of

260
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,379
Mexican you know nice

261
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,899
it was a great summer

262
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:00,360
yeah yeah we we rode dirt bikes all

263
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,278
summer down by this Lake and uh we just

264
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,320
get high I met some other guys that got

265
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,379
me high down there with some really good

266
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,600
like tie stick wow

267
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,700
but you know I already knew there was

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,220
really good weed around uh even though

269
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,459
all I could buy was you know [ __ ] weed

270
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,639
but we were reading High Times yeah and

271
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,559
the high times but to me High Times was

272
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,838
like a penthouse you know it's like I

273
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,719
knew it existed but it wasn't what I was

274
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,279
getting very much yeah yeah they were

275
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,940
yeah

276
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,939
yeah

277
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,159
go ahead

278
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,479
oh I was just I was just thinking you

279
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,179
know that um

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,100
that's my exact same experience I I had

281
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,139
a very good friend

282
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,360
um you know through high school as I was

283
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,939
doing all this stuff at you know side by

284
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,860
side we were we were we were a real

285
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,779
parent sounds like you had that that

286
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,700
same experience I'm sure that's pretty

287
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,620
common you know I think it's just so

288
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,140
refreshing to get people to come on now

289
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,179
who have been you know chasing this this

290
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:07,919
thing for so long and who who admit when

291
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:12,179
they weren't a huge OG OG baller and

292
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:14,399
when things went wrong and how it was it

293
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,399
they didn't start off you know with a

294
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,039
hundred acres of you know of of stuff

295
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,639
they they started off with three plants

296
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:26,399
in a shadow and um

297
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,338
you know and it changed everything right

298
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,799
so I think I think you

299
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,839
um you know that Honesty makes it just

300
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,699
so refreshing compared to I mean look

301
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,339
there are people out there who have done

302
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,560
big big big stuff and I respect them I

303
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,360
know it's real love hearing the stories

304
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,979
but there's also people out there

305
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,259
fronting that they're they're more than

306
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,019
and were more than what they really were

307
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:52,139
and I just like I like the honesty right

308
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:55,440
I guess so uh please continue

309
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,480
one check and what happened was uh the

310
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,160
other I went I took them to my parents

311
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,120
house we weren't there my parents

312
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,439

313
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,539
there and I tried to get them to come in

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,459
to listen to some music and they said

315
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:09,299
nah it looked a little dangerous in the

316
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:11,578
house and but the Colombian girl Uchi

317
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,159
Uchi uh she said yeah I'll go in with

318
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:17,278
you and one thing led to another and I

319
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:20,399
started seeing her by herself

320
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,458

324
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,620

330
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,419
like hey whoa that's my job yeah what

331
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,759
but between her lovely cleavage she

332
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:53,819
pulled out a joint man and she said now

333
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,399
this is good weed and she lit that [ __ ]

334
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,300
up and that's when I really had some

335
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,539
good good connoisseur Colombian

336
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:05,338
but also fell in love with her you know

337
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,759
I mean it was kind of a combination

338
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,920
thing there yeah I bet

339
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,740
oh yeah then I I had to know more about

340
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,778
Colombia I I but she left she was there

341
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,459
for three weeks and went back to

342
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:19,500
Columbia and never heard from her again

343
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,219
oh man

344
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,710
that is the best Colombian love story

345
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,379
ever right

346
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,379
[Laughter]

347
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,339
red red red that is the best Colombian

348
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:40,198
love story ever oh my gosh so awesome

349
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:43,620
wow wow oh it goes

350
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,599
what happened after that yeah we didn't

351
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,839
get all of the American part of this

352
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,540
story yet did we no this was the the

353
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,360
first time I got high and I don't know

354
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:57,419
why but I'd smoked it before I mean I'd

355
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,459
smoked weed before yeah yeah but I think

356
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,198
that's common for a lot of us like the

357
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,759
first time we do we smoke we don't quite

358
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,799
know what to or what we're gonna

359
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,419
experience we don't know how much to

360
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,338
smoke we don't really maybe you

361
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,139
sometimes don't know how how to inhale

362
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,639
correctly at that point depending on if

363
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,100
we smoke cigarettes or Not by that age

364
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,480
and I think it's our brain just doesn't

365
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,459
know how to process it so we don't

366
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,778
understand the high so like it takes

367
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,599
three or four times to where you're like

368
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:24,059
ah this is comfortable you know yeah

369
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,459
then you you know what to expect yeah

370
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,018
exactly that's great you know when the

371
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,539
boys in the lab coach start talking

372
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:33,060
about

373
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:34,458
cannabinoid receptors you know yeah you

374
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,518
know that from the end the

375
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:40,619
endocannabinoid system you think about

376
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,860
the first time you flood those things

377
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,019
with an external cannabinoid it's really

378
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,759
cool because you know may who knows

379
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,679
maybe maybe like the first time you do

380
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,480
that it's like whoa you know your

381
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,578
cannabinoids are all

382
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,899
yeah

383
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:57,359
personalizing them right there's you

384
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,698
know whoa you know they're really

385
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,139
reacting to this flood of cannabinoids

386
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,799
they don't know what to do with it maybe

387
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,139
they shut down yeah the first time right

388
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,338
maybe or blocking or something I don't

389
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,440
know I'm just throwing this [ __ ] out

390
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,660
there man that stuff we were smoking had

391
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,480
been through hell before it got to us so

392
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:18,000
so have you uh writer have you heard of

393
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,139
something called CHS out there

394
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,659
um can that I think it's cannabinoid

395
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:27,180
hyperemesis syndrome

396
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:28,259
no it's fairly new and

397
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,159
um it's something that they've been

398
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:36,120
pushing like so I I've both my brother

399
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:38,039
uh or and my cousin have gone to the ER

400
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,560
recently with some cyclic vomiting kind

401
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,620
of like I have too like and

402
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,278
they the nurses keep pushing this idea

403
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,899
that it's from something called CHS

404
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,578
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome so it's

405
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,440
something and I started doing research

406
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,419
into it and one of my good friends is an

407
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,699
ER doctor and he's a he's a smoker too

408
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:58,139
so he's been really researching this

409
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,479
because he started having similar

410
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,459
symptoms and from what they can tell

411
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,620
early on the research thought they

412
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,480
thought maybe it's from crops sprayed

413
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,338
with neem oil yeah

414
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,838
um but they're not sure if that really

415
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,058
is the case they're not sure if it's

416
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,619
from you know heavy use of extracts

417
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:15,599
since a lot of people randomly use

418
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,938
extracts with flour and and it's just

419
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,918
too much for our systems but whatever it

420
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,400
is it's inducing

421
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,220
um uh cyclical vomiting in people just

422
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,500
like day after day after day of endless

423
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,819
puking in people but they just don't

424
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
know why and and they call it

425
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,539
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome but

426
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,759
realistically it could be related to

427
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:38,519
terpenes it could be related to an

428
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,279
unknown or an untested for cannabinoid

429
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,259
you know not THC but it could be you

430
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,579
know God knows what else but yeah it's

431
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:46,619
an interesting one that's going to be

432
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:49,980
popping up more and more

433
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,259
yeah maybe the presence of uh of foreign

434
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,240
stuff and concentrates I mean none of

435
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:58,940
this really happened until there was uh

436
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,940
a legal Market yeah

437
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,740
um there's a lot of causation you know

438
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,620
um correlation causation type stuff yeah

439
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,380
stuff yeah probably going on but you

440
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,178
know I I did you uh talk to any of your

441
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,520
family about the

442
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,700
ory I talked with you about about the

443
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,940
effects of breathing superheated [ __ ]

444
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,140
from uh butane torches no

445
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,919
um so

446
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,280
neither of them do that but they they

447
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,740
both are very heavy uh like Vape

448
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,178
cartridge users

449
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,460
like the carts like the isolate cart

450
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,620
[ __ ] you know remember the guy that that

451
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,440
used to measure that used to measure

452
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:43,339
this Mystery Oil and all the available

453
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,900
butane on the market yes

454
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:47,099
that guy yeah

455
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,759
um yeah

456
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:52,379
ah who knows man yeah I did I get

457
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,900
frustrated with science these days

458
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,419
because they all have these other

459
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,000
agendas you know it's just like where's

460
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,700
the money coming from well then I moved

461
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,919
to Florida because my father my

462
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,058
stepmother lived in in West Palm Beach

463
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:11,220
and uh that's where I I had that Dan the

464
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,980
painter Man story uh that's where the

465
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,380
guy he was a drug dealer lived right

466
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,019
upstairs and he was getting all these

467
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,940
fantastic Imports coming through South

468
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,700
uh Florida at the time

469
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,798
and in fact that's when I first saw the

470
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,440
the first indica

471
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,960
oh wow what year

472
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,380
uh that was that was actually the spring

473
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,019
of 1980. oh nice perfect

474
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,539
and I didn't know it was Indica uh as a

475
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:42,119
matter of fact uh I I only read about

476
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,500
indica and High Times I I really didn't

477
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,899
know what it was

478
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,259
and uh I did grow plants I started

479
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,600
growing plants in Texas in uh late 70s

480
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:54,298
but I didn't know how to do it

481
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,579
I didn't know how to flower them or

482
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,319
anything like that is that why you moved

483
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:01,579
to Columbia because they just do you

484
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,500
can't mess it up woman and uh

485
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:07,379
in

486
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,380
2002 uh February January nothing too met

487
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,140
her online you know I met her online

488
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,000
had a night I I thought man I wanna I

489
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,400
wanna find a woman you know I want to

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,440

491
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,360
should I find where what what woman

492
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,798
would I want so I started looking in

493
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,599

566
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,280

567
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:44,339

568

572
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,120

573

587
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,919
so I we had changed hotels to the Hilton

588
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,678
for some reason I got a really good rate

589
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,580
on this beautiful incredible room

590
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:46,320
overlooking the Lagoon in uh Cartagena

591
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:48,298
and I wanted to roll that [ __ ] up first

592
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,399
thing I did was I went out on the

593
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:52,798
balcony and got my papers and started

594
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
breaking it down and I looked around and

595
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,599
I thought where the where the hell is

596
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,000
she at and she went in the bathroom and

597
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,619
locked the door

598
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,980
and I was like don't worry don't worry

599
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:08,099
you know I I lift that up and I got high

600
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,220
as hell and I knocked on the door and I

601
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:13,439
was like hey hey and uh she said what

602
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,900
she opened up the door and I stand in

603
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
there with an erection from hell man I

604
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,500
mean

605
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,740
this does this to you

606
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,140
but it was a beautiful romantic

607
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,740
experience with the Colombian again

608
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,740
again

609
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,940
she locked the door was she so was she

610
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,500
scared of like the consequences of

611
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,940
someone might smell it and the cops

612
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,798
coming or

613
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,860
no she was afraid it was going to make

614
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,079
me go crazy because they they don't

615
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:45,418
think of drugs like we do they they

616
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,399
really don't this is a Naruto State and

617
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,500
the normal people the regular people

618
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,500
don't they don't [ __ ] with drugs they

619
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,200
just don't do it yeah yeah no alcoholics

620
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,019
you know you like drenching come here

621
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,480
they drink more than Germans yeah

622
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:03,480
you know we have 22 holidays a year 22.

623
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:10,140
you have five in the United States yeah

624
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:13,799
so they're always is always a festival a

625
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:17,400
party or a reason to get drunk yeah it

626
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:20,278
makes sense but don't smoke no weed

627
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Narco states are weird man and and it

628
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,400
makes sense though because of the

629
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,199
propaganda that the U.S had pushed down

630
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,200
they're so hard and and

631
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:33,240
yeah for sure it's uh it's interesting

632
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,460
though because you know by the by the

633
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,240
80s I think most people

634
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,980
in the country kind of realized it was

635
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,159
not true

636
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,558
right yeah but first there are huge

637
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,980
parts of the population who just bought

638
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,019
it hook line and sinker and uh you know

639
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,700
they just bought it and they passed it

640
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:57,480
down to their children and just repeated

641
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,580
its myths and it's uh very powerful I

642
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,440
mean that much she must she was scared

643
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,199
right she was legitimately scared you

644
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,720
were gonna come back and be like the

645
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,100
crazy guy from playing the piano and

646
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,339
Reefer Madness you know yeah

647
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:17,579
while we're while we're here in um in

648
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:21,418
like the the DEA propaganda territory

649
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:22,678
why don't we cover some of the uh Parts

650
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,320
about

651
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,419
the perceptions of Colombia and the

652
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,939
dangerous Parts like how dangerous it is

653
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:32,400
or isn't to go there and the perception

654
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,259
from America and that and your your

655
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,600
fears when you first went there what

656
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,400
were your concerns you know uh when I

657
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,278
was doing a lot of traveling in South

658
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,519
America in the 90s Colombia was the one

659
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,900
place I didn't go because it was so

660
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,658
sketchy then

661
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,519
right now it seems like very comfortable

662
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,140
and nice and there's all kinds of travel

663
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,900
in and out

664
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,380
um but it was by far the most violent

665
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:02,100
and sketchy place you know in the 90s at

666
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,320
least in the 90s was Pablo Escobar yeah

667
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:06,658

00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,278
on business and stuff so you know now

670
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,278

671
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,900
because uh Colombia was trashed and now

672
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,819
it's reversed like nobody goes to

673

Venezuela and Colombia is like super

674
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:22,980

675

I I've worked here I've lived in the

704
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,899
worst Barrios in Bogota

705
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,079
so I mean this is the red light zone

706
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:39,658
where it's very cheap prostitutes really

707
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,460
a bad area yeah and I never had a

708
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,679
problem because I was just very

709
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,659
conscious of what was going on around me

710
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,899
and never had anything to steal yeah

711

that's a value is weed and here weed

713
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,538
doesn't have very much value but to me

714
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:01,158
it's worth more than money sure

715
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:06,240

top opened it up in just an incredible

823
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,579
it makes sense for smell to hide the

824
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,858
smell everything smart who was teasing

825
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,619

826
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:58,858
pull it away oh wait look no no

827

body yep yep

829
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,519
let's start talking about that that

830
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,260
um that Colombian weed you were saying

831
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,000
what what year was this yes the first

832
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,619
time you smoked you didn't well let me

833
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,719
tell you about the first time and I I

834
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:19,680
left out an important character and that

835
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:22,500
was Becky Becky was a 16 year old this

836
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,539
was the last day of school and she when

837
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,760
she found out I had the marijuana when I

838
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:31,800
had the two joints uh her her her

839
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,500
disposition to me changed and she became

840
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,460
very attentive and I was I I suddenly

841
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,980
realized that man this weed really gets

842
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,980
her excited you know

843
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,099
so we we walked down towards the lake

844
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,920
with a little group of

845
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:52,019
smaller children following us and uh as

846
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,300
we got to a certain place we lit up the

847
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:57,300
joint and when I I noticed when we lit

848
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:00,240
the joint all the little kids were gone

849
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,220
but I I gave it to her she took a couple

850
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,379
big hits and she grabbed my arm and said

851
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:07,199
hey come here and she put the joint in

852
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:12,059
her mouth you know for a shotgun yeah

853
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:14,819
and gave me a big shotgun kiss yeah and

854
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,739
I felt it man I mean I that [ __ ] that

855
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,140
was the first hit of that joint but man

856
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:21,598
I felt it right away

857
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:24,059
and we smoked the rest of that joint and

858
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,660
we walked down to the I was high as hell

859
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:30,420
everything was just incredibly it was

860
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:33,059
afternoon the sun was out birds were out

861
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,579
we walked to this really secluded part

862
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,619
of the lake and she just took her

863
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:40,560
clothes off and went into the water

864
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,180
and I was as women tend to do around all

865
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,920
of us

866
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,139
actually no I didn't I should have

867
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,720
jumped on that but I I didn't I was just

868
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:51,358
too much in wow she said come on in so I

869
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,299
went into my clothes

870
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,639
but it was an excellent

871
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,640
that shotgun that shotgun kiss is like

872
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,920
was like the sexiest thing

873
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:05,059
ever yeah right combining your two

874
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,059
favorite things in the world

875
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,760
she's in the water

876
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,500
but I never told her I had another joint

877
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,960
and I kept that other one I went back

878
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,699
home and I ate and I was with my parents

879
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,519
and everything and I thought man I still

880
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:32,338
have a whole another joint of that

881
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,920
so I turned on my best friend he's like

882
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:38,880
my friend of 40 years

883
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,980
50 now and uh after that we started

884
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,140
trying to grow it

885
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,780
you know from all the seeds and we never

886
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:48,598
really got any plants but but that

887
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,240
started the the my quest where I would

888
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,579
divide by every week I was working then

889
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,219
I was 13 but I had a job

890
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:59,280
and every week when I got paid I'd go

891
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:01,739
over to the Yamaha dealership and uh the

892
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,380
mechanic would sell me a nice lid of

893
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:06,659
Mexican you know nice

894
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,000
it was a great summer

895
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,639
yeah yeah we we rode dirt bikes all

896
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,619
summer down by this Lake and uh we just

897
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,659
get high I met some other guys that got

898
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,720
me high down there with some really good

899
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:20,940
like Thai stick wow

900
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,039
but you know I already knew there was

901
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,619
really good weed around uh even though

902
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,800
all I could buy was you know [ __ ] weed

903
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,980
but we were reading High Times yeah and

904
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,900
the high times but to me High Times was

905
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,179
like a penthouse you know it's like I

906
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,059
knew it existed but it wasn't what I was

907
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,559
getting very much yeah yeah they were

908
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,219
yeah

909
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,219
yeah

910
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,500
go ahead

911
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,820
oh I was just I was just thinking you

912
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,460
know that um

913
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,380
that's my exact same experience I I had

914
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,420
a very good friend

915
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,700
um you know through high school as I was

916
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,280
doing all this stuff at you know side by

917
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:01,199
side we were we were we were a real

918
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,119
parent it sounds like you had that that

919
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,039
same experience I'm sure that's pretty

920
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,960
common you know I think it's just so

921
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,480
refreshing to get people to come on now

922
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,519
who have been you know chasing this this

923
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:19,199
thing for so long and who who admit when

924
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:23,519
they weren't a huge OG OG baller and

925
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,739
when things went wrong and how it was it

926
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,679
they didn't start off you know with a

927
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:31,319
hundred acres of you know of of stuff

928
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:34,980
they they started off with three plants

929
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,740
in a shadow and um

930
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,619
you know and it changed everything right

931
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:43,078
so I think I think you

932
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:45,180
um you know that Honesty makes it just

933
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:47,039
so refreshing compared to I mean look

934
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:49,679
there are people out there who have done

935
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,900
big big big stuff and I respect them I

936
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,699
know it's real love hearing the stories

937
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,320
but there's also people out there

938
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,598
fronting that they're they're more than

939
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,480
and were more than what they really were

940
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,079
and I just like I like the honesty red I

941
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,119
guess so uh please continue yeah we we

942
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,060
didn't get all of the American part of

943
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:11,880
this story yet did we now this was the

944
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:13,980
the first time I got high and and I

945
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,039
don't know why but I'd smoked it before

946
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,079
I mean I'd smoked weed before yeah yeah

947
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,358
but I think that's common for a lot of

948
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,220
us like the first time we do we smoke we

949
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,139
don't quite know what to or what we're

950
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:27,419
gonna experience we don't know how much

951
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:29,460
to smoke we don't really maybe sometimes

952
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,019
don't know how how to inhale correctly

953
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,179
at that point depending on if we smoke

954
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:34,858
cigarettes or Not by that age and I

955
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,358
think it's our brain just doesn't know

956
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,578
how to process it so we don't understand

957
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,019
the high so like it takes three or four

958
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,780
times to where you're like ah this is

959
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:45,900
comfortable you know yeah then you you

960
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,700
know what to expect yeah exactly that's

961
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,059
great you know when the boys in the lab

962
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:53,578
coach start talking about

963
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:55,019
cannabinoid receptors you know yeah you

964
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,300
know that from the end the

965
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:00,358
endocannabinoid system and

966
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,900
um you think about the first time you

967
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,819
flood those things with an external

968
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,680
cannabinoid it's really cool because you

969
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,720
know may who knows maybe maybe like the

970
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:13,159
first time you do that it's like whoa

971
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:15,480
you know I hear Canada noise girl yeah

972
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:17,879
personalizing them right there's you

973
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,280
know whoa you know they're really

974
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,720
reacting to this flood of cannabinoids

975
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,380
they don't know what to do with it maybe

976
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:27,719
they shut down yeah the first time right

977
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,920
maybe or blocking or something I don't

978
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,019
know I'm just throwing this [ __ ] out

979
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,240
there man that stuff we were smoking had

980
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:36,059
been through hell before it got to us so

981
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:38,578

something called CHS out there

983
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:44,240
um can that I think it's cannabinoid

984
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,759
hyperemesis syndrome

985
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,899
no it's fairly new and

986
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,800
um it's something that they've been

987
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:56,760
pushing like so I I've both my brother

988
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,619
uh or and my cousin have gone to the ER

989
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,140
recently with some cyclic vomiting kind

990
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,200
of like I have too like and

991
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:06,858
they the nurses keep pushing this idea

992
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:09,480
that it's from something called CHS

993
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:11,159
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome so it's

994
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,019
something and I started doing research

995
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,000
into it and one of my good friends is an

996
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,280
ER doctor and he's a he's a smoker too

997
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,719
so he's been really researching this

998
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,060
because he started having similar

999
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,980
symptoms and from what they can tell

1000
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:25,199
early on the research thought they

1001
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,059
thought maybe it's from crops sprayed

1002
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,919
with neem oil yeah

1003
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:30,420
um but they're not sure if that really

1004
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,639
is the case they're not sure if it's

1005
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,139
from you know heavy use of extracts

1006
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,179
since a lot of people randomly use

1007
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:38,519
extracts with flour and and it's just

1008
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,500
too much for our systems but whatever it

1009
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,980
is it's inducing

1010
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,800
um uh cyclical vomiting in people just

1011
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,079
like day after day after day of endless

1012
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
puking in people but they just don't

1013
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,079
know why and and they call it

1014
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,119
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome but

1015
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,339
realistically it could be related to

1016
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,099
terpenes it could be related to an

1017
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,858
unknown or an untested for cannabinoid

1018
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,838
you know not THC but it could be you

1019
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:05,159
know God knows what else but yeah it's

1020
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,199
an interesting one that's going to be

1021
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,559
popping up more and more

1022
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,838
yeah maybe the presence of uh of foreign

1023
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,818
stuff and concentrates I mean none of

1024
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:19,519
this really happened until there was uh

1025
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:19,519
a legal Market yeah

1026
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,318
um there's a lot of causation you know

1027
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,200
um correlation causation type stuff yeah

1028
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:30,960
stuff yeah probably going on but you

1029
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:32,818
know I I did you uh talk to any of your

1030
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,159
family about the

1031
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:38,338
ory I talked with you about about the

1032
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:41,578
effects of breathing superheated [ __ ]

1033
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:42,779
from uh butane torches no

1034
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,560
um so

1035
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:49,920
neither of them do that but they they

1036
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:53,219
both are very heavy uh like Vape

1037
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,200
cartridge users like the carts like the

1038
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:57,659
isolate cart [ __ ] you know remember the

1039
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,899
guy that that used to measure that used

1040
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:03,980
to measure this Mystery Oil and all the

1041
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,539
available butane on the market yes

1042
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,679
that guy yeah

1043
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:11,338
um yeah

1044
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,960
ah who knows man yeah I did I get

1045
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:15,480
frustrated with science these days

1046
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,000
because they all have these other

1047
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,380
agendas you know it's just like where's

1048
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the money coming from since you're

1049
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,960
familiar with all the Mexicans and

1050
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,059
everything dude when you uh that Maui

1051
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,760
um the can of Maui did it did it remind

1052
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:33,539
you were there any Mexican traits to the

1053
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,480
any any similarity at all uh no I never

1054
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:40,858
had cannabis like that before or since

1055
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,139
it had a a real flowery you could feel

1056
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:46,619
the islands in it you could feel that

1057
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:48,960
tropical sunshine when you hit it I

1058
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,818
didn't get very much he he I couldn't

1059
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,500
buy it it was too expensive but I would

1060
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:54,480
just kind of hang around when other

1061
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,480
people would buy it so I could taste it

1062
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,039
yeah right yeah but uh yeah that and

1063
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,599
there was there was other ones that was

1064
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,400
right about when we started seeing

1065
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,640
indica and everybody was really

1066
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,358
impressed oh it tastes like black hash

1067
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:12,118
and yeah it was a real narcotic High yep

1068
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,039
but uh all I could really afford was the

1069
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,079
Mexicans now there were good Mexicans

1070
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:18,480
but most of them were

1071
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,539
I don't know why they imported it really

1072
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,838
I yeah it was a transition period you

1073
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:27,000
know while markets were shaken out

1074
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:29,460
um but you know that Colombo that we

1075
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,739
used to get imported hell man half of

1076
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,539
that stuff was seeds is I was thinking

1077
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:35,459
about what we used to do with that stuff

1078
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:38,099
you know people would just throw

1079
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,380
handfuls of that fresh Colombian seed

1080
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:44,400
out in their yard and just have big

1081
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:46,440
porch yeah yeah I mean it seemed like

1082
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,079
half the weight that got imported was

1083
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,139
seed and how tragic it was that we just

1084
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,220
you know

1085
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:54,239
yeah that's interesting what you just

1086
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:55,679
said about

1087
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,199
um you know you were talking about how

1088
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,299
uplifting and clear the Awaken was and

1089
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:02,279
and and that you know the way you said

1090
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,260
it that you know you know the Colombian

1091
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,900
just wasn't like that it was

1092
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,940
you know people don't realize that yeah

1093
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,280
it was uh it was uh you know it was

1094
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,500
groggy it was the way it felt a lot of

1095
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,019
times is that a good word for it yeah

1096
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,960
but some of the real high quality the

1097
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:21,838
goals were spiritual man and some of the

1098
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,880
red butt was really really good but

1099
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,880
dirty a little dirty at the end

1100
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,400
and if all you ever smoked was the was

1101
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:35,400
the the low end stuff you wouldn't

1102
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,019
recognize you know if it that it had

1103
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,358
some of that same stuff that the

1104
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,300
high-end had in it but it was just kind

1105
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,059
of buried under a layer of just you know

1106
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,780
bad handling and and you know it

1107
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:51,480
probably harsh yeah yeah it was yeah it

1108
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,060
was just crap you know but it had it was

1109
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,039
still there but you had it's to even

1110
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:58,920
recognize that you had to have had the

1111
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:01,679
good stuff at some point say Oh that's

1112
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,619
oh it's in there you know anyway sorry

1113
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:07,980
I'm sidetracking no that's that's fine I

1114
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:11,240
remember uh uh right when uh I can't

1115
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:14,760
this is 1980 uh I joined the military

1116
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:16,199
eventually but before that I I went I

1117
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,380
went back to Texas

1118
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:22,139
and I I my bro my cousin had this friend

1119
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,140
named Jay that was kind of a jock kind

1120
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:27,900
of a sports guy and he needed somebody

1121
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:31,980
to ride with him from Dallas to uh

1122
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,780
Houston to pick up some uh Panama Red he

1123
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:37,260
said it was supposed to be real Panama

1124
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:39,540
Red and of course I jumped on it man I

1125
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,819
wanted to ride with him and and we shot

1126
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:45,059
right down to Baytown and and I remember

1127
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:48,358
he he went into this real uh

1128
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:51,659
real rough barn and Tugboat and it's

1129
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:54,358
like a biker bar man and people getting

1130
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:56,639
shot in there and everything but well he

1131
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:59,519
bought the pound and we we cruised on

1132
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,318
back to Dallas and uh like I said I

1133
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,599
don't know if it was really Panama Red

1134
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:06,420
it seemed to me like it was just real

1135
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,359
good Colombian red

1136
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,639
but he was selling it back then that he

1137
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,980
was selling that for a hundred uh an

1138
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,980
ounce you know it seems like the red

1139
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,780
maybe the red was all biker controlled

1140
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,139
or something

1141
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,960
I mean I I don't know

1142
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:30,059
I got more stories my my older brother

1143
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,880
was a wholesale dealer in 78 and he was

1144
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:34,559
bringing in

1145
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,318
truckloads of the Mexican [ __ ] we you

1146
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,358
know the brick stuff but he also had a

1147
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:41,699
private stash and this is where I first

1148
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:44,880
saw California Cincinnati

1149
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:47,460
and I saw a really good gold really good

1150
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,240
Colombians this was the top of the line

1151
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,039
that you could get and uh I remember one

1152
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,139
time I asked him I said man which is

1153
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,019
what is this sense of age of what is

1154
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:59,940
this stuff and he said it's it's primo

1155
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:02,099
and he said but this is better and he

1156
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,139
had some Colombian red butt and this

1157
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:07,200
stuff would make you feel

1158
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:11,039
I can't describe it it just made Fix You

1159
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:14,219
healed your body healed your mind and it

1160
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:16,199
was really clean really clean uh you

1161
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:18,539
know secondary and everything

1162
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:21,779
of course I also found out about cocaine

1163
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:24,838
from him too that was also really clean

1164
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,000
really pure yeah well he didn't know

1165
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:28,500
about it I one morning I got up for

1166
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,358
school and I opened up the refrigerator

1167
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,659
and all these little envelopes fall

1168
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:35,519
under the floor

1169
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:38,219
what is this man and I poured one out we

1170
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,259
had a big glass kitchen table and I

1171
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:41,939
poured it on the table and I said what

1172
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,900
is this next thing you know I go to

1173
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,200
school

1174
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,480
and my friend this girl that I wasn't

1175
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:51,179
romantic with but I guess she thought

1176
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,838
that she saw that she said we're not

1177
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:56,759
going to school today come on

1178
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,119
we sniffed it all day but that was a she

1179
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,640
knew what to do with it huh

1180
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:05,760
unfortunately my brother got busted uh

1181
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,679
there for uh not for he didn't have any

1182
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,339
drugs but the guy that he was running

1183
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:13,739
around with uh new and undercover cop

1184
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:14,818
and they were going to rob him my

1185
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:16,618
brother didn't know it my brother

1186
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:20,279
thought he was going to really make a

1187
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:22,920
sale and when they went to meet the cop

1188
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,380
the the friend of my brother pulled out

1189
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,780
a pistol and killed him oh my goodness

1190
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,818
and the woods were all wired with police

1191
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:33,540
and I didn't see my brother for about

1192
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:36,119
five years after that wow except for my

1193
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:38,579
brother who was he was like a rock star

1194
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:44,280
he thought he was like a rock star and

1195
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:45,780
yeah he he would say all right 82 82 was

1196
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,420
what yeah

1197
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:52,019
yeah well see I was in Europe right when

1198
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:55,559
uh the last of the great uh import hash

1199
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:58,139
you know the afghanis the patches uh

1200
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:59,579
Lebanese we used to get red Lebanese

1201
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:03,058
that was like

1202
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:04,380
gum like big red gum it was soft and you

1203
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,140
could bend it

1204
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:10,380
it was just we called it choking red it

1205
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:12,358
would light your lungs up yeah Didn't

1206
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,338
They there was rumors it was mixed with

1207
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,098
gum arabic

1208
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:18,659
oh interesting yeah interesting yeah

1209
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:20,940
that would let your lungs up wouldn't it

1210
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:23,519
it was real soft

1211
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,980
yeah it could well but it could also get

1212
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,539
hard as a rock too I mean if you got it

1213
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,119
soft and you were getting good stuff

1214
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:31,800
everything we got of that Lebanese and

1215
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,500
that was pretty much all that was around

1216
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,660
where we were it was hard as a rock and

1217
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,119
it barely got you high and it was so it

1218
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:42,598
might have had CBD in it I mean the

1219
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:46,619
black but no no but Lebanese red it was

1220
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,180
like golden red my experience is that

1221
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:52,260
um or from everything I've been able to

1222
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:56,279
gather is that like Europe got the far

1223
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:59,220
better hash Canada got some Sometimes

1224
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,800
some relatively decent hash and the

1225
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:04,618
United States and the United States got

1226
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,960
the got the [ __ ] that stuck to your shoe

1227
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,940
yeah they got the C grade and the D

1228
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,920
grade everything that they couldn't sell

1229
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,480
in Canada and Europe they were like

1230
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,338
we'll send to America because they'll

1231
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,500
take anything

1232
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:18,299
um so maybe you could talk about that

1233
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,619
for a second so you were in when you

1234
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,200
were in Europe when you were stationed

1235
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:24,119
in Europe you got to experience a bunch

1236
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:25,439
of of hashish

1237
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,019
oh yes

1238
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,079
uh I was stationed in a infantry

1239
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:34,079
battalion in baumholder that was West

1240
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,760
Germany then and uh I mean we were

1241
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,980
always out in the field I was in the

1242
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,220
Infantry so we were always camping out

1243
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,740
and all this [ __ ] but uh we would get uh

1244
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:47,459
what they call a plate a plate was about

1245
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:50,519
200 and it was a hundred grams

1246
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,619
and or we get a piece and a peace would

1247
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:55,079
be twenty dollars but it could be one

1248
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,240
gram or three grams

1249
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,339
and this was all in the barracks you

1250
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:02,279
know this is all with our service guys

1251
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:05,578
no Germans or anything no you're no

1252
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,579
urine tests for cannabis back then right

1253
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,660
pardon me no urine tests for cannabis

1254
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:12,300
back then

1255
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,338
no but that's when they started and

1256
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,440
that's when you know I

1257
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:19,460
I found out then that the military

1258
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,858
frowned on this Behavior

1259
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:26,480
had you told me was that not right was

1260
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:26,480
did I do something wrong

1261
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,559
and it was like

1262
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:33,960
because nobody's seen weed there none of

1263
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:37,140
the Germans nobody had weed we were

1264
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,199
selling it for 25 a joint

1265
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:42,118
this guy was selling joints for 25 and I

1266
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:43,439
was buying a hundred dollars man I was

1267
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,559

prepper down there huh I mean

1295
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,879

00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,200
little gathering recently when we had

1297

our little gathering recently or

1298
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:58,199
whatever uh one of the clear things that

1299
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,818
comes up is you can get people that have

1300
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:01,439
that have been in cannabis their whole

1301
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:04,019
life

1302
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
um and describing taste in Aroma is

1303
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:09,358
almost everyone's weak point

1304
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,220
you know you're like what does it taste

1305
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,119
like what does it smell like and to you

1306
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:17,338
you could be like oh this reminds me of

1307
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,619
1978 or this smells clearly like what I

1308
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:21,960
remember but if you try to piece

1309
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,599
together what that smell is the language

1310
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,579
is insufficient yeah

1311
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:30,420
there's a special language for that

1312
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:32,280
stuff and you know it's um and some of

1313
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,318
it is just experiential you know like

1314
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,599
when you talk about baby poo I think you

1315
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,599
were saying the other day not so about

1316
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:41,338
the smell of baby poo yeah people think

1317
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,740
that this is some you know some other

1318
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,539
way to say skunk or they're imagining

1319
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:47,759
something that they see on the toilet

1320
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:50,400
paper after they do their business but

1321
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,140
it's not it man it's a whole it's a if

1322
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,599
you've never had a kid or been around

1323
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:56,818
little babies you know you don't you

1324
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,338
you'll never smell that smell anywhere

1325
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:02,039
yeah that is no frame of reference to me

1326
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:04,318
yeah yeah I had yeah we had three kids

1327
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:07,500
in four years so the smell of young kid

1328
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:09,300
baby poo is is uh pretty pretty you know

1329
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,159
that was that was daily life for quite

1330
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,200
some time and it triggers and it

1331
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,899
triggers emotional you know memory

1332
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,338
response too you know that that smell

1333
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:21,960
it's all connected to the whole thing

1334
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:23,880
like I'm a Daddy you know but um yeah so

1335
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,318
I mean red we can do better than that

1336
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,280
right I mean it's so you're talking

1337
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:32,338
about gold Sandalwood is is uh is you

1338
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:37,079
know one of those Woody smells

1339
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:41,179
okay the the the really blonde gold to

1340
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:44,818
me had a a sandalwood incense

1341
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,960
burnt almost caramel almost sweet but

1342
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,358
not sweet

1343
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,940
and uh it was really good it had a

1344
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:53,460
different flavor on the exhale that was

1345
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,619
that was kind of addictive I you'd want

1346
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,500
to taste it again and again

1347
00:56:55,619 --> 00:57:00,780
and the the ones like the purples they

1348
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,179
didn't have a fruity flavor or smell

1349
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,099
like you'd think looking at it but it

1350
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:08,818
would have more like uh I've been a

1351
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:13,619
woody but not Cedar more like just a

1352
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:16,920
a wood wood incense taste and the Reds

1353
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:18,000
were very Cedar tasting with a delicious

1354
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,880
uh

1355
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,420
I can't tell it's like a

1356
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,160
burnt burnt malt almost

1357
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,159
you know it is

1358
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:35,880
burnt malt like a like a long wood

1359
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,020
all right we're cutting in and out again

1360
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,019
40 degrees

1361
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,519
sorry hey hey um so yeah you got laggy

1362
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,920
again and then I tried to talk so hey

1363
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:48,838
that burnt malt is that like a loamy

1364
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,420
kind of a peat

1365
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:54,358
but but let me tell you uh when I was

1366
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:57,960
growing up my in Texas my my uncle was

1367
00:57:54,358 --> 00:58:00,239
really wealthy and uh I had two cousins

1368
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,119
and one was a little bit older than I

1369
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:06,539
was and the other one was my age but uh

1370
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:09,420
my uncle when we got summer vacation

1371
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:11,460
uh that was just time we had to go to

1372
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,800
work for him and he owned these big

1373
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,119
property he was very close to DFW

1374
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,519
Airport

1375
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,318
and it was our job to mow them and I

1376
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:23,039
don't mean with a lawnmower I mean with

1377
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:26,460
a four cutter uh tractor

1378
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,679

1382
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,579
didn't have something to cut my my aunt

1383
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,159
and uncle would leave early for work and

1384
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:43,500
we'd get up and uh one more and go sit

1385
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,480
out on the front porch and smoke a

1388
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:53,399
I went outside and the air conditioning

1389
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,779
have you ever been in in really hot

1390
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,660
climate and you're in the air

1391
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,760
conditioning and you go outside and at

1392
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:03,139
first it feels good you know like I'm

1393
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,140
getting warm yeah

1394
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,818
for sure okay

1395
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:10,859
but I was sitting out there and I had my

1396
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:13,679
Marlboro Red and I was smoking it with

1397
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:15,420
my cousin the same age as me and my

1398
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:18,838
older cousin came out and said hey man

1399
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:21,780
roll a joint he threw me a bag a little

1400
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:24,179
bit of a baggie and I opened it up and I

1401
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,640
said what the [ __ ] is this it was yellow

1402
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:29,699
I mean it wasn't green at all there was

1403
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:32,039
no green or brown in it it was yellow it

1404
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:33,719
was real Colombian gold what are you

1405
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:37,139
talking about powder was it was it

1406
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:39,899
flakes no it was strings chunks nugs

1407
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:42,420
what would it look like

1408
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,280
it well it didn't look real pretty but

1409
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,380
it was just the color of it and it's

1410
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,359
full of seeds just like the Mexican but

1411
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:51,480
it wasn't real hard compressed it was

1412
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:53,338
like flat buds so it was busted up but

1413
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,260
it had been pressed

1414
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:57,659
yeah it had been pressed and they I

1415
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,579
guess he had broken it up but and it was

1416
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:02,818
only about a gram and a half it wasn't

1417
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,380
very much cool and I told him I said I

1418
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:06,298
don't think there's a joint here and he

1419
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,099
said [ __ ] man he said he sat down

1420
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:11,280
and rolled that pin joint you guys know

1421
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:13,318
that word pin joint yeah man little tiny

1422
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,540
like in the Cheech and Chong movie

1423
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:17,400
that's a toothpick man no that's a joint

1424
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:20,219
yeah

1425
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,500
but he we sparked that up and let me

1426
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:24,779
tell you I got a little bit more uh uh

1427
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,639
some words more adjectives to describe

1428
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:30,119
the taste and smell

1429
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:33,480
but this had a cardboard almost like a

1430
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:36,720
cardboard Coca-Cola

1431
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,940
uh and it had a hash taste similar to

1432
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:43,679
the Lebanese blonde

1433
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:46,079
yeah oh interesting yeah and uh it was a

1434
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,940
really really different taste in the I

1435
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,460
mean the the Mexican we got had no

1436
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:53,159
terpenes it was like Hey it tastes like

1437
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:56,818
grass really grass

1438
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:58,920
that hashiness that's uh that hashiness

1439
01:00:56,818 --> 01:01:01,259
is what I want to keep asking people if

1440
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:04,380
they think that there might be Indica in

1441
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:06,960
in Colombian gold you know Santa Marta

1442
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,079
whatever because that it was very real

1443
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,599
that it was

1444
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:15,480
and it was Heavy it had a it had a more

1445
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,640
I'll go into that later because there's

1446
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,960
a something I'd like to talk about how

1447
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:22,920
the these uh heirlooms Colombians

1448
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,559
occurred and I believe that happened

1449
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,480
about 150 years ago they weren't

1450
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,720
indigenous

1451
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,460
but anyway so we we I took one hit off

1452
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,338
of that and this is where we get the

1453
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,420
expression expando because it got in

1454
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:39,058
your lungs

1455
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:41,818
and man you couldn't hold it in you

1456
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:44,519
cough it out cough it out

1457
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:47,400
and next thing I know I was higher than

1458
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,079
you could I have ever been in my life I

1459
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,500
mean my eyes

1460
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:54,660
everything were crashed and my uncle

1461
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,420
called and said we had to go out and cut

1462
01:01:54,659 --> 01:02:00,139
this pasture and I said man I I can't do

1463
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,139
it I'm too funny

1464
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:05,460
I have to go work now

1465
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,619
my cousin was like come on smoke some

1466
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,880
more you'll be all right power through

1467
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:11,519
yeah

1468
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,619
but the thing is my uncle took us out in

1469
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,019
the middle of nowhere with a tractor on

1470
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:18,180
the trailer and and he gave us a cooler

1471
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:20,460
and I thought there'd be you know

1472
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:23,399
Gatorade or something like that but it

1473
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,440
was of course Coors beer it was before

1474
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,960
cell phones so if anything happened you

1475
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,039
were walking back yeah yeah if you cut

1476
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,039
your hand off or something

1477
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:38,400
we drank all that beer and got so drunk

1478
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:41,759
man I mean just absolutely wasted but by

1479
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,298
four o'clock the sun was I mean it was a

1480
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,280
terrible hangover yeah my bad and we

1481
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:49,318
smoked the rest of that we didn't finish

1482
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,420
that little pin joint we smoked the

1483
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:55,219
other half of it at the end of the day

1484
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:55,220
and crashed me again

1485
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:02,760
my uncle gave us a little 38 caliber

1486
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,220
revolver in case there was a snake or

1487
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,900
something you know I remember smoking

1488
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:08,818
that joint and I was looking at my other

1489
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,059
cousin going you know how to dance boy

1490
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:14,039
oh no

1491
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:17,819
yeah give the kids a revolver yeah

1492
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:20,039
Kingpin from an early age right but but

1493
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:21,960
that was when I first had good good

1494
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:24,179
Colombian there was other Colombian

1495
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:28,079
before that that I tried but it wasn't

1496
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:30,000
like this this was really different and

1497
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,559
I believed I do believe that there's

1498
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,318
Indica in it

1499
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:36,960
oh sweet finally somebody to agree with

1500
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:39,480
me on this crap that was there I mean

1501
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,720
The Taste sure the taster

1502
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:47,159
um suggests it right yeah cash flavor

1503
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:51,358
the hip the hit was just boom and look I

1504
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,578
remember I simplified Indica right I

1505
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,098
mean I don't know

1506
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:57,900
you know I mean wide Leaf Indica had all

1507
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,000
these things I'm sorry keep going so

1508
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,160
remember when

1509
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,699
uh

1510
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:08,039
uh in the in the late 20s there were

1511
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:11,519
several pharmaceutical companies that

1512
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:15,900
came through here in Santa Marta in the

1513
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:18,000
peninsula and uh one of them was bear

1514
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,700
and what they brought with them this is

1515
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,619
all factual this all really happened and

1516
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:26,399
they brought with them what was called

1517
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:30,180
uh Indian hemp

1518
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:33,420
and this was Indica from India India

1519
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:35,219
or their pictures several years they had

1520
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,680
developed one of the strongest

1521
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:39,779
cannabinoid producing plants that had

1522
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:43,798
ever been discovered up till then even

1523
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:46,920
better than in in India yeah but at the

1524
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:49,440
same time that was right when marijuana

1525
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,559
was demonized in the United States and

1526
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,480
all cannabis medicine was pulled you

1527
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,960
know they in the in the beginning of the

1528
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,420
30s they they started so they all pulled

1529
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:03,059
out all these pharmaceutical companies

1530
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,639
but the the campesinos the Colombians

1531
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:08,579
they kept the seeds yeah and they kept

1532
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:11,519
growing it you know and by the late 50s

1533
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:13,260
early 60s they had a product that was

1534
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:14,759
superior man I mean this [ __ ] would

1535
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,579
knock you on your ass

1536
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,700
no and that's really starting exporting

1537
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:22,920
what part of the country was the kind of

1538
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:25,019
the epicenter for this

1539
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,260
well this this from what I understand

1540
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:30,719
was all in on the coast Santa Martha and

1541
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:34,260
la wahia which is a peninsula that goes

1542
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:36,118
out uh close to Venezuela now when I've

1543
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,579
thrown this out to people before they

1544
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:41,400
said you know Santa Marta is an unlikely

1545
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:44,400
place for a big Pharma company to go

1546
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,680
locate an operation like this you know

1547
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,099
that they're big businesses do things

1548
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:53,338
big business way he just said it didn't

1549
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:55,260
seem to click right with that what what

1550
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:57,599
do you think about that

1551
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,700
well I believe it's pretty much a fact

1552
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,140
and is documented that they were in

1553
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:02,399
Santa Martha I don't know if they

1554
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,500
actually had

1555
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,740
yeah I don't know the plantations there

1556
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:10,019
let me tell you the Santa Monica this

1557
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:12,539
this entire cordello that goes up it's

1558
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:15,719
the highest coastal range in the world

1559
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:18,058
it goes from sea level up to 20

1560
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,399
something thousand feet snow-capped

1561
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:22,140
mountains yeah there's a million

1562
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,260
microclimates there and it's

1563
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:27,298
inaccessible it's still very remote to

1564
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,760
to go there you have to hike in and

1565
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:31,940
everything else

1566
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,079
so I I can see there

1567
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:36,119
you know that's where they were

1568
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,700
exporting all the gold they were they

1569
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:43,818
were actually using tractors to to farm

1570
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:43,818
the Cannabis there oh wow yeah

1571
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:51,298
contrasted with Afghanistan you know or

1572
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,700
India I don't know you know invite the

1573
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:56,460
climate I'm just wondering how

1574
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:58,618
how how much selection pressure the

1575
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,318
difference in the climate really placed

1576
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:03,019
on the these foreign strains that they'd

1577
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:06,659
brought there you know what what what

1578
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:10,139
survived what thrived in the new

1579
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:12,598
new world right and how did that turn

1580
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:15,179
out looking 20 years later and and was

1581
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:17,280
it by the hand of man or you know were

1582
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:19,739
these things that was it done in two

1583
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,460
crosses and then sat in a freezer I mean

1584
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,459
because that

1585
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,740
it does yeah yeah from from my

1586
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:31,139
experience of of growing here

1587
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:34,399
uh environments everything I mean

1588
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:37,379
genetics are a good 50 but the other 50

1589
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,079
is the environment and I've taken a

1590
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:43,079
clone the same clone and brought it down

1591
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,180
500 meters to a different location it's

1592
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:48,119
a very very close to the original but

1593
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:52,558
500 meters down totally different plant

1594
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:54,660
yeah yeah totally different morphology I

1595
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,599
mean it still has what I what I did it

1596
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:59,940
with was my uh uh it's a train wreck

1597
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,220
Panama that I really like and I grew a

1598
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:05,220
clone and zupicon and I took another

1599
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:09,118
clone down the kachupai which is down in

1600
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:11,038
the valley about 500 meters lower yeah

1601
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,200
and the guy grew it for me and we've

1602
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,420
compared Buds and everything and it was

1603
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,519
different it was really different wow

1604
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,319
that's wild like um did you get to see

1605
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:25,980
the difference in the the leaf width

1606
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:28,319
well yeah yeah the the no I really can't

1607
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:31,379
say there was a difference in that but

1608
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,359
they were shorter and swatter the higher

1609
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,400
up it went and the lower controls down

1610
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,960
the more they try to get bigger and

1611
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:39,778
bushier

1612
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,119
see I could grow right now at a much

1613
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:44,219
lower elevation and it'd probably be a

1614
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:46,259
lot easier but the pathogens and the

1615
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,560
insects are and I don't want to live

1616
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:53,298
there I don't want to live

1617
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:55,739
yeah I could understand that yeah

1618
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:57,539
that's that's a big part of it right why

1619
01:08:55,738 --> 01:09:01,318
you went down there and everything

1620
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:04,380
absolute it still is is

1621
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:08,699
I'm still looking for that perfect that

1622
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:11,219
just that Niche you know perfect sure

1623
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:13,879
topology is very important Colombia's

1624
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:16,560
like Mexico it's really really

1625
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,659
mountainous is there bamboo are there

1626
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,759
like big band we could build a giant

1627
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:26,159
bamboo freaking like Master Command

1628
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,920
Center kind of jutting out of a hillside

1629
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:32,399
all all cantilevered and stuff you know

1630
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,600
with big big support beams and and we'd

1631
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,099
have a view of the whole valley

1632
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,279
underneath us

1633
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:40,079
and uh the sound of of you know like

1634
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,900
bongo drums would be playing in the

1635
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,640
background Non-Stop and the smoke would

1636
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:48,479
waft through the air

1637
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:51,239
oh yeah but occasionally uh you'd run

1638
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:54,419
into other times Thai in particular tie

1639
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:57,718
stick I I never owned Thai stick but I

1640
01:09:54,420 --> 01:10:00,300
smoked a little bit of it and uh there

1641
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:02,399
was a bunch of good Mexicans Jamaican we

1642
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:04,739
used to get real Jamaican that was

1643
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:08,519
pretty good at first

1644
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:11,159
uh real CD brown but had a had a really

1645
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,500
uplifting clean High all right we'll put

1646
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:15,779
a time put a time stamp on that because

1647
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,179
you know when when was it good and then

1648
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:20,819
it wasn't good what's can you help us

1649
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:24,960
with that it was good around when I

1650
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:26,698
first tried it around 77. I was pretty

1651
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,039
good it was good it was better than

1652
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:33,839
maybe our equal to good Colombian and by

1653
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,600
1982 when I returned to the United

1654
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,199
States it was [ __ ] man it wasn't it's

1655
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:44,460
all seeds it wasn't any good yeah 82 and

1656
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:47,039
later right yep and 82 is when I started

1657
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,840
really seeing sense of media the

1658
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,840
Colombian was pretty much gone

1659
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:56,579
I seem to remember a story about that

1660
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:59,340
the Colombians started using Jamaica as

1661
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:01,679
a waypoint for smoke or somebody in

1662
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,679
South America started using Jamaica as a

1663
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:07,440
stopover point for smuggling powders

1664
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:10,260
into the U.S and it really changed the

1665
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:12,960
the whole environment maybe maybe your

1666
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:15,539
supply line of of the good stuff from

1667
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,520
the island was just interrupted and and

1668
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:19,140
that it still existed there but you guys

1669
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,940
just weren't getting it that's always a

1670
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,940
possibility right

1671
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:27,479
yeah well like I said I had a very

1672
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:30,419
limited I I I didn't know big like mad

1673
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:32,759
Jag I didn't know big people like that I

1674
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,699
just know people on the street snoozers

1675
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,199
regular guy

1676
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:40,259
that's how I picture it anyway so don't

1677
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:43,379
spoil it with anything let me tell you a

1678
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:45,659
quick quick story about bamboo and Kachi

1679
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:48,659
pie what are we gonna do man we're

1680
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:48,658
is

1681
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:56,580
lower elevation than zupacon it's on the

1682
01:11:53,698 --> 01:12:00,839
same road it's on the same it's a Camino

1683
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:03,899
Real it's an ancient Road Spanish Road

1684
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,760
but uh so that's out of the uh out of

1685
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:08,279
the below the cloud layer

1686
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,560
yes this is this is below that cloud

1687
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:13,679
layer now you're getting down into about

1688
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,940
1 500 meters

1689
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:22,199
where zpicon is up around 2 000 meters

1690
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:24,479
and bogota's 2700 meters

1691
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:31,559
so it's going up you're going up this

1692
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:33,658
giant Plateau well how far how far in um

1693
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,699
preferably in Miles because I don't

1694
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:39,539
understand kilometers a bit because I'm

1695
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:41,939
a dumb American but but how far from

1696
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:43,738
Bogota are you when you're talking about

1697
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:46,319
zepocon from

1698
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:49,259
like Bogota miles wise

1699
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,960
uh well everything's about two hours

1700
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:54,239
distance okay yeah that's helpful but

1701
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,579
two hours like driving up a mountain

1702
01:12:54,238 --> 01:13:00,000
that's crazy roads or

1703
01:12:56,579 --> 01:13:03,479
well maybe one hour of it the other that

1704
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,158
we have really good Autobahn quality uh

1705
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:08,339
roads here really highways super

1706
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:10,799
highways it's when you get into the road

1707
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,840
that goes from the main Highway down to

1708
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,840
supercon then it starts getting to be

1709
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,079
like a real twisty

1710
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,260
I mean it's it's it's safe but there's

1711
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:24,420
always Rock slides and

1712
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,360
safe don't worry about it just some

1713
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:29,219
wrong slides

1714
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:30,960
and spiders are there are there like a

1715
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:34,079
lot of poison spiders down there because

1716
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,779
Australia is filled with those things so

1717
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,939
now I got bit by some kind of spider and

1718
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,079
zupacon got sick and went to the doctor

1719
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:42,000
they'd give me some kind of

1720
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,579
antihistamine that almost gave me a

1721
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,179
heart attack but no I never see them

1722
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:51,600
very much because I'm up in altitude

1723
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:55,500
where I am there's no flies no spiders

1724
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:58,500
it's clean beautiful temperate climate

1725
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:01,260
cement this guy's got it figured out

1726
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:03,000
I know yeah that's how long is the first

1727
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,980
thing I asked him what it wasn't about

1728
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,859
the safety it was how bad are the

1729
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:10,019
insects I'm terrified of insects I can

1730
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:12,599
take humans I'm okay with I can deal

1731
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,760
with that fish insects they suck man

1732
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,400
it's an army they're marching the Earth

1733
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,340
right now they have a plan

1734
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:22,079
you know we don't even notice it's

1735
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,760
happening around us because their their

1736
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,279
timeline is just completely different

1737
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:31,940
from humans but yeah and pretty soon

1738
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:31,939
yeah it's too late

1739
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:39,479
they are edible

1740
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:41,579
they better watch us yeah

1741
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:44,218
but let me tell you this about this

1742
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:46,738
adventure with Ruth uh Ruth is my

1743
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:49,679

1746
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:57,359
know so we could tie the plants up with

1747
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:59,459
it and we go to Kachi pie and she starts

1748
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:02,099
talking to this guy random guy on the

1749
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:04,380
street and he's like yeah man I know

1750
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,199
where the bamboo is you know so he hops

1751
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,119
in the truck and we start going down the

1752
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,339
valley and he says keep going keep going

1753
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,179
we're passing this door passing that

1754
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,579
store

1755
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:18,060

well how big was it how big was it I'm

1763
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:40,140
just curious what you know well it's not

1764
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:42,119
actually bamboo uh it's it's some other

1765
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,219
plant that's similar to Bamboo that

1766
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,679
grows here but it was about that big in

1767
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:49,920
diameter it was that mid-sized tubes

1768
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:52,260
yeah that's no joke wow

1769
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,060
but uh it was a fun adventure because

1770
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,980
this guy was like kept saying we were

1771
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,620

this guy taking us man well speaking of

1773

where is he taking us it seems like

1774
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:06,260
you've taken us to Colombia already at

1775
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:10,440
this point how did we get there I mean

1776
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:12,480
just timelining it right that's uh I'm

1777
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:15,000
gonna be chopping things around yeah so

are they doing are they doing big indoor

1779
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,380
operations down there and is that

1780
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:22,500
affordable like kilowatt hour

1781
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:24,239
price yeah

1782
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:28,260

foreign cannabis companies come here is

1785
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:36,000
to exploit the people because here the

1786
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,340
people will work for a hundred dollars a

1787
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
month and that's a pretty good rate yeah

1788
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:45,119
and the electricity is real cheap here

1789
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,960
God how blind you know I mean how big

1790
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:51,719
big industry rolls into you know the the

1791
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,260
hotbed of cannabis in the world you know

1792
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:57,899
besides Thailand probably right now and

1793
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:01,460
they ignore the Nash the natural

1794
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:05,039
treasure that is that lives only there

1795
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:08,779
and uh see it just as another as another

1796
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,519
uh resource pit to be steamrolled

1797
01:17:08,779 --> 01:17:14,519
exploitation

1798
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:16,860
what a nightmare like every commodity

1799
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:20,040
okay but let me tell you what they do

1800
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:22,679
there's a big German company gmw

1801
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:25,679
Laboratories right here in Piper

1802
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:28,739
and they have uh I don't know if I I

1803
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:31,819
guess it's about 10 acres of greenhouses

1804
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:34,639
and what they do is run

1805
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:37,399
non-psychoactive and it's all on hydro

1806
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:42,600
hydroponics in greenhouses

1807
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:46,759
it's set up hold on they're growing hemp

1808
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,440
with Hydro in greenhouses

1809
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:52,500
wait

1810
01:17:48,439 --> 01:17:55,198
oh my god well it's non-psychoactive

1811
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,960
it's to me it's hemp but it's yeah yeah

1812
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:01,259
it's like candy dad

1813
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:04,980
okay yeah Harlequin and AC DC

1814
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:07,440
Harley Quinn uh uh all the the what's

1815
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:09,779
the other one the

1816
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:12,359
Charlotte's Web all those yeah yeah yeah

1817
01:18:09,779 --> 01:18:14,039
these are these are ones I don't want to

1818
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:15,839
work with and I don't really even like I

1819
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:17,460
had many of them and I don't really want

1820
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,880
to grow any more of it

1821
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:23,100
you know yeah but that here's the kicker

1822
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,500
when I went there they're all wanting me

1823
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:28,079
to help them and everything and I'm

1824
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:30,420
doing the tour I'm wearing this this

1825
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:33,779
HEPA suit or something you know with all

1826
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,460
this stuff on and yeah and uh I really

1827
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:38,158
didn't like it and they said okay here's

1828
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:42,859
where we do our drawing we put it in the

1829
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,859
drying oven for 24 hours

1830
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:51,899
what the [ __ ] dude yeah and this young

1831
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,119
young Colombian guy comes out he's in

1832
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:55,579
the scientist outfit and I said what are

1833
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:58,920
you doing man don't you even understand

1834
01:18:55,579 --> 01:19:00,600
he destroys all those beautiful volatile

1835
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,319
terpenes and things

1836
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:06,900
and he had no concept of that

1837
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:10,198
well he does he did after he talked to

1838
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:14,519
you yeah well now now that it changed

1839
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:16,859
and they've gone to uh dry freezing

1840
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:19,040
which I think is a very better change

1841
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:22,198
because they're getting but it's still

1842
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,060
non-psychoactive it's all CBD yeah and

1843
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:26,698
it's all sitting in a warehouse they

1844
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:29,280
haven't sold one gram

1845
01:19:26,698 --> 01:19:30,500
yeah it sounds like the the United

1846
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,800
States

1847
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:37,380
coming to a gas station near you yeah

1848
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:40,320
exactly like when I when I did that big

1849
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:42,119
hint reversal and got to go out to the

1850
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:44,158
big fields and stuff and see what they

1851
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:46,920
did at the with the end product

1852
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:49,879
it was literally tossed in fields of

1853
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:53,940
dirt with goat heads in it just piled up

1854
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:56,400
not even in crates just dirt on the dirt

1855
01:19:53,939 --> 01:19:58,738
and they just had people come scoop it

1856
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,439
up turn it into isolate move it on and

1857
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:03,359
biomass I I was just mine was

1858
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:05,399
mind-blowing how it was kept not even in

1859
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:07,799
crates in the dirt just

1860
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:12,559
in the dirt out in the open Fields just

1861
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,560
to get everything yeah it's gross

1862
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,579
I have no interest in big big operations

1863
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:22,139
I I don't want to be involved I don't

1864
01:20:20,579 --> 01:20:24,840
want to talk to those people

1865
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:27,239
what I enjoy is growing the best that I

1866
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,279
can and teaching the young people I know

1867
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:31,619
how to do what I do

1868
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:34,679
it's a completely different craft in my

1869
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:36,658
opinion like it's a totally different it

1870
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:38,658
they're almost unrelated except that

1871
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:41,698
they happen to work with a similar plan

1872
01:20:38,658 --> 01:20:43,920
when you come when you come and see me

1873
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:45,259
and you smoke with me you'll know the

1874
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,239
difference

1875
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:50,460
you'll see the light you I can tell you

1876
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:53,158
I can draw you pictures send you videos

1877
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,859
but do you hit that until you hit it

1878
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:57,779
with me

1879
01:20:54,859 --> 01:21:00,599
that's the only way to truly tell it

1880
01:20:57,779 --> 01:21:03,960
really is hey man I've got a question

1881
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:06,000
about you know the emerging Colombian

1882
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,980
um commercial scene right so they're

1883
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,319
they're I assume red they're going to

1884
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:13,139
start having dispensaries and stuff pop

1885
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:16,439
up and it's and uh retail you know it's

1886
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:18,119
going to become a retail product

1887
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,799
um you know fancy packaging and

1888
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:23,519
everything like it does everywhere else

1889
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,739
to fill our landfills but um

1890
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,780
so Matt I mean you saw it out in

1891
01:21:25,738 --> 01:21:29,698
California

1892
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:33,300
um I'm sure you have some thoughts about

1893
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:37,619
the the dispensaries as the kind of

1894
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:41,520
taste maker uh the opinion shaper for in

1895
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:44,099
a commercial legal recreational market

1896
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,960
like that you know do people just buy

1897
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:49,380
what they're pointed to when they walk

1898
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:52,739
into the store to yes and and is it all

1899
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:56,520
just about looks and and nothing about

1900
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:59,099
effect nothing like in my communication

1901
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,600
yeah in California the way I've always

1902
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,739
seen it work and I've been to a lot of

1903
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,920
different places in a lot of different

1904
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:09,000
cities even even in Colorado and uh

1905
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,039
Oregon it's a bud tender who has zero

1906
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,340
experience or knowledge in my opinion

1907
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:16,619
I've never met it's so rare unless it's

1908
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,140
like a friend that I've had like kind of

1909
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:22,079
put into a dispensary that I know knows

1910
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:25,199
their stuff and that's so rare but

1911
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,760
it I just never really just on occasion

1912
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,379
met someone that really knew what they

1913
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,840
were talking about I'd say oh you want a

1914
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,260
hybrid but even if you want to be sleepy

1915
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:36,119
get a hybrid

1916
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:38,100
are they even gonna have anything though

1917
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,579
I mean are they would they even have a

1918
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:43,940
narrow uh they wouldn't know I mean 16

1919
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:46,019
week

1920
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:48,599
there's no way there's no way because

1921
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:52,860
they'd be paying nobody grows out here

1922
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:54,179
so I mean how does how does Colombia do

1923
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:56,880
it different

1924
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:59,100
what what kind of changes could you know

1925
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,020
I mean if if you had it to do over again

1926
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,719
Matt you've seen it up close and

1927
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:07,199
personal I mean how would How would how

1928
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:09,239
can it be done differently to and I this

1929
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:11,819
seems like a Sidetrack but I think red

1930
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:14,339
has kind of a vested interest in this

1931
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:15,840
stuff and and you've got knowledge and

1932
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:18,420
experience

1933
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,920
you know I I don't know that I would be

1934
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,300
the right person to ask on how to do it

1935
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,579
different because I'm such a pessimist

1936
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,679
but I'm interested in Red's opinion on

1937
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:27,420
how he would do it different than what

1938
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,000
he said

1939
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:33,179
well first of all recreational or

1940
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:37,140
personal use is not legal here

1941
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:40,140
but it is now you can you can have up to

1942
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:42,300
20 grams it's just not commercialized

1943
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,840
not regulated but you can have 20 grams

1944
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:49,980
of weed you can have five grams of hash

1945
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:53,579
legally okay but uh the laws have not

1946
01:23:49,979 --> 01:23:57,539
changed and what they consider more than

1947
01:23:53,579 --> 01:24:00,840
19 plants is micro trafficking that

1948
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:03,840
you're you're selling at micro

1949
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,940
right but I think it's going to follow

1950
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,860
where you are I think it's going to be

1951
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:09,899
because they love California they're

1952
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:12,839
always looking at the laws there they're

1953
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:15,420
always modeling things after up there

1954
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,360
that is so scary right because it just

1955
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:20,760
it just like what what we realized or

1956
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:23,939
what I realized really early on being

1957
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:27,420
from the the grower side

1958
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:30,779
was that the more corporate it got the

1959
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:33,179
more legal or quasi-legal it looked for

1960
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:35,219
people to be able to smoke

1961
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:38,279
while they're still trying to push

1962
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:39,960
through these like THC percent maximum

1963
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:43,500
max out type things in the background

1964
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:45,719
but they made it more illegal or more

1965
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:48,238
easy to tax the [ __ ] out of you if you

1966
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:50,760
grow and took the ability for you to

1967
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:54,439
produce your own medicine for free at

1968
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:57,600
home away from you and people

1969
01:24:54,439 --> 01:25:00,238
like the idea of just being able to go

1970
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,980
buy it as an end product more than they

1971
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,959
like the idea of being able to grow it

1972
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:06,959
because it just seems like a lot to do

1973
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:10,460
but in the end I think it's a big loss

1974
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,460
for everyone to go that route

1975
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:16,319
well remember remember too though that

1976
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:18,239
here it's a lot different I mean you can

1977
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:20,099
flower year round you don't have to set

1978
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,099
up lights you don't have to put a lot of

1979
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:25,980
effort into growing it like that

1980
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:28,320
but I I and I don't want to offend I

1981
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:30,658
have more respect for Colombians and the

1982
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:33,359
Colombians themselves but the thing

1983
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:35,939
about them is they like fads they like

1984
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,619
the you know they want to do what you're

1985
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:40,919
doing you know they want to do what's

1986
01:25:37,619 --> 01:25:43,140
going on in New York and stuff so that a

1987
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,239
lot of it's you can go now they have

1988
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:47,940
dispensaries where you can go and and

1989
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:50,579
you can walk in and buy weed leaves yeah

1990
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:52,738
well not leisurely but you know you can

1991
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:55,738
buy it it's real you can go to any any

1992
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:57,779
uh open market right where they have

1993
01:25:55,738 --> 01:26:01,259
potatoes and corn and you can buy weed

1994
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:02,698
there too that's awesome you know did

1995
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,139
they get messed up a lot you just buy

1996
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:06,419
the plant and take it home you don't

1997
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:08,819
even break it down just jump in the taxi

1998
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:10,819
I've done that many times whole plant

1999
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:14,819
hanging out the window

2000
01:26:10,819 --> 01:26:17,340
did the does the police or government

2001
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:19,380
mess with people a lot or try to tax

2002
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:22,920
them at that point when they see it or

2003
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:26,400
how does that work well mostly they they

2004
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:28,800
they get you when you're moving you know

2005
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:32,399
like if you go to a bus station or if

2006
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:35,340
you go on a a Taxis cars that's how they

2007
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,158
get you but in your house they I've

2008
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:40,739
never had anybody come in my house and

2009
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:43,319
uh I don't want to get myself in trouble

2010
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:45,839
but I've grown a lot more than 20 plants

2011
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:48,420
in my house and yeah I mean I've had

2012
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:52,199
police come in and say wow you have some

2013
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:55,020
beautiful plants man boys

2014
01:26:52,198 --> 01:26:56,698
but yeah I hope it changes and there

2015
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,139
right now I don't know if you know it

2016
01:26:56,698 --> 01:27:00,299
but if you look at the news they're

2017
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:03,359
having these big cannabis marches

2018
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:06,480
because they want the new president to

2019
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,559
sign into law the what they call adult

2020
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,379
use

2021
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,060
and that's just regulated and they're

2022
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:14,400
pushing them because they want they want

2023
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:17,159
it to be here like it is everywhere and

2024
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:19,799
we're working real hard together right

2025
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:22,698
now to actually find another function

2026
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:25,980
that microclimate that I deem as perfect

2027
01:27:22,698 --> 01:27:29,158
and getting it all set up the thing is

2028
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:31,379
is so much with the regulations and all

2029
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:34,319
this money she's having to spend to be

2030
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:37,079
able to to get the licensing I bet yeah

2031
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:40,319
well we've been working five years five

2032
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:42,779
years on this project and wow yeah

2033
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:45,479
but it's coming together man I'm telling

2034
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:47,399

2035
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:50,879

easy to do I need to learn if you hear a

2048
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,239
groaning sound it's it's the internet of

2049

saying that we are now able to to do

2058
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:47,339
that legally we yeah

2059
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:48,960
you may want to clarify what would be

2060
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,420
involved with doing that you know I mean

2061

2093
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:30,479
2012. right at the beginning of 2012.

2094
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:34,800

pound of the same good Brown Colombian

2096
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:41,039

2139
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:32,579
going through it real flowery smell yeah

2140
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:38,039
nice up high it I guess was skunk number

2141
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:40,139
one okay okay then uh I then it changed

2142
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:43,139
then then it changed I started getting

2143
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:44,579
it from another guy and it was these big

2144
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:48,319
clumps

2145
01:32:44,579 --> 01:32:53,039
like a big hard clump of compressed or

2146
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:55,799
vacuum bagged uh again Indica Bud yeah

2147
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,600
seedless completely seedless no I guess

2148
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,340
it was like beasters

2149
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,380
gotcha

2150
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:03,600
and uh

2151
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:05,520
that was the creepy and pretty soon I

2152
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,440
didn't like it that much although I

2153
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:11,219
bought it because I wasn't growing at

2154
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:13,500
the time yeah but I did find one seed I

2155
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:15,300
found a seed in it normally I never have

2156
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,039
found seeds so if you have seeds you're

2157
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:19,739
lucky yeah yeah

2158
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:22,800
but wait what year did you first

2159
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:25,738
encounter it okay when I first saw

2160
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,300
creepy it was the beginning of 2012.

2161
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:28,738
interesting because that's about the

2162
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:31,020
time that I got those seeds sent up

2163
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:32,698
that's I was like I wonder if this is

2164
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:36,300
the same guy because like it was on Mr

2165
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:39,419
Nice same era and the guy when he sent

2166
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:42,179
it to me he spelled it creepy

2167
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:44,158
and I was like uh I don't know like I'd

2168
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:46,199
never heard of that and then later on I

2169
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:47,759
saw another Colombian spell at cr-i-p-i

2170
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:50,178
and I was like oh my God maybe the dude

2171
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:53,400
was right you know like he wasn't just

2172
01:33:50,179 --> 01:33:55,500
calling you creepy because that's very

2173
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:58,259
possible this is a common nickname for

2174
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:01,460
me well you kind of came across that way

2175
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:03,780
in some of those posts and and you know

2176
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:05,399
the males might have been in the the

2177
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:07,439
seeds might have been in the mail before

2178
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:10,738
he kind of realized hey this guy's kind

2179
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:12,719
of creepy and he said here's some creepy

2180
01:34:10,738 --> 01:34:16,939
for you yeah yeah this is possible

2181
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:20,158
you're creepy I said some creepy things

2182
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:23,460
but but creepy is outdoor grown it's

2183
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:27,779
grown in uh all over Colombia antiochia

2184
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:31,079
calca even even up in uh near Cartagena

2185
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:32,880
and let me tell you I don't I I'm

2186
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:34,559
naturally against it and don't like it

2187
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,779
because number one I don't smoke a lot

2188
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:40,320
of Indica number two it's commercial and

2189
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:43,559
yeah and it it gives me a bad fact the

2190
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:46,079
negative effect it does mean yeah but in

2191
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:48,659
Cartagena when I bought a nice chunk of

2192
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:51,960
it it was excellent man it was it was

2193
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:54,859
uplifting it was uh really a good but it

2194
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:58,198
looked just like the other individual

2195
01:34:54,859 --> 01:35:00,960
Clump but it had a stellar High brought

2196
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:03,500
some back with me from uh Cartagena two

2197
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,500
years ago

2198
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:09,359
that was uh

2199
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:11,520
it wasn't the same as what I had in

2200
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,738
Cartagena so it would you real real

2201
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,420
quick I'm sorry Matt the uh

2202
01:35:13,738 --> 01:35:17,158
um these guys they're it's industrial

2203
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:19,980
they're they're they're growing for

2204
01:35:17,158 --> 01:35:22,439
profit they you know what how are they

2205
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:23,819
about chemicals and pesticides and stuff

2206
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:27,419
like that I mean are you getting a clean

2207
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:28,439
product with this or what is it full of

2208
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:32,279
chemicals

2209
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:35,638
oh yeah no flushing either I mean it

2210
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:38,099
burns black so a lot of it burns black

2211
01:35:35,639 --> 01:35:40,800
now there there it varies there's a

2212
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:43,020
bunch of different types of it

2213
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,420
but the real shitty stuff Burns black

2214
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:47,460
and has a cami taste and they all use

2215
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:50,399
pesticide chemicals

2216
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:52,439
they have to yeah it makes sense

2217
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:54,960
um so would you say because I know

2218
01:35:52,439 --> 01:35:57,238
people are gonna be yelling at me if I

2219
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,079
don't pin you down on it would you say

2220
01:35:57,238 --> 01:36:00,539
that

2221
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:01,859
crippy is something like and this is

2222
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:04,859
just what I'm

2223
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:07,698
hearing you say but maybe you can tell

2224
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:11,039
me if I'm wrong it's some sort of

2225
01:36:07,698 --> 01:36:14,399
commercial probably Dutch import type

2226
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:17,399
like skunk one or one of those types

2227
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:21,019
and any of them will do it's just a

2228
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:24,238
non-columbian based

2229
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:27,000
afghani-based type plant grown there

2230
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:28,979
yeah he will do yeah same thing like

2231
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,039
they did in Mexico I mean not just

2232
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:34,019
exactly okay these aren't happy Growers

2233
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:37,019
that are doing these are people that are

2234
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:39,120
hand to mouth I mean they're yeah for

2235
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:40,679
survival and they don't even give a [ __ ]

2236
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:42,960
about the genetics or anything yeah

2237
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:46,199
exactly buy trays of clones put them out

2238
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,300
and it's a it's cartel weed it's yeah

2239
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:49,500
and people that bring you cocaine make

2240
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:54,060
this [ __ ]

2241
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:55,979
yeah and so when do you think

2242
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:58,139
from people you've spoken to when do you

2243
01:36:55,979 --> 01:37:00,238
think that term crippy first started

2244
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:02,579
getting used or

2245
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:05,759
applied to weed like that

2246
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:09,079
well see I left Columbia in the summer

2247
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:12,600
of 2007 and went back to Georgia

2248
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:15,300
uh and and when I left there wasn't any

2249
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,820
creepy and when I came back that's when

2250
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:20,340
it was there and I came back in 2011 and

2251
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:22,139
it was there then gotcha and I don't

2252
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,139
know when it happened I bet it probably

2253
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:28,980
happened

2254
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:31,679
2008 2009 interesting yeah

2255
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:34,439
but it's it's some of it's good some of

2256
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,779
it's bad but when you live in Colombia

2257
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:38,460
and you smoke you should be growing your

2258
01:37:36,779 --> 01:37:39,559
own weed you know yeah it sounds like

2259
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,239
this

2260
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:43,920
that's like going to a prostitute when

2261
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:45,379
you're married to Lonnie Anderson you

2262

01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,279
that would talk to me and that was a

2285

he used to send me uh you might have

2312
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:04,319
heard of red snake uh the the oaxacan uh

2313
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:06,959
uh Punta Rojo cross yeah how was that oh

2314
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:08,698

2315
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,739
excellent but that never got out

2316
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:13,019
publicly he wouldn't sell that or

2317
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:16,819
mestiza which which is another one I

2318
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:20,840
really like Max diza which one was that

2319
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:23,819
oaxacan and Mission mcconn and yeah

2320
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,400
now how do you spell that because I

2321
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:29,279
think you're saying Mex teaser

2322
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:31,099
with a t is that is that right or is

2323
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:34,198
okay okay

2324
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:36,780
gotcha now I think I saw that for sale

2325
01:40:34,198 --> 01:40:38,219
for I saw that for sale for years that

2326
01:40:36,779 --> 01:40:40,079
that was on the market

2327
01:40:38,219 --> 01:40:42,480
yeah the mix diesel was there was a mix

2328
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:44,939
of Melia too from another company there

2329
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:47,638
was like a oaxacan Burmese I think that

2330
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:49,619
doesn't mean that what you've got is the

2331
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:51,480
same thing as what went on the market

2332
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:52,979
though right that's very true yeah

2333
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:55,799
because a lot of the stuff like would be

2334
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:57,959
like uh whatever he worked cross to like

2335

2352
01:41:40,618 --> 01:41:46,019
tell you Ruth my partner has gotten

2353
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:48,439
spent so much time with the health

01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:52,860
department the agricultural Department

2355
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:55,559
the Justice Ministry that she's really

2356
01:41:52,859 --> 01:41:58,198
well connected with them and she knows

2357
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,100
exactly what's legal and exactly what's

2358
01:41:58,198 --> 01:42:01,979
not

2359
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:03,840
and I I I put a lot of faith in

2360
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:06,419
everything she says of course I do what

2361
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,800
I want to do too yeah well you're

2362
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:09,539
different you're a different part of the

2363
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
operation and you know it seems to me

2364
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:13,500
that if anybody's going to be successful

2365
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:15,179
in this in the legal cannabis World

2366
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:18,000
you've got to have somebody in the

2367
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:20,639
organization that's focused on that

2368
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,139
interface with The Regulators with

2369
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:25,440
government

2370
01:42:22,139 --> 01:42:28,199
um and who doesn't you know who who can

2371
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,238
actually do that kind of work and and be

2372
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:32,759
successful with it you know I mean some

2373
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,799
people can can do it other people hate

2374
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,440
that kind of work and avoid it at all

2375
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:40,340
costs not pointing any fingers here but

2376
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:43,198
I think there may be three people here

2377
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:45,239
who probably feel that way

2378
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,039
um so it's great that you got that

2379
01:42:45,238 --> 01:42:49,618
partner you know you complimentary

2380
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:51,960
skills teaming up you're the Visionary

2381
01:42:49,618 --> 01:42:55,198
you know it when you see it you know how

2382
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:56,698
to do it she's she's handling the part

2383
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:59,519
that you're not good at and you're doing

2384
01:42:56,698 --> 01:43:02,059
the part she's not so it's awesome well

2385
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,340
I I want to really give a good uh

2386
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:08,400
recommendation to her because she she

2387
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:11,940
listens to me and and and under not just

2388
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:13,559
listens to me but understands and a lot

2389
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:16,019
of people hear you but they don't

2390
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,360
understand you she understands me and

2391
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,820
understands what I want to do and

2392
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:24,799
believes in it and that we we feed off

2393
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:24,799
each other like that or I feel like that

2394
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:30,719
it's like constant roadblocks and and

2395
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,939
interruptions to your to your you know

2396
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,039
your dreams right so and those things

2397
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:37,618
are can can

2398
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,479
um be demotivating and depressing and a

2399
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:41,279
lot of people quit right before they get

2400
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:44,099
to the finish line so

2401
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:45,960
oh yeah Partnerships or marriages too

2402
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,280
you know like they really are like

2403
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:49,260
marriages are very important

2404
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:50,579
communication is important and when

2405
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:52,679
you're in a serious business

2406
01:43:50,579 --> 01:43:54,059
relationship with someone it's like a

2407
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:56,399
marriage that you can't just leave

2408
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:57,960
because there's responsibilities there's

2409
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:00,179
all kinds of commitments that you have

2410
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,340
to each other uh whether Financial or

2411
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:04,260
otherwise and it's uh yeah it's you have

2412
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:06,239
to take it serious like that and and

2413
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:08,760
when one of the partners is just a

2414
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:11,638
complete prick it's it's almost

2415
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,900
unlivable unmanageable and when someone

2416
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:14,579
can actually hear you and you can

2417
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:16,079
communicate with them that's that's

2418
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:18,779
usually someone you stick with for as

2419
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,340
long as you can I'm trying my best man I

2420
01:44:18,779 --> 01:44:23,939
really don't appreciate you bringing out

2421
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:26,480

2459
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,319
stacking it like if you're just [ __ ]

2460
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,179
stacking it it's gonna happen naturally

2461
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:07,920
right like in some inside's gonna

2462
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:10,679
naturally ferment on the inside yeah

2463
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:13,319
that's it it wasn't intentional yeah

2464

2465
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:17,359
a [ __ ] stuck it's a very scientific it

2466
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,639

um probably the same for you and there

2518
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:42,779
was a thing that happened right around

2519
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:45,060
that end of the era where all these

2520

01:51:27,658 --> 01:51:31,618
Charlie had both

2583
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,159
oh I sent you a picture another

2584
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:37,920
accession I saw that and it looked like

2585
01:51:35,158 --> 01:51:40,079
you know some of the The Very extreme

2586
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,118
femos when you try and grow stuff like

2587
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,760
that indoors they have a very similar

2588
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:47,279
structure but not you know that just

2589
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:48,840
looked so healthy and robust yours it

2590
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:50,819
just looked beautiful grown Outdoors

2591
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,100
like that but it's a the structure

2592
01:51:50,819 --> 01:51:55,259
indoors is really similar you know I

2593
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,699
know guys with phenos like just like

2594
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:58,320
that

2595
01:51:56,698 --> 01:52:02,219
um and it's the good stuff so let's see

2596
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:04,559
mango Beach first time you have seen or

2597
01:52:02,219 --> 01:52:06,840
heard of mango BJ

2598
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,420
okay uh well of course here they

2599
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:13,380
pronounce it [ __ ] Beach but but they

2600
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:15,420
mango biche means uh unripe mango that's

2601
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:17,520
what mango Beach means they sell it on

2602
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:20,719
the street corners

2603
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:24,260
but uh some people call it lemon lemon

2604
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:27,420
lime or something I think

2605
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:30,000
uh Limon something

2606
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:32,100
not my favorite I I don't like it in

2607
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,779
fact I I really don't like it what do

2608
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:35,520
you think it is like what what do you

2609
01:52:33,779 --> 01:52:37,800
think is it normally the same thing or

2610
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,739
is it like stuff that's presented as

2611
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:42,779
Mingo Beach that's or mango BK that's

2612
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:45,000
not the same

2613
01:52:42,779 --> 01:52:47,939
I'm telling you what it is it's very

2614
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,238
intersexed it's long flowering low

2615
01:52:47,939 --> 01:52:53,519
potency uh it's hard to grow it's

2616
01:52:51,238 --> 01:52:56,339
unmanageable it grows in this damn tree

2617
01:52:53,520 --> 01:53:00,840
now that's the ones I've had yeah some

2618
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:03,539
of them I um maybe better oh crap that's

2619
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:05,400
that's a laundry list of undesirable

2620
01:53:03,539 --> 01:53:07,500
traits you just threw out there I think

2621
01:53:05,399 --> 01:53:10,219
that pretty much waves off the entire

2622
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:13,460
world from wanting to pop that pack yeah

2623
01:53:10,219 --> 01:53:16,500
that's dropped to the bottom of the list

2624
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:18,600
[ __ ] beaches just like Punta Rojo it's

2625
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:21,960
a generalized name there's many

2626
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:23,880
varieties within that name yeah and and

2627
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,460
I didn't grow a lot of it remember I I

2628
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,840
got this guy the National University in

2629
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:30,239
Bogota this

2630
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,920
the guy that I smoked him with a dude I

2631
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:33,059
got these [ __ ] boot chains you've got

2632
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:35,279
to grow them out

2633
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,179
they're excellent I grew them out they

2634
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:37,579
were all

2635
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:39,960
[ __ ]

2636
01:53:37,579 --> 01:53:43,019
these weren't these weren't Kai Keys

2637
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:45,840
mango Beach no no no I've never grown

2638
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,820
those okay because I mean you know look

2639
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,500
I mean we may as well consider these

2640
01:53:47,819 --> 01:53:51,319
things to be two completely different

2641
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:53,460
things

2642
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:57,299
and the stuff that the rest of the world

2643
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:59,399
may have access to probably not the same

2644
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:03,539
so I mean you know everything that was

2645
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:03,539
wrong with that mango Beach uh

2646
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:10,440
we should assume that the can of Biogen

2647
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:12,658
Ace people would have uh done their done

2648
01:54:10,439 --> 01:54:15,479
their job and and created selected for

2649
01:54:12,658 --> 01:54:18,059
Less oh absolutely traits yeah yeah yeah

2650
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:20,879
yeah yeah well I don't know if he still

2651
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:23,219
has it I don't even know if if uh uh

2652
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,560
Tyson's still selling shoes but he he

2653
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:27,719
had a punta Rojo and I know where the

2654
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:31,739
Spoonful Rojo came from oh can you talk

2655
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:34,698
about that grown it and it's it is good

2656
01:54:31,738 --> 01:54:34,698
put the Rojo

2657
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,900
yes Punta Rojo he came here uh I forget

2658
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:42,479
I don't know remember what year it was

2659
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:44,519
it was in the 2000s they came here to

2660
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:48,479
Colombian and hooked up with his buddies

2661
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:51,480
went to manazales Gonzalez is a really

2662
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:54,718
unique place an elevation and climate

2663
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:57,899
and everything and uh he sourced the the

2664
01:54:54,719 --> 01:55:01,560
punto Rojo from Manas Hollis or that

2665
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:04,319
area which is also which is also where

2666
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:07,139
the uh wacky weeds some of the wacky

2667
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:08,819
weed manozola's black is from there is

2668
01:55:07,139 --> 01:55:11,600
that what wacky wheat is is man as

2669
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:14,219
always black that's one of them

2670
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:17,699
the original one I believed to have come

2671
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:19,439
from kalka the candy bar and all that's

2672
01:55:17,698 --> 01:55:22,198
another story I got to tell you yes

2673
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,419
please but uh the anyway getting back to

2674
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:28,259
the punto Rojo I've got photos and

2675
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:31,260
everything I grew it in Bogota 2016.

2676
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:34,020
uh but you gotta realize when you're

2677
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:35,760
when you're this this kind of a plant is

2678
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:37,560
different than what you're got and you

2679
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,960
guys it's not a cruise it's not an OG

2680
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:42,719
it's nothing like that it's not a this

2681
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:44,340
is uh it's potent but it's it doesn't

2682
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:46,500
look like it you know what I mean

2683
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:50,159
there's they don't see a lot of Crystal

2684
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:52,679
you know it's not all all uh trichomed

2685
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:55,079
up it's not a big mess

2686
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:57,060
when you open that butt up when you open

2687
01:55:55,079 --> 01:55:59,819
that flower up and start breaking it up

2688
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:01,980
there's these little like sand size

2689
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:04,559
trichomes

2690
01:56:01,979 --> 01:56:07,618
and uh but it's not that it's the flavor

2691
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,960
and of course the flavor all these all

2692
01:56:07,618 --> 01:56:12,599
these variables are in your environment

2693
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:15,118
I I mean you get a lot of it from the

2694
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:17,520
genetics but if you grow it in guano you

2695
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:19,920
get a different taste oh sure yeah if

2696
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:22,560
you grow it in chemical stuff you get a

2697
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:25,500
different taste but it is the real deal

2698
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,239
and and I like it I just don't I I'm not

2699
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,279
growing it right now but I definitely

2700
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:31,618
gonna grow it again because and I have a

2701
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:33,420
bunch of the good seeds from from that

2702
01:56:31,618 --> 01:56:37,139
that's what I was going to ask red is

2703
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:39,719
you know um kaiki uh canobajan Ace

2704
01:56:37,139 --> 01:56:41,340
released multiple versions iterations of

2705
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:45,420
this stuff I believe some of them

2706
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:48,119
outcrossed with other other red uh South

2707
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:49,679
American Central American sativas so I'm

2708
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:51,779
just kind of wondering if you have any

2709
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:54,719
more detail where this might fall on

2710
01:56:51,779 --> 01:56:59,000
that um timeline of of stuff that was

2711
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:59,000
actually released by CBG or Ace

2712
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:05,400
well I believe the Punta Rojo seeds that

2713
01:57:02,939 --> 01:57:07,618
I have and I grew here are the ones that

2714
01:57:05,399 --> 01:57:10,618
in fact I know they are because I helped

2715
01:57:07,618 --> 01:57:12,920
them package the the little what he

2716
01:57:10,618 --> 01:57:15,420
sells them in yeah so it's the original

2717
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:19,020
I have is what is

2718
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:20,760
was it a hot was it a Repro I mean what

2719
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:24,119
you what you've got there are they Repro

2720
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:27,119
seeds is it um you know I it's okay it's

2721
01:57:24,118 --> 01:57:30,179
okay I'm not sure I'm not sure because

2722
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:32,880
he had many things sent from Spain

2723
01:57:30,179 --> 01:57:36,060
yeah many many seeds and things were

2724
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:38,819
even had cuts from Spain he brought cuts

2725
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:40,920
from there yeah but I believe I believe

2726
01:57:38,819 --> 01:57:43,139
these have been worked I don't believe

2727
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:45,359
they're the directly from the bag that

2728
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:47,579
he got the seeds from in Colombia I

2729
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:50,098
think they've they've because there was

2730
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:52,260
no hermaphrodites a girl like 12 of them

2731
01:57:50,099 --> 01:57:54,719
yeah it was true there was three true

2732
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,639
males and I don't know seven females and

2733
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:00,420
they were excellent man I'll show you

2734
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:02,340
the photos wow they're tall colas single

2735
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:04,739
stack rollers

2736
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:07,199
has this kind of uh I don't know it's

2737
01:58:04,738 --> 01:58:08,579
it's like Cedar but it's like a wood

2738
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:11,158
smell

2739
01:58:08,579 --> 01:58:13,800
and it's not exactly Cedar it's more

2740
01:58:11,158 --> 01:58:16,559
like a not Pine either you'd have to

2741
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:19,619
smell it but it's a woody type dark wood

2742
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:21,719
smell it sounds like exactly what we'd

2743
01:58:19,618 --> 01:58:24,539
expect from something named printer Rojo

2744
01:58:21,719 --> 01:58:26,819
right oh it's excellent and of course

2745
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:31,099
you know that just it just means red

2746
01:58:26,819 --> 01:58:33,658
tips red point right right

2747
01:58:31,099 --> 01:58:35,699
and there's another one right what is it

2748
01:58:33,658 --> 01:58:38,759
the uh

2749
01:58:35,698 --> 01:58:40,259
well another one there's there's ones

2750
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:44,340
you know about the United States like

2751
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:46,739
that choco Chiba yeah okay choco is a

2752
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:48,539
department is a department on the

2753
01:58:46,738 --> 01:58:51,479
Pacific coast and it's

2754
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:55,979
it's not suitable for growing cannabis

2755
01:58:51,479 --> 01:58:58,198
it's very humid it's very jungly so

2756
01:58:55,979 --> 01:59:00,959
maybe there was people that said that

2757
01:58:58,198 --> 01:59:03,178
but I've never ever heard of cannabis

2758
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,520
been have been produced there but it may

2759
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:07,020
be I mean it may very well be but I've

2760
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,940
never heard of it

2761
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:11,699
so the the first time I saw that

2762
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:13,919
referenced was in an old article I want

2763
01:59:11,698 --> 01:59:16,859
to say it was R but I I might be wrong

2764
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,899
it was an old article on Colombians

2765
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:21,299
talking about the very first Colombians

2766
01:59:18,899 --> 01:59:24,299
and where they were being pushed out of

2767
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:26,219
and it was I want to say he didn't say

2768
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,139
choco Chiba he just called it Chiba

2769
01:59:26,219 --> 01:59:31,679
Colombian at the time

2770
01:59:28,139 --> 01:59:33,840
I've heard that word before here yeah he

2771
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:38,480
just said Chiba Colombian so I didn't

2772
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,480
know if Chiba was a province or town or

2773
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:44,039
that's just a reference for something

2774
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:47,279
that's good like like uh uh what's the

2775
01:59:44,039 --> 01:59:49,319
other one Primo chimba chimba when

2776
01:59:47,279 --> 01:59:51,118
whenever like something's cool they'll

2777
01:59:49,319 --> 01:59:54,359
say

2778
01:59:51,118 --> 01:59:56,519
gotcha okay it's not Chiba Chiba I've

2779
01:59:54,359 --> 01:59:58,319
heard in reference to cannabis here

2780
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:00,540
very interesting

2781
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:02,340
so yeah so that doesn't even help pin

2782
02:00:00,539 --> 02:00:05,939
down where the province could have been

2783
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:07,260
in relation to yeah but not I remember I

2784
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:08,759
think I remember the article you're

2785
