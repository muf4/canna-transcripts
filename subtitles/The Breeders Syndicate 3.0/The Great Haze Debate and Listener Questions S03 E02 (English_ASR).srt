before we do the episode

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,118
hey it's pretty professional there's all

41
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,798
kinds of cards in here that just that

42
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,239
describe everything it tells you how to

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
go through it

44
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,000
uh lots of tips and tricks

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
cool

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
what's interesting about it is like they

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,719
uh you know they have those kind of

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,479
things for perfumes and like yeah i had

49
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,159
some friends that were studying because

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
i live in wine country right like

51
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,598
studying to be someone yays yeah and in

52
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,519
order to do that

53
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,199
back then like this is like 18 years ago

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,959
or something they would buy these like

55
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,000
thousand dollar kits

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,360
yeah and the aromas were there to teach

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,360
them

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,760
like what an advanced taster was tasting

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
or smelling when they like you know were

60
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,280
talking about merlot or whatever and

61
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,000
they were talking about woodsy notes

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
with hints of raspberry and all that

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,199
they had to be able to like learn the

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,959
language

65
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,479
and so they had like a whole book and

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
all these scents and all this different

67
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,759
stuff and so for terpenes with weed it's

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,479
like

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,959
teaching people how to talk about smell

70
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,959
yeah that's a big part it's a you know

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,598
thing but you can if you can do it too

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,199
and it's probably like most breeders and

73
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,158
weed nerds biggest

74
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,399
weakest weak area yeah i know it is for

75
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,799
me i'm not i'm not a terp expert by any

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
stretch of the imagination no definitely

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
not neither am i you know and neither

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,439
are a lot of our friends yeah

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
you know so i mean there's an aspect

80
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,079
where it's like

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
it's just you just lack the language

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
because you don't encounter how to talk

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,920
about that language

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,318
anywhere yeah really

85
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,719
terpenes and like wine sommeliers it's

86
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,079
all about using your eyebrows

87
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,799
and like

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,920
and your eyes to express

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,360
yeah you know i mean it it uh

90
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,958
it's and then it's okay and then it's

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,040
all relative to that human being's

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,000
ability to taste

93
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,158
yeah

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,039
i have i have a really bad sense of

95
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,359
smell

96
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,199
so my taste is really off too you know

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,840
like the whole the whole shebang sucks

98
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,199
up upstairs here in this region right

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,438
yeah the whole

100
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,759
everything everything in this region is

101
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,560
sucking

102
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,840
we're slowly climbing up there yeah yeah

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
it's weird when i have to do it on this

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,759
[ __ ] account like most people don't

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
know to follow it even though i said it

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,518
so hopefully still

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,879
shadow band or whatever on the other one

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,239
from doing live

109
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,719
i checked it this morning and it was

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,639
like nope you cannot do lives

111
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:22,478
oh man yeah well it is what it is

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,079
it is what it is i'm used to it by now

113
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,159
but yeah no people should we're gonna do

114
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,159
a whole episode i'm not exactly sure

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,320
when but we're going to have our our

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,880
buddy crybaby on and he

117
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,000
has a lot of knowledge and language

118
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,918
around aromas terpenes scents

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,639
what causes smells what are the

120
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,560
components of it and he'll be able to

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,478
speak a lot more intelligently than

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,319
either matt or i can

123
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,360
uh yeah i think you know

124
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,040
so uh that'll be soon i hope

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,439
he was the one that was uh first telling

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,000
me to stop calling skunky [ __ ] terps i

127
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,600
was like oops yeah they're like theol's

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and like yeah but what's interesting

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
about that is even like the uh and we're

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
like rambling for a while waiting for

131
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,519
people to show up but even

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
what's interesting about you know the

133
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,639
thing about theolos and stuff is how

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
they're volatile

135
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,879
yeah right where terpenes are longer

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,959
lasting and i would always notice about

137
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,639
the old super skunk that i had

138
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,319
that the last two or three weeks before

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,478
harvest and the first month after

140
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,719
cutting it it was just rank

141
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,639
yeah but if you kept it long enough even

142
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,080
if and you know in a nice jar in the

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
dark or whatever it would eventually

144
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,319
just kind of turn into generic green bud

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,240
did you find that the more it kept its

146
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,800
moisture content the longer it lasted in

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
the morning as it oh yeah certainly yeah

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
it was actually kind of tough because it

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,520
was one of those nugs that you were like

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,000
it was famous for like looking dense but

151
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,240
weighing light yeah yeah you put this

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,519
thing that you think was like a huge nug

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,840
and you're like oh man this thing's

154
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,959
massive and it's like 2.8 grams

155
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,439
yeah it just it had like but it had

156
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,839
really good like air to air to bud ratio

157
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,478
so it burned really well yeah cherry ink

158
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,279
is very similar usually snappers of it

159
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,519
uh some bud like like kush's especially

160
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,119
and a lot of this cookie [ __ ] um you

161
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,279
really have to cure it right to get it

162
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
to burn well yeah

163
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,359
you know um but but

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,879
uh you know super skunk you could burn

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
that like pretty quick

166
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,680
because it just had like a good amount

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,759
of air

168
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,918
it sounds like denali saved that cut

169
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
from uh panda

170
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,120
oh that's good yeah i'm real stoked

171
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,000
about that

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,840
so we're up over we're 100 and 810

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
people maybe we could start chatting

174
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,159
yeah do you want to answer a few

175
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
questions first and then maybe it'll get

176
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,520
up higher a little bit yeah i haven't

177
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,359
even [ __ ] looked to be honest i've

178
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,560
just been bullshitting

179
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,199
um someone just asked about mango haze i

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,240
could talk about mango haze there you go

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,439
mango

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,319
mango haze is like a super nice um

183
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,839
line from shanti baba and neville

184
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,199
it's uh nl5 haze by skunk haze it's a

185
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,918
sister to super silver haze and it uses

186
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,879
this famous cut called the 122 or the

187
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,799
mango which is like my favorite nl5 haze

188
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,639
cut and it's still alive over there i

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,840
think it's still shown in coffee shops

190
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,319
and uh johnsy has it apparently

191
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,399
um yeah but yeah it's it's a little bit

192
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,680
more hazy it's a little it's a little

193
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,198
like it's got a little bit more of the

194
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,759
flavors that i like it's got less

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,680
terpenoline than super silver haze it

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,639
doesn't tend to yield as much

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439
um

198
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,000
but uh but it's a super nice plant and i

199
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,038
think it's likely one of the ones where

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,038
he still has the right parents yeah i

201
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,079
can't say for nobody can say for sure

202
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,079
but i think

203
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,079
people still find really nice plants in

204
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,159
that line yeah they do

205
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,560
so it's not just a there is a clone only

206
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
mango haze too i believe i don't know if

207
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
it's from the same seed line but i know

208
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,318
miami mango has that one and it's it's

209
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
like uh terpenoline and mango it's it's

210
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
it's one of my favorites it's like uh

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,680
i've seen some tests on it and it's

212
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,240
terpene content it's pretty off the

213
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,759
charts yeah it's pretty high

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,160
um and uh yeah so that's mango haze it's

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
kind of mango haze and super silver and

216
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,240
neville's haze are kind of like the

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,720
final three hazes that came out

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,759
yeah at the end of like one whole era

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
you know

220
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
so that's starting at the end not the

221
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,279
beginning

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,879
but um

223
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,878
you know uh let's see

224
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
skunk haze a lot of people in europe

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,199
don't like the skunk cases quite as much

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,199
because they felt the skunk aspects kind

227
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,560
of overpowered the

228
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,639
um the haze like the more delicate haze

229
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,158
aspects that they liked uh that's why

230
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,838
they were always kind of looking for

231
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,360
like bland indicas to cross it to

232
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,839
yeah to allow you know they kind of

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,039
wanted like very little terp

234
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
cuts

235
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,039
to blend it too to see if the haze terps

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
would come through

237
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,679
so

238
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,000
um

239
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,639
anyway i don't know uh we're gonna we're

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,679
gonna chat about haze tonight which is a

241
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,679
super controversial subject so

242
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,399
a disclaimer this is just kind of like

243
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,519
our opinion on it and like what we see

244
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,600
um

245
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,600
in the forum days when things got

246
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
started some of the longest running

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
threads ever

248
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,000
were arguments between all these old

249
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,000
timers over haze

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
on cannabis world on overgrow probably

251
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
on icmag

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,039
it would just go sometimes it would go

253
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,039
into the hundreds of pages

254
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,519
yeah of people battling back and forth

255
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,919
over what was the real haze story

256
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,120
like one of my good friends over on mr

257
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,559
nice did probably what i think was the

258
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,519
best

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,319
uh

260
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,320
treat us on haze like overview on haze

261
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,680
during that time before any anybody else

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
had really been able to track down

263
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,519
anyone to talk to it was my friend

264
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,719
bigger or um off mr nice i see there's

265
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,000
someone with that name in here but i

266
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,360
don't think it's the same dude it would

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,600
be awesome if i remember him mr nice for

268
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,159
sure bird was a cool dude

269
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
i haven't seen him in a long time though

270
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,919
so i don't know if he's still hanging

271
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,799
around or what the deal is but he if you

272
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,159
i think it's still up on mr nice and for

273
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,319
the most part i know it's been

274
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,838
considered one of the more accurate

275
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
histories on it

276
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
um but there was some stuff we dug up in

277
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,159
the past few years i know bodhi found a

278
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,560
book um

279
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,519
about santa cruz or written in santa

280
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,439
cruz

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
and santa cruz history and it actually

282
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
mentions a few of them by name and it's

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
one of the first things we found where

284
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
there were other names in it

285
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,838
you know full names

286
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
i mean so there's an aspect where

287
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,560
like uh you know hayes has a history

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,600
dating back to like the late 60s early

289
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,919
70s yeah so it's hard enough to decipher

290
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,000
stuff that happened 15 or 20 years ago

291
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,919
uh much less 40.

292
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
so there's a lot of

293
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,879
forgive me hazy stuff around the origins

294
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,440
of it and on those threads there's tons

295
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,879
of arguing that's going on yeah there's

296
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,200
tons of arguing

297
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,439
um and there's you know uh

298
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,959
sam skunk man has his version

299
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
and you know he's posted under different

300
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,039
names about things he claims to have

301
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,518
been a neighbor to those guys

302
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,159
um but i think what's fairly well

303
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,440
accepted is it started out as colombian

304
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,958
by colombia

305
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,720
yeah

306
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,879
i think we could start there it was

307
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,278
colombian by colombian

308
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,919
from import weed and they grew it in

309
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,958
greenhouses in santa cruz and areas that

310
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,479
were mild like that

311
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,679
because you needed those mild

312
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
temperatures

313
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,599
in order to take it till december or

314
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,879
january or whatever the hell it was that

315
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
they pulled it down

316
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,399
yeah um they hadn't figured out depths

317
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
or anything like that yet and so it got

318
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,240
pretty famous

319
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,239
um i know matt has a poster somewhere of

320
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
it um it got

321
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,278
early on got named and got kind of

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,078
legendary

323
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,078
um you know it was sold high-end in new

324
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,120
york i believe

325
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,679
um

326
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,519
for you know uh quite a bit at the time

327
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,559
yeah it was considered like the super

328
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,639
connoisseur weed right yeah i would say

329
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,319
all this is pretty like standard and not

330
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
argued about that much

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,839
yeah that much that much it's it's

332
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,759
considered to be correct i think that

333
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
that much is considered one once you get

334
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,399
into like who's responsible for what and

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,639
what happened when and how and all that

336
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,879
that's where it gets kind of dicey yeah

337
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
um but basically what seems like and

338
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,078
there's a lot of stuff where you read

339
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,839
online where it'll talk about like it's

340
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:25,519
a colombian by indian by thai by mexican

341
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,160
um you know uh

342
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
sam swears that it's colo by colo

343
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,439
yeah

344
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
you know and all that stuff was added

345
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
way later

346
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,638
and isn't really part of it i remember

347
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,799
yeah he said the indian was added way

348
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,879
later if at all i don't remember was

349
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,639
that his claim or not i think he said

350
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,399
that the indian was in there but it was

351
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
like it was added as the separate

352
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,958
hybrids he offered

353
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,519
and never got mixed in with the

354
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,759
you know with the core with the core

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
amount of hate so we always had separate

356
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,759
haze

357
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,759
yeah so

358
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,879
you know when it really boils down to it

359
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,278
or whatever it just seems like haze was

360
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,278
you know a mix of colombian

361
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,439
strains or whatever that they got out of

362
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,399
seeds from import yeah and they got

363
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,000
lucky

364
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,759
and admittedly it doesn't seem like they

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,679
knew what the hell they were doing

366
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,519
yeah you know um

367
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,759
and it got pretty famous and so there's

368
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,360
a lot of stories and a lot of mystery

369
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,319
between

370
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,800
late 60s and mid 80s

371
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,040
there's stories out of santa cruz

372
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,278
um there's a series of brothers they

373
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,559
wrote some stuff and high top like

374
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,039
there's all these various things and

375
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,879
and uh you know

376
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,039
there they've been debated ad nauseum

377
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,198
other places so maybe we don't need to

378
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,838
like delve into that part because you

379
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,799
can find that everywhere but what is

380
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,480
part of it is that what's indisputable

381
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,159
is that in 84

382
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,720
84ish or so

383
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,759
um sam skunk man brought it to

384
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
holland

385
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,720
yeah

386
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,198
right so

387
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,278
these guys grew haze it got famous

388
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,240
um they were growing it in santa cruz

389
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,838
area uh it was a mix of sativas uh

390
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,919
mostly colombian

391
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,000
it was getting sold in new york and then

392
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,719
at some point sam took a version of it

393
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,759
to

394
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
holland

395
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,120
yes

396
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,719
and as far as we can tell

397
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,320
he um

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,320
you know he gave it to three people

399
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,680
right

400
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,320
yeah that's what yeah yeah he gave it to

401
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,239
uh uh positronics

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,040
who he actually worked with

403
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,480
yeah

404
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,879
and he gave it to corel from uh

405
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
super sativa seed club yep uh that

406
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,919
carell talked about when we interviewed

407
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,839
him and he gave it to neville yep

408
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:46,000
and um all three all three of those guys

409
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,720
made hybrids with it

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,278
and sold seeds

411
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
um from that and pretty much all haze

412
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,000
that we can really

413
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,599
we can really trace uh comes from either

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,480
those three people

415
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,320
or stock that made that sam made himself

416
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,680
in amsterdam later

417
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,399
yeah off seats he kept for himself

418
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,078
and we really don't have any verified

419
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,039
american

420
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,399
haze do we

421
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,319
yeah

422
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,919
i mean we have we have the originator

423
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
that we all agree i think everybody

424
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,919
agrees that lund was a part of it

425
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,600
um debatable on the the lady kathy yeah

426
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,958
it's debatable we don't have i'm just

427
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,199
gonna say first name since it doesn't

428
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,518
really neither here nor dare but um

429
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,159
there is one guy who keeps all the

430
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,039
posters and as he explained it to me

431
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,000
was that the posters were hung up in the

432
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,519
dealer's houses that were verified legit

433
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,879
haze dealers and that's kind of how they

434
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,639
verified if they were getting real haze

435
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,679
or not if that poster was in their room

436
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,278
then they knew that they were getting

437
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,958
legit hey there so that's how he told it

438
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,720
now if it's true or not i don't know but

439
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,239
he seems to have the lion's share of the

440
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,560
original posters

441
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
and he got them somehow

442
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,559
yeah

443
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
somehow

444
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,119
yeah

445
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,320
so

446
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
you know and then like a lot of those

447
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
things like

448
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,720
not everybody

449
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,319
not everybody involved

450
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,360
uh probably has told their story

451
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,879
publicly yeah by any means yeah and so

452
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,639
and you know there's a few people that

453
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,879
are loud about it that insist they know

454
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,079
what's going on and but what we know is

455
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,320
it made it there

456
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,319
yeah it made it to amsterdam and

457
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,879
everybody's all the stuff that made haze

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,120
famous sort of came from amsterdam back

459
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,120
to america yeah

460
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,078
i would say yeah

461
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,759
wouldn't you yeah i think yeah it didn't

462
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,838
it wasn't like haze popped up here and

463
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,120
kept rocking and everybody's rocking a

464
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,560
cut from here

465
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,399
so what we don't know is it seems like

466
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,000
you know when we interviewed corel from

467
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
super saint eva seed club he gave us a

468
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,559
pretty interesting tidbit

469
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,160
and that uh sam only he didn't think sam

470
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,958
had that many seeds of it because he

471
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,958
only gave him like 10. yeah

472
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,838
and he thought that he only gave neville

473
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,439
some

474
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,279
devil disputes that

475
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,720
um but be that as it may um

476
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,000
you know uh

477
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,679
um

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,240
neville ended up probably making the

479
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,199
most famous hybrids with it

480
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
by far

481
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
yeah by far

482
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
you could say that you know um but

483
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,720
positronics had it as well original and

484
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,400
so did uh super sativa c club yeah

485
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,838
they all had originals and it seems like

486
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
when you read the stories about what

487
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,318
neville and all the rest of them did

488
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,679
is that uh they were kind of like us

489
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,678
growing you know it's kind of like the

490
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,360
sour that you know a lot of the starting

491
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,400
stories it was like a bunch of kids that

492
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,599
were young

493
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
that didn't know what the [ __ ] they were

494
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,759
doing at all

495
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
and they made a bunch of rookie mistakes

496
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,119
yeah because they weren't used to

497
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,000
growing something that took 22 weeks or

498
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,239
whatever and it was a jungle plant and

499
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,599
you know and it seems like a number of

500
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,359
them got lost

501
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,319
yeah by everybody

502
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,918
accidents didn't you know mom got killed

503
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,000
they didn't think it was worth much it

504
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,280
took you know 25 weeks and never

505
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,919
finished

506
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,079
um you know that kind of thing and so

507
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,759
um they didn't realize what kind of gold

508
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,079
they had

509
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,160
i don't know not at the time

510
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,319
so much hindsight needed for that yeah

511
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,558
they had they had no idea so neville

512
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,079
neville had you know a few males and a

513
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,440
few females that he burned through and

514
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,480
didn't keep

515
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,440
um

516
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,839
before he you know he ended up i mean he

517
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,279
ended up only by 1990 he only had one

518
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,199
plant that had lived

519
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,720
yeah

520
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,759
you know um

521
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,079
and so

522
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,079
someone keeps asking did sam get invited

523
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,599
sam's never wanted to come on the show

524
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,079
so no

525
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,798
i mean outside to be honest that's why i

526
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,480
i said at first like if you want to hear

527
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,679
sam's opinion about it

528
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,599
um there you could go hunt on overgrow

529
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,759
you know archives or something or

530
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,759
anything like that like he's posted

531
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,160
a ton

532
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,400
on his opinion about it it's there's not

533
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,840
a shortage of sam's written history

534
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
that's why we didn't focus on it for

535
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,918
that long

536
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,799
um you know he disagreed with me on the

537
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,400
uh kathy part so he said that the grand

538
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,079
daddy mike was incorrect on that

539
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,679
you know that that's that's what he said

540
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,918
and it might be true you know so yeah

541
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,919
that's what little i know from him after

542
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,080
i told the story the last time based on

543
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
granddaddy mike um that's the one thing

544
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,678
that he had he said it was it was very

545
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:27,279
good but that's not correct so but from

546
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,880
the the reason why we kind of glossed

547
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,480
over that part is that it's the hardest

548
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
part to talk about because it's the

549
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,400
least documented yeah you know and it's

550
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,759
a bunch of history from a bunch of

551
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,919
people doing some black marketing

552
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,759
illegal [ __ ] in america yeah all trying

553
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,600
to stay under the radar and as far as um

554
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,599
as far as the uh

555
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,759
you know the haze goes and everybody

556
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,199
knows hayes what we just mentioned

557
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,558
positronics

558
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,360
uh neville's stuff and super sativa seed

559
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,399
club and sam are the sources

560
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,719
yeah

561
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
that all the haze that we talk about now

562
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,519
descends from

563
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,600
yeah that's where that's where it all

564
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,158
comes from it's either hybrids they made

565
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,319
or descendants of it or whatever and all

566
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,400
the companies like the flying dutchman

567
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,038
or any of these different groups seeds

568
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,480
men that sold pure haze

569
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,720
i believe they were all just buying

570
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
kilos wholesale from sam

571
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,159
yeah i don't know i'd love to be able to

572
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,839
ask him for sure but it sounds like he

573
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,280
was doing a lot of reselling like that

574
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,439
yeah i mean he basically what it sounds

575
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,440
like is to not get in trouble

576
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,600
uh he didn't sell directly to anyone

577
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,600
outside of holland because seed sales

578
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,240
within holland were legal

579
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:37,199
yeah so he was willing to wholesale um

580
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,319
but he wasn't willing to retail yeah

581
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,319
so he ended up working through

582
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,480
positronics he ended up i mean that's

583
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,000
how i mean you know it's funny when

584
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,240
people talk about all this like rare

585
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,159
skunk one that used to exist

586
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,759
and we asked corel about it he just

587
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,080
laughed and he said everyone gets skunk

588
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,839
one from you know buying bags of seed

589
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,798
from sam stuckman

590
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,959
yeah

591
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,079
that's where you got your skunk one

592
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,159
yeah

593
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,199
right

594
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
santa cruz but getting back to hayes

595
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,960
it's

596
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,119
someone asked about the ac tase related

597
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,038
to santa cruz original haze um i was

598
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,239
just going to say that's that's by old

599
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,879
testament one who was british so

600
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
i really highly doubt it was sourced via

601
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,640
santa cruz

602
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,359
this is just my my theory on it um it

603
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,919
yeah i mean i think i think they sourced

604
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,879
it through pozzi maybe yeah i don't know

605
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,440
who who i i know tom hill's haze line

606
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
was positronic yeah his was and it was

607
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,400
his was very different from the old

608
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,798
timer hayes yeah so you know um oh yeah

609
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,559
all tom hill's work and stuff and the

610
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,319
deep chunk hybrids and all that stuff

611
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,279
about positronics

612
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,439
um

613
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,359
they uh

614
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,919
um that was all from

615
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,918
for a while there sam worked with on

616
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,759
some fashion at pozzi

617
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,280
yeah um helping them breed and do

618
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,879
working with werner and stuff like that

619
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,599
and helping them breed different stuff

620
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,240
and and working lines and positronix was

621
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,558
just one of those early seed companies

622
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,359
um you know when sam first moved to

623
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,279
amsterdam he was looking for connections

624
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,399
people to sell seeds to and people to

625
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,319
work with

626
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
yeah and he kind of ended up dealing

627
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,359
with everyone in town

628
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,360
but that was only like a few dudes yeah

629
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,719
that was really like ongoing then or

630
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,719
whatever right

631
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,279
and positronics also like a lot of

632
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,240
people don't know this part but um the

633
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,480
positronics haze 19 skunk one is what

634
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
gave birth and is the same thing as the

635
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,960
metal haze that i think bodhi just

636
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,720
released f3s of so if you do want like a

637
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,840
worked version of that line that's a

638
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,839
very good way to get it

639
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,599
so i don't know i've never heard numbers

640
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,599
until the corel interview but corel

641
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,399
swore that like

642
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,279
uh pozzi him neville they only got like

643
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,960
a handful like 10 seeds each yeah yeah

644
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,119
the first time i heard that too and then

645
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,200
um and then sam held the rest back that

646
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,038
he had for himself to make his own open

647
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,919
pollination that he did later

648
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,679
yeah

649
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,640
um but i you know i'd never heard that

650
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
before

651
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,280
um but then you know corel was there and

652
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,359
we weren't so exactly yeah uh you know

653
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,678
uh neville's dead now but he claims he

654
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,038
got big bags of old-ass seat

655
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,880
but only got

656
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,359
you know eight or ten of them to pop out

657
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,960
of the entire thing yeah

658
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,558
you know um

659
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,240
you know and uh

660
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,918
so

661
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,000
anyway they um

662
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,720
you know he comes in mid 80s or whatever

663
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,440
he comes here and and he comes he comes

664
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,759
from california to holland and he sells

665
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,919
hays seeds to multiple different people

666
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,400
and starts working himself and that was

667
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,480
the start of hayes becoming famous yeah

668
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
um and it really didn't for at first

669
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,640
even like the very first thing that

670
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,278
saint that uh neville offered was

671
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,038
actually a northern lights crossed to a

672
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,159
female hazy hat

673
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,000
yeah

674
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,080
that was year one so there was like this

675
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,480
haze b that was a girl

676
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,399
and it was nl1 haze b

677
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,558
um and then the next year he came out

678
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,919
with nl5 hates

679
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,720
i didn't even know that i don't think i

680
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,960
knew that part about the b girl yeah

681
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
yeah yeah if you go look in the in the

682
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,640
88 catalog

683
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,799
um he has i think it's actually an

684
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,919
nl1 by rudor alice

685
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,400
hybrid and he crossed it to haze b

686
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,880
um and he talked about it being female

687
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,640
because he was like trying to to like

688
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,840
tame the the crazy lead time to flower

689
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,480
it yeah

690
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,199
right calling you out someone's saying

691
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,200
you're incorrect

692
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,278
i'm sure about what

693
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,558
i don't know i don't know

694
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,159
how sure

695
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,759
am i on it i don't know i mean we could

696
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,400
i got i got the

697
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,278
catalogs around here but he

698
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,440
the the first two hybrids he really he

699
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,319
he really tried to make was uh

700
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,200
um he crossed it to maple leaf afghan

701
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,240
tea

702
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,480
and uh he crossed it to um

703
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,640
uh nl5 hayes

704
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,839
okay and nl5 hayes he re he he released

705
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,038
um

706
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,639
uh the other one i don't think he

707
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,200
released to the public but he gave to

708
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,480
friends or whatnot it is a big herb is

709
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,278

00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,678
on uh mr nice

714
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,679
i've been looking for i've been actually

715
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,640
looking for big herb for quite a while

716
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,120
that's cool

717
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,880
i'm glad you showed up yeah so i mean he

718
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,719
you know um one of the cool things about

719
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,320
mr nice is that

720
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,600
um there was a time in 09 you know 2010

721
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,960
or something where neville was very

722
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,439
active on there

723
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,400
yeah and a ton of knowledge about what

724
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,558
happened

725
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,679
uh dropped both publicly and posts that

726
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,839
he made and via dm and communications

727
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,360
with various people that were active

728
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,519
at the time yeah um on mr nice and big

729
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,000
herb was definitely one of those guys

730
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,319
um that was active in communication and

731
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,240
like matt said he had a great write-up

732
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,240
on the history of it

733
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
that you can probably still go read

734
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,919
yeah herb was around when when when

735
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,600
neville came back and i started getting

736
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,000
[ __ ] around with him and trying to

737
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,158
work the bubbas and all that [ __ ]

738
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and uh it kind of petered off on the mr

739
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,320
nice forums after that it really really

740
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,599
took a dive after all that [ __ ] yeah so

741
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,678
somebody just asked a question which

742
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,599
i'll answer just because it ties in

743
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,519
uh they were asking did neville have

744
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,759
both an a and a c male and did he use

745
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,079
them to breed in various things

746
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,319
um so what it sounds like

747
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,519
uh is that neville ended up with two

748
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,480
guys

749
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:43,278
right yeah and uh the a and the a and

750
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,839
the c right and

751
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,000
it was easier to use the males because

752
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,319
it was easier to collect pollen and then

753
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,960
dust a bunch of indica females at the

754
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,439
appropriate time than it was to try to

755
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,880
deal with the females i guess yeah so

756
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,480
for lack of a better way he ended up

757
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,000
with a couple boys

758
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,798
and um

759
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,798
the

760
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,599
uh the a

761
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,839
he lost in 1989 he did a huge seat

762
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:11,038
increase and put all of his best indicas

763
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,038
in there like the g13 and the nl5 and a

764
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,720
bunch of different stuff and then

765
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
him and his workers forgot to keep a

766
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,278
backup in the bedroom

767
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,440
yeah so he bloomed every a male and they

768
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,880
all died and he lost it

769
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,720
so after that

770
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,320
happened so often keeping big libraries

771
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
too

772
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,359
so he never sold any commercial he never

773
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,120
sold any commercial amounts of haze yeah

774
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,798
he popped them himself and gave out

775
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,918
various phenos of it which we'll get to

776
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,759
in a little bit

777
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,840
and he might he gave some private

778
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,119
amounts of seed to friends

779
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,639
um other breeders uh people early on you

780
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,158
know what not but

781
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
it was never sold commercially so

782
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,399
everything you ever could buy

783
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,879
commercially

784
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:54,239
was the sea dad

785
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,559
so all nl5 has all nl5 haze that you

786
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,000
could buy from the seed bank or from

787
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,000
scentsy seeds was the c dad

788
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,798
right and that's so that's kind of like

789
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,398
what

790
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,000
everybody's got

791
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,000
yeah i'd bring big herb on the live i

792
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,079
don't know if he's ready to just beat

793
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,240
pop on on camera all of a sudden but

794
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,918
he's more than welcome to come on

795
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,359
it's no but uh we'll read we'll

796
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,080
definitely reach out to you after the

797
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:21,038
show he's a wealth of knowledge yeah and

798
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,199
would be cool to add to things but um

799
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,679
you know so neville

800
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,159
neville had and nl5 hayes was probably

801
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,320
the most famous it's probably what put

802
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,120
hayes on the map to be perfectly honest

803
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,439
yeah

804
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,119
uh and what i mean by that is that it it

805
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,519
just made it a permanent part of

806
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,719
cannabis lore yeah it inundated the

807
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:44,158
united states it did and he you know in

808
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,038
89 and 90 the pictures on the front of

809
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,799
his catalog or an nl5 haze a

810
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,599
yeah uh huge running colas big bud you

811
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,558
know

812
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,719
all that and it was that and super skunk

813
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,278
ended up being him and scentsy's

814
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,000
best-selling seed lines

815
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,278
so nl5 hayes kind of changed the game

816
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,880
and um

817
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,599
it was super potent

818
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,200
and it's probably i've said it on shows

819
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,278
with matt before in my opinion it's

820
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,399
probably the most successful hybrid ever

821
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,480
made

822
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,479
i wonder if it's because like

823
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,159
the line was kicking out more

824
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,399
keepers you know things that people

825
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,480
wanted or just because so many were sold

826
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,918
you were eventually gonna find a keeper

827
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,360
because it wasn't super easy to find

828
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,600
keepers in all those packs was it i

829
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,839
never found a [ __ ] keeper yeah and i

830
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,000
bought i definitely i bought plenty of

831
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,079
packs yeah not plenty but i mean i

832
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,880
probably bought seven or eight packs in

833
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,398
the in the in the mid-90s

834
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,720
but then other people from that same

835
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,479
year and same era as me uh there's

836
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,079
things that are still traded today that

837
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,240
were found right around then

838
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,319
yeah so it's just the mis it's just the

839
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,720
mystery of seeds you can find it in one

840
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:54,240
and you can you might not find it in 200

841
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,720
yeah in a way you know um but it seems

842
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,159
like that that strain was consistent

843
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,278
from somewhere to 89 to the mid 90s

844
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,840
yeah uh neville says they lost the nl5

845
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,839
mom before he left scentsy which was in

846
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,839
95-96

847
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,558
um but

848
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,480
and and basically like all the all the

849
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,839
haze that we know of all the phenos that

850
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,919
have been kept

851
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,038
all seemed to trace back to that late

852
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,880
80s through mid 90s era yeah

853
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,359
and there's a [ __ ] yeah and there's a

854
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,440
[ __ ] bunch of them

855
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,319
right there's a shitload i mean some

856
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,640
that may not even be identified as nl5

857
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,119
hayes like bull rider might be nl5haze

858
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,720
based you know yeah old betsy yeah

859
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,239
exactly the sister of bull rider or

860
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,720
whatever but yeah

861
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,079
so what ends up happening is that

862
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,720
um maybe we can like uh

863
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,079
you know that's interesting uh big herb

864
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,038
because we've always wondered there's

865
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,119
been a rumor that the cuban black

866
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:56,158
could have been from gifted seeds to

867
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,158
someone that neville knew

868
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,158
you know and it could be it could have

869
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,240
been a in that case um

870
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,519
but i've heard that rumor too i don't

871
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,558
know if it's true

872
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,000
um but uh i poo poo the cuban black i

873
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,759
don't give a [ __ ] what anyone says like

874
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,798
the at least the clones circulating

875
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,558
right now

876
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,918
in the community because i knew exactly

877
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,319
who brought it in and that dude kept

878
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,278
[ __ ] lying about everything he had so

879
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,158
i think it's very i'm very skeptical

880
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,759
skeptical with what uh

881
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,600
with what goes around today as a human

882
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,558
black case it might be some kind of l5

883
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,879
phase but it is not the original i know

884
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,319
what what you know i mean we can you

885
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,000
know we're bouncing around and i

886
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,639
apologize because it's like a

887
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,679
multi-decade story or whatever but yeah

888
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,679
basically

889
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,278
uh and we can dive into different parts

890
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,720
at different times but

891
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:48,000
um basically between you know 89 and and

892
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,798
95 or so there's probably like

893
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,278
uh

894
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,918
10 or 15 elites

895
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,079
maybe a few more yeah that have survived

896
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,759
from that era that are all named cuts

897
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,678
and still held on to

898
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,759
yeah um of

899
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,320
mostly nl5 haze

900
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,679
um whether it uses the a dad or the c

901
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,639
dad but some g13 haze some hash plant

902
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,120
haze

903
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,038
um various different things

904
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:16,079
yeah you know i've only ever had the

905
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,079
hash plant haze and hybrids

906
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,918
they um so basically yeah neville

907
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,759
basically crossed it to like all his

908
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,519
best indicates

909
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,480
yeah so it got crossed the hash plant it

910
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,640
got crossed to g13 it got across to nl5

911
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,000
it got crossed to nl1

912
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,159
uh anything that he had that was an

913
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,278
indica that he thought was a bomb clone

914
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,080
yeah

915
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,919
uh got you know so so that's kind of

916
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,439
where like people are talking piff isn't

917
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,038
one thing all this we'll get to that in

918
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,600
a second but basically what happened is

919
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,960
is that there's a whole series we can

920
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:49,439
talk about of famous clones in europe

921
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,399
that neville hunted and found and then

922
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,399
passed out to france yeah and those got

923
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,398
those got held and like some people call

924
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:59,359
them the southern the i almost said

925
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,439
southern humble the southern holland

926
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,158
south holland crew

927
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,798
yeah south holland crew um and they've

928
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,880
been sold in coffee shops for decades

929
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,759
yeah when i when i first went you know

930
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,480
to coffee shops in in amsterdam you

931
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:17,119
could get nl5h8 you could get a5 you

932
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,880
could get c5 you could get g13 you could

933
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,119
get hash plant haze

934
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,960
basically every every trip i went

935
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,918
somewhere had

936
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,679
you know various versions of it yeah so

937
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,038
they were sold and a lot of people came

938
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,640
to holland to smoke those hazes

939
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,319
so there was these famous cuts and

940
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,240
there's a lot of them that are 30 years

941
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,519
old now or whatever that got

942
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,038
um

943
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,278
that got saved in europe and there's

944
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,720
like a whole map to that and then at the

945
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,079
same time

946
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,839
there was a bunch of people that were

947
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,558
trading seeds with neville

948
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,798
uh and buying a bunch of neville seeds

949
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,359
and it seems like a combination of new

950
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:56,319
york and florida

951
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,798
right um it blew up and got super

952
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,398
popular yeah and there was markets for

953
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,319
it a lot of the people in florida were

954
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,879
actually sending it to new york

955
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,839
because it blew up in new york and

956
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,838
got a top dollar and there's rumors

957
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,159
that it's been kind of a thing in new

958
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,679
york since the 70s

959
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,000
like there's always been a high-end

960
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,918
clientele of like wall street brokers

961
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,760
musicians artists

962
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,480
connected people that are willing to

963
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,000
drop big money for haze yeah

964
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
as long as i've been a smoker you could

965
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,159
go to new york and find hayes yeah i

966
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,079
wonder why that is

967
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,679
it just caught on and never

968
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,560
i don't know

969
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,639
um but like i wonder why dominican cruz

970
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,480
picked up on it new york i wonder why

971
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,599
certain ethnic you know

972
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,159
groups just

973
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,838
navigated to that specific type is it

974
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,159
that new yorkers just tend to like more

975
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,239
speedy weed you know i mean

976
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,039
in in this case the best haze in the

977
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,678
world in my opinion is in amsterdam

978
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,159
and you know new york and florida

979
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,480
yeah the west coast gets jacked

980
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,358
like we literally we get jack and super

981
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,519
silver haze and uh you know like we get

982
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,279
a lot of hybrids of that kind of thing

983
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,559
and those are more like the poly hybrids

984
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
that came later

985
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,440
yeah right like uh you know they on the

986
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,480
east coast they have a bunch of f1s and

987
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,599
s1s of f1s and you know and there's a

988
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,199
people are going to talk about it you

989
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,240
know there's people talk about names

990
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,519
like heights hayes downtown brown

991
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,719
uh pith

992
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,320
church

993
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:28,319
uh cuban black um you know it seems like

994
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,200
there was groups of dominicans and

995
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,519
groups of cubans that had it on lockdown

996
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,039
yeah you know people call it block work

997
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,559
uh because they could get it on the

998
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,000
block there was green haze there was

999
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,880
brown haze

1000
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,119
right

1001
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,320
yeah and it's really hard if you're not

1002
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,640
from there

1003
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,359
to know all the different

1004
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,279
you know are they phenos are they the

1005
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,000
same thing grown different ways are they

1006
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,680
called different hybrid names is i mean

1007
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
i i talked to some people that were in

1008
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,799
the know

1009
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
and i used to think that it was like you

1010
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,760
know half a dozen names from the same

1011
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,800
couple cuts

1012
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,119
yeah

1013
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,039
but it turns out that in the 30 years

1014
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,920
that hayes has been popular in new york

1015
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,800
and florida there's a [ __ ] plethora

1016
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,639
yeah

1017
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,640
there's even there's like poo day that's

1018
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,000
another one i always wondered what that

1019
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,960
stood for

1020
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,800
this is a weird word yeah i mean there's

1021
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,159
all kinds of nicknames and stuff and so

1022
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,119
yeah what's crazy about the haze is that

1023
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,480
the

1024
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,000
and don't take any offense to this

1025
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,760
anyone but like the cubans and the

1026
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,519
dominicans and whoever that were running

1027
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,760
it they viewed it very much so as a

1028
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,559
business yeah and they held that [ __ ]

1029
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,119
[ __ ] type they weren't into into

1030
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,199
sharing it with trading they had like a

1031
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,720
market and their market was good and

1032
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,559
they were into it and there's dudes that

1033
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,879
i've talked to that like their entire

1034
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,159
career basically just grown hays

1035
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,599
yeah

1036
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,838
you know that's all they needed to do

1037
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,440
was grow hays get it to new york boom

1038
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,480
they're good right so they don't share

1039
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,720
that [ __ ]

1040
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,440
so but what's interesting about that is

1041
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,439
like unlike a lot of like random cuts

1042
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,880
you get like where you kind of have to

1043
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,559
get the cut

1044
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,880
a lot of those dudes once they realize

1045
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,799
they couldn't get the real cut they just

1046
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,960
went and bought beans because you could

1047
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,079
still buy the line yeah and you but you

1048
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,440
know and it's like imagine if your

1049
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,480
buddies are selling it for a ton of

1050
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,838
money

1051
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,119
you might go to amsterdam and buy a

1052
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,358
hundred seeds

1053
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,760
yeah and come back and pop a bunch and

1054
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,400
then all of a sudden you've got the

1055
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,720
you know i've got i've got the piff

1056
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,320
yeah i've got the cube in black

1057
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,118
you know they called it

1058
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,039
my experience and this is this is uh

1059
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
i remember big herb i was trying to push

1060
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,559
a bunch of these off on him because i

1061
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,800
knew like no one wanted them but when i

1062
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,480
got the pif the dominicans asked me not

1063
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,560
to release it pure that was the only

1064
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,280
request they had don't release it pure

1065
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,119
and i wasn't gonna [ __ ] snub that you

1066
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,040
know like you didn't want to piss anyone

1067
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,880
off so i never did but i really regret

1068
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,800
it yeah i mean they have a there's a

1069
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
market so i don't claim to be an expert

1070
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
i mean there's there's different people

1071
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,879
we could probably bring on maybe in the

1072
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,200
future

1073
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,960
that know a lot more about the various

1074
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,118
names and origins of the various

1075
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,199
different haze things from new york i

1076
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,680
just wanted to bring it up in general

1077
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,919
that there's a bunch of cuts that get

1078
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,319
passed around in florida and new york

1079
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,800
more but but florida too

1080
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,000
and a bunch in holland and between those

1081
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,720
two areas that's like 15 different cuts

1082
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,960
yeah at least a bunch so

1083
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,838
it's probably the line that has the mo

1084
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,240
we're lucky if one or two phenos of any

1085
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,759
famous thing survives from the 90s to

1086
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,279
today yeah

1087
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,839
right

1088
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,480
can you think of any other line from

1089
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,639
that era that has as many cuts as nl5

1090
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,880
haze does that still float around

1091
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,679
not even close man we're still trying to

1092
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,960
find a single a lot of these lines you

1093
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,799
know

1094
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,320
yeah so

1095
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
you know and so you know some of this

1096
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,920
stuff people are talking about gold or

1097
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,920
brown haze or whatever um in my opinion

1098
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
uh and i've seen it in like chem 4 and

1099
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,599
i've seen it in various strains

1100
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,280
you know certain strains just when it

1101
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,079
when they're when they're around oxygen

1102
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,320
they sort of cure a little bit brown

1103
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,079
yeah i used to get remember like the the

1104
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,680
real cherry pie when it was growing

1105
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,800
would be like deep purple and would look

1106
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,639
all crazy

1107
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,119
when i did it depths and then i dry it

1108
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,879
and three weeks later it would the the

1109
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,838
the purple would turn a little light

1110
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
brown

1111
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,960
oh man i hated that about like

1112
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,519
blackberries too like that beautiful

1113
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,039
magenta red as it dries it turns just as

1114
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,800
nasty

1115
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,838
and some of those some of those haze

1116
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,160
crosses turn brown as they dry it's the

1117
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,400
colombian influence i believe and so it

1118
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,920
might be terpius all get out and fresh

1119
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,280
and smell delicious

1120
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,639
and someone looks at it and they're like

1121
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
this shit's old

1122
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:43,118
yeah you know old weed you know

1123
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,880
so it's just like it's a it's a uh

1124
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,240
you know i mean even like we i was we

1125
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,838
were talking about it i was talking

1126
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,239
about it earlier today but i have a

1127
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,920
buddy who made the chocolate top the uh

1128
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,879
the chocolate diesel

1129
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,880
yeah right and it's and that stuff it's

1130
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,760
basically a chocolate tie by dog by sour

1131
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,838
diesel

1132
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,920
yeah and it was phenomenal and we had it

1133
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,599
for a long time and no one wanted to

1134
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,159
ever buy it because it cured a light

1135
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,920
brown yeah because the chocolate part

1136
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,838
wasn't so much it smelled like chocolate

1137
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,559
it was that the tie was brown

1138
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,960
yeah and and and like karel said back in

1139
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,719
the day they wanted that brown yeah but

1140
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,400
that brown was it was good brown it was

1141
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,639
fresh it wasn't like it was [ __ ] up

1142
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,200
but it just a little yellow little brown

1143
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,838
little off colors yeah but what's crazy

1144
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,759
about haze is that that is like death on

1145
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,078
the west coast

1146
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,480
right brown any kind of brown color at

1147
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,839
all and it's like doom and i can see

1148
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,679
people in the comments or whatever

1149
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,559
talking about all the uptown brown's my

1150
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,159
favorite

1151
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,000
yeah that's the one

1152
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,358
i'd give me that brown

1153
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,440
yeah

1154
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,119
you know so

1155
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,079
uh there's a bunch of stuff like that

1156
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,640
where i can name them real quick um when

1157
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,280
we talk about a or c it's just basically

1158
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,118
like a holland shorthand for

1159
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,560

america of c5 it's that cut okay so the

1171
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,318
c5 cut in america is the one the c5 cut

1172
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,800
in america is the it's like the

1173
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,480
terpenoline bomb yes it's what made

1174
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
super silver haze so traprindling

1175
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,159
dominant yeah you know

1176
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,838
um and uh you know and so it it's um

1177
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,879
it's being passed around it made it over

1178
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,880
the oh and it's really amazing uplifting

1179
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,480
super potent weed

1180
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,760
it just you have to be able to handle

1181
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,039
terpenelene

1182
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,480
yeah if you don't like your pedaling

1183
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,199
it's going to be a real problem

1184
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,920
i smoked your pilling all day

1185
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:56,159
and uh and so there's like three c5s the

1186
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
final c5 was my favorite i used to smoke

1187
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,559
it over there in amsterdam

1188
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,760
it's the they call it the 122 or the

1189
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,719
mango

1190
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,240
and it's the mom of mango haze

1191
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,399
and it just taste it has more of that

1192
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,118
mercin like uh i don't forget i forget

1193
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,680
what the terp is that leads to mangoes

1194
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,280
but it smells like ripe mangoes

1195
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:20,719
and it's got a great high

1196
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,880
yeah c5 isn't ssh c5 is the mom of ssh

1197
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,719
someone just said so so then there's a

1198
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,838
there's three cuts of c5 at least over

1199
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,078
there there's two cuts of a5 they say

1200
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,239
there's a

1201
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,400
g13a there's a g13c

1202
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,000
there's a hash plant by c

1203
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,720
um

1204
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,239
i might be missing a couple i don't know

1205
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,199
but there's a bunch of them over there

1206
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,479
um

1207
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,879
and uh

1208
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,719
and then most of the ones in america

1209
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,440
are are you know nl5 across the sea

1210
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,799
yeah um even i should mention too that

1211
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,800
um neville gave soma of soma seeds some

1212
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,119
g13a

1213
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,240
and he took a mail of that and all of

1214
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,400
soma's

1215
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,959
sativa and hazy lines

1216
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,160
are based off that that mail

1217
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,760
that he kept

1218
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:11,519
from some g13a seeds that he got and so

1219
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,800
what it seems like and neville was

1220
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:17,358
pretty open about this on um

1221
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,560
on the uh on the forums over there

1222
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,440
was

1223
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,799
uh hayes does not like being cross to

1224
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,960
itself

1225
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,200
no yeah at all and what becomes hard is

1226
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,440
especially with the c

1227
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,838
the more you cross haze to itself

1228
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,519
uh neville called it cat piss we would

1229
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,599
probably uh we would probably call it um

1230
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,838
uh ter pedaling

1231
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,680
but but the more you cross it you get

1232
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,599
terpenoline dominant and then only

1233
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,159
rarely do others any kind of and that's

1234
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,200
what everybody thinks of is jack

1235
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:54,719
jack terps train wreck terps yep uh

1236
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,879
super case uh super silver haze terps uh

1237
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,598
that kind of stuff tends to dominate so

1238
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,358
yeah what it seems like is

1239
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,079
the best ones the ones that everybody

1240
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:07,119
keeps are the f1s yeah

1241
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,280
of haze to some indica

1242
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,000
and the poly hybrids like super silver

1243
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,480
haze mango haze uh jack herrera that

1244
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,920
kind of thing they don't seem to be as

1245
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,679
people don't seem to have keepers of

1246
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,119
those the same way not that there's not

1247
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,838
cuts of them that don't float around it

1248
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,880
might be nice

1249
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:24,719
yeah um

1250
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,119
but we should mention too because it's

1251
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,399
[ __ ] we're it's kind of like a ramble

1252
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,640
or whatever but

1253
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,559
most of these things are they're one of

1254
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,440
the most unique things about hayes is

1255
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,599
that

1256
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,679
most of the good ones take between 12

1257
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,880
and 16 weeks

1258
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,199
yeah

1259
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,039
long time long time

1260
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,358
a long time like i think the cuban

1261
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:49,119
blacks and a lot of the ones in new york

1262
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:51,199
90 to 100 days is a pretty common

1263
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,880
rate to take those ones

1264
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,879
the dog [ __ ] which is about the only

1265
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,640
west coast one that's any good

1266
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,920
um that one's

1267
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:02,480
12 13 weeks easy you know

1268
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,519
um all the stuff from europe uh

1269
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,960
you know was is all 15 16 weeks

1270
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,480
yeah

1271
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,639
you know and so that was one of the

1272
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,920
things that neville and shanti and all

1273
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,239
those guys that were [ __ ] around with

1274
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,639
it one of their criteria was they didn't

1275
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,598
want anything longer than 16 weeks

1276
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,519
yeah

1277
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,838
because it was impractical because

1278
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,480
asking someone to flower something for

1279
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,960
four months is already impractical yeah

1280
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,760
especially if it's a money-making thing

1281
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,440
yeah

1282
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,119
yeah you know so there's an aspect where

1283
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,039
it's like i uh

1284
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,880
you know they cut it off they wanted 14

1285
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,559
to 16 weeks

1286
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,480
you know and it seems like the earliest

1287
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,838
good ones are more like 12 and 13.

1288
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,800
yeah you know

1289
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,639
um but 14 to 16 seems to be the most

1290
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,359
common range that a lot of them fall

1291
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,039
into i was a big fan of the old sog

1292
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,598
super silver haze that was one of my

1293
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,519
favorites that ran pretty quick and was

1294
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,318
mostly skunk one dominant it's pretty

1295
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,719
cool sure yeah i mean those you know the

1296
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,838
super silver haze and the mango haze

1297
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:07,598
were both um two different nl5 haze moms

1298
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:10,239
crossed to the same skunk haze dad yeah

1299
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,160
right so the skunk helps like throw

1300
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,879
especially in the super silver it helped

1301
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,799
it throw bigger longer thicker colas

1302
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,119
yeah and it could shorten up the time a

1303
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,280
whole bunch

1304
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,358
in my opinion yeah you know

1305
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,240
um and uh

1306
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:28,880
so you know they so then it just became

1307
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,959
going back it just became [ __ ] famous

1308
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
yeah everybody had haze

1309
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,880
and all these seed companies wanted to

1310
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,480
obscure exactly how they got haze but

1311
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,559
hayes just became

1312
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,240
haze for a while was sort of shorthand

1313
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,279
for sativa

1314
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,879
yeah it was the sativa

1315
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,440
right yeah

1316
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,599
and you know and uh it got famous in

1317
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,119
america it got famous over there

1318
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,079
it was all these various different

1319
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,640
things

1320
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,640
um and it seems like you know like i

1321
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:59,679
said the f1s seem to be a lot better

1322
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,000
than the poly hybrids yeah now the poly

1323
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,919
hybrids weren't nice i've grown nice

1324
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,079
super silver haze i've had keepers of

1325
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,519
mango haze i loved

1326
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,680
um but

1327
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,960
it seems like all the most favorite ones

1328
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,239
are f1

1329
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,318
yeah

1330
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,959
so some type of afghani or [ __ ] cross

1331
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,039
the haze across the haze very two very

1332
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,880
different things slap together

1333
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,400
and then you see what they get yeah and

1334
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,000
even with those things crossed to it

1335
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,599
still the keepers were 14 16 weeks yeah

1336
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,239
so essentially like you're taking some

1337
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:34,079
colombian and like shortening it from

1338
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:36,719
20 to 24 to 14 to 16. i've seen uh

1339
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,440
columbia black go up to 26. that's

1340
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,199
[ __ ] insane yeah you know and so

1341
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,240
people are talking about pif piff is

1342
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,639
just

1343
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,598
you know pif is a catch-all term

1344
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,719
yeah or um it's one of the nicknames to

1345
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,480

00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,919
yeah you know people can argue i'm not

1347
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,559
going to sit there and say that i have

1348
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,880
some encyclopedic knowledge of how all

1349
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,640
the new york haze terms came about

1350
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,400
yeah um but it got a bunch it was

1351
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,279
popular enough for long enough that it

1352
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,440
has a bunch of nicknames

1353
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,440

um block work huh yes

1357
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:14,400
church

1358

short for frankincense

1360
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,719
you know uh all that all that different

1361
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,719
types of stuff said

1362
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:23,919
stands for pure i didn't know that's

1363
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,399
what it meant i don't know if that's

1364
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,639
colombian for pure dominican for pure

1365
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,800
they had a lot of nicknames yeah

1366
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,159
you know and probably just like kush and

1367
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,280
just like cookie just like everything

1368
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,879
else it got popular people got bag seeds

1369
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,640
people got lines

1370
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,240
from amsterdam still and popped their

1371
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,759
own thing and added their own name to it

1372
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:42,799
because they're trying to cash in on the

1373
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,520
thing

1374
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,599
so

1375
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,920
it's really hard to say but

1376
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:52,318
rarely you know that line was available

1377
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,680
for seven or eight years in seed form

1378
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:55,838
okay

1379
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,679
i have an idea

1380
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,119
i have an idea for a little game we can

1381
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,598
play

1382
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,519

pass or smoke

1385
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,839

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,079
idiot or you're going to smoke it

1387

00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,000
like it just wasn't it already died out

1404
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,599
by the time i got san diego

1405
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,440
um let's see here i'm trying to think of

1406
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,400
some some good hazy cuts that you've

1407
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,358

1408
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,358

1409
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,400

1411
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,800
there's nothing you're not gonna smoke

1412
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,559
that has haze in it now that i think

1413
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,440
about i don't think i could name one

1414
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,359
could you

1415
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,838
i could yeah i i would there's

1416
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:03,358
there's not really a jack i've seen

1417
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,838
that i wished i had a jar on my on my

1418
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,920
on my on my on my shelf there well so

1419
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,000
jack you're gonna pass on a jack that

1420
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,039
guy would pass on the jack or a pass on

1421
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,800
jack

1422
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:16,079
jack to me is like a huge yielding skunk

1423
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,839
one

1424
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,480
on a haze frame

1425
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:22,558
yeah you know and it's like just i

1426
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,199
i don't know it like the type of

1427
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,480
terpenoline that jack is is not my

1428
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,799
favorite

1429
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,679
it's more like it doesn't taste good to

1430
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,760
me

1431
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,358
you know i know people love it you know

1432
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,720
and people loved it because they got two

1433
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,039
three pounds of light with it and they

1434
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,558
crushed it in depths and greenhouses and

1435
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,679
they basically grew the [ __ ] out of it

1436
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:44,720
until the buyers were like uh

1437
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,159
you know yeah yeah

1438
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,399
how about you

1439
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,558
have you tried amnesia yet amnesia some

1440
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,318
watered down [ __ ] i thought it was it's

1441
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,200
one of my favorites really all the

1442
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:55,279
reasons

1443
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,439
is one of my favorites by far because

1444
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,359
it's so like perfumey fruity like it's

1445
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,358
just nice man

1446
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,920
yeah i don't know i mean i like i like

1447
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,279
the i like the church the frankincense

1448
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,920
the mercene

1449
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,680
yeah um i can't i'm not a terpenoline

1450
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,039
hater by any means like i said i mean

1451
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:14,719
like i said c5 is a terpenoline bomb

1452
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,239
yeah but there's a difference to me

1453
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,039
between terpenoline that has a little

1454
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,598
bit of sweetness or creaminess behind it

1455
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,480
and like i just sprayed my mouth with

1456
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,119
like floor hanger yeah that's true and

1457
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,039
that that terpenoline you know it's like

1458
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,640
and i think for jack and stuff like that

1459
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:31,838
there was just a bunch of badly grown

1460
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,239
jack

1461
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:37,119
and it overwhelmed just like train wreck

1462
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,598
you know it overwhelms people yeah

1463
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,119
you know like that durbin um that durbin

1464
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,720
from colorado or whatever that one's a

1465
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,599
terpenoline bomb too sure is you know

1466
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,159
it is

1467
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,920
super terpene and you know it's like i

1468
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,399
like there's all kinds of wheat i smoke

1469
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,280
i'm not a hater on it yeah um but when i

1470
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,800
when i the interesting part to me is

1471
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,319
it's not so much

1472
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,318
the only thing i can think of that's

1473
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,920
like really strong terpenelene that i

1474
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,838
love the high

1475
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,200
is the c5

1476
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,920
interesting

1477
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,919
i don't know about that does it for you

1478
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,599
you know i don't know why that is but

1479
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,519
yeah um

1480
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,119
you know but they uh

1481
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:16,960
you know what's cool about it is that

1482
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,039
because it made money in coffee shops

1483
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,760
for so long and still does

1484
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,599
um it's still hoarded over there yeah

1485
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,079
and people accuse us reporting that [ __ ]

1486
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,838
is legit hoarded dude people are like so

1487
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,119
many people put stipulations on those

1488
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:30,558
[ __ ] cuts

1489
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,400
i mean like

1490
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,119
there are certain seed lines like me and

1491
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,800
caleb can never release

1492
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,480
no because they'll be they'll be super

1493
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,519
pissed off and people will be angry and

1494
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,440
it's like

1495
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,880
and you know it's been monetized over

1496
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,639
there for so long and been sold in

1497
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,318
coffee shops and if you got the cuts you

1498
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:47,838
had to give kickbacks to the dudes that

1499
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,599
i was like very

1500
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:50,880
so those things it's like and they don't

1501
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,720
give a [ __ ] they don't want to trade you

1502
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,318
for [ __ ] they have what they have and

1503
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,799
they don't it's so that's like the

1504
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,000
ultimate hoarding because honestly

1505
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,720
um

1506
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,599
they didn't slip out until neville died

1507
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,159
yeah

1508
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,920
yeah the entire time that he was alive

1509
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:08,000
that [ __ ] was on lockdown with those

1510
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,639
guys yep

1511
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,358
right yep and then

1512
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,960
two only two of those cuts maybe more

1513
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,318
but only you know but

1514
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,119
yeah

1515
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:22,159
i love that

1516
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,400
one of the sources for those cuts

1517
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,078
i was sent a list with those on me i was

1518
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,680
like i want those two

1519
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,200
and the dude didn't even know what the

1520
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,480
[ __ ] they were until i told them what

1521
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,480
they were and that was the biggest

1522
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,318
mistake i ever made

1523
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,000
i don't i don't like to dick people and

1524
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,838
be like you know i wanted i like to

1525
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,358
trade equal value so even if they find

1526
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,838
out later it's rare they at least got

1527
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,598
their worth but

1528
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:45,759
yeah i mean the hard part is the hard

1529
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,519
part is that um

1530
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,920
you know these things would never be

1531
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,920
popular okay yes no you really have to

1532
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,280
you really have to like the high um

1533
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,720
because yeah

1534
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
you should know what you're growing too

1535
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,799
because i see a lot of people asking

1536
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,079
about the a5s ones and stuff like

1537
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,960
that that's not going to be a super like

1538
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,039
marketable commercial crop nowadays that

1539
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,960
would sell really well i think people

1540
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,719
have this like fantasized idea because

1541
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,240
you're saying it's dank and they they

1542
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,159
respect your word they don't understand

1543
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,399
what it would what what this definition

1544
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,920
of dank would look like

1545
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,160
dank and ugly

1546
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,680
it is [ __ ] like i mentioned before

1547
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,440
like people were talking on the thing

1548
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:26,000
about how much they love the uptown

1549
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,599
brown yeah you couldn't sell uptown

1550
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,239
brown in california

1551
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,680
no [ __ ] way no way don't get me wrong

1552
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,838
even if i agree with you and i say that

1553
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,000
weed's amazing it still wouldn't sell

1554
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,920
here yeah it just couldn't and like if

1555
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,400
you see the pictures of a5 there's no

1556
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,318
resin production anywhere on any leaf

1557
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,480
no for miles and you just look at it be

1558
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,358
like [ __ ] that dude sucks it growing but

1559
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,240
really

1560
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,519
it's the plant it's ugly yeah but it

1561
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,358
works

1562
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,280
you know and so you really have to be

1563
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,558
into the high so it's like they're every

1564
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,559
like all these dutch you're like trying

1565
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,720
to hoard it like americans are gonna

1566
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,720
like [ __ ] with their money yeah yeah

1567
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,318
when you really have to be a consumer

1568
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,639
like a lover of cannabis because it

1569
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,318
takes four months so you have to plan

1570
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,480
that it's going to take twice as long as

1571
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,558
the rest of your [ __ ] yeah and you got

1572
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,798
to keep it happy and healthy and bug

1573
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,640
free and pee and all the various issues

1574
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:18,239
free that long and it don't wash

1575
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:22,558
yeah and then you know and then you get

1576
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:24,879
some great weed yeah you know and so um

1577
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,798
so it's not you know but in in holland

1578
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,640
it's like all my first experiences with

1579
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,519
smoking all those ones were all haul and

1580
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,480
grown

1581
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,079
yeah

1582
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,639
and maybe i could tell a story that

1583
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,960
people uh people might like so

1584
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:40,078
i went and saw this room in holland that

1585
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,480
was growing neville's haze and uh c5 and

1586
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,480
then 122 right

1587
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,679
and so i go into this room and it was

1588
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,519
one of

1589
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,279
i only met neville a couple of times but

1590
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,719
it was one of his partners okay and so i

1591
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,760
go into this room

1592
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,078
and

1593
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,440
it's like there's like one gallon pots

1594
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,318
on the ground

1595
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,760
okay

1596
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:02,318
um with those grodan like

1597
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,079
rockwool croutons yeah you know like the

1598
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,318
yellow and the croutons yeah

1599
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,640
little crouton little squares right yes

1600
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,880
one gallon pots with these stems coming

1601
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,118
out of them that were like that big

1602
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,240
and those stems went six seven feet up

1603
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,440
in the air

1604
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,279
yeah okay bare right and so imagine this

1605
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,000
little one gallon pot with this stem

1606
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,000
that's like half as wide as the pot yeah

1607
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,159
going six feet straight up and then

1608
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,838
branches everywhere and like two or

1609
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:29,519
three layers of

1610
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,358
uh of netting

1611
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,199
yeah and then they just had a bunch of

1612
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:34,798
600s on the ceiling

1613
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:36,318
i i forgot to tell you i had a

1614
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,000
conversation with seattle greg the other

1615
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:39,599
day and he said when he went into

1616
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,159
neville's grow room

1617
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:45,119
instead he said when he first got there

1618
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,798
neville was growing rockwool slabs on

1619
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,480
the ground on the ground yeah and they

1620
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:49,838
had they had drains in there or whatever

1621
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,280
else and they would be honest like the

1622
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,960
slowest constant drip ever you know

1623
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,359
um but it was like you're looking at

1624
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,599
literally these they were probably 10 12

1625
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,119
20 10 12 foot paul plants that was like

1626
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,838
where the weed was

1627
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,079
and it started at above i'm 6'3 it

1628
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,318
started above my head that's like i

1629
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,839
walked in and all the netting was above

1630
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,440
my head and there's these tiny ass

1631
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:15,759
little pots on slow drip and just like a

1632
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,519
sea of spears

1633
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,880
how big was the ceiling how tall were

1634
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,559
the ceilings they were pretty tall they

1635
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,000
were like 14 feet or something like that

1636
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,920
yeah they had to be i mean if the

1637
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,079
[ __ ] canopy starts at the top of your

1638
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,519
head that's a canopy started the canopy

1639
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,440
started about seven feet it was about

1640
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,119
half a foot above my head

1641
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,720
and from seven to ten feet was where

1642
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,720
most of the weed was and then the lights

1643
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,159
were hanging off the ceiling and it was

1644
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,399
like six feet like you looked and there

1645
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,639
was like a sea of

1646
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,079
brant of of stock

1647
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:43,519
coming out of the thing and going up

1648
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,318
above your head and then branching out

1649
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,759
into huge branches all over that's wild

1650
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,358
it was pretty well i've never seen at

1651
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,760
the time i'd never seen anything like

1652
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,519
that before in my life because people

1653
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,040
people are confusing they're saying they

1654
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,679
thought you were five foot ten no that's

1655
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,920
me i'm five foot ten

1656
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,480
yeah i'm six three so

1657
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,318
it was above my head and um you know

1658
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,039
what's crazy about that is that their

1659
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:09,199
drip system fails for instance that

1660
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,119
shit's dead in like two hours

1661
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,358
yeah that that's what's always scared me

1662
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,318
about like drip systems feeds hydroponic

1663
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:18,000
systems i mean it was literally on like

1664
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,719
the slowest drip you could imagine it

1665
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,719
was basically constant yeah

1666
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,480
you know it's constant feet during the

1667
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:25,519
light cycle you know

1668
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
so

1669
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,639
um

1670
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,400
yeah it was it was pretty but that's how

1671
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:33,358
they grew and that was neville's haze

1672
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,680
and the mango haze and the c5 yeah and

1673
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,639
those were all grown for coffee shops at

1674
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,318
the time

1675
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,078
yeah you know

1676
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:41,920
um and they were dank i mean the

1677
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,599
neville's haze um

1678
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,599
is is a5 by hay c

1679
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,359
you know and the cut that i love still

1680
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,960
exists i hope that it gets sent over to

1681
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:52,719
america sometime

1682
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,760
um i would go what the [ __ ] are you

1683
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:55,919
laughing at

1684
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,119
everybody's doubting my height

1685
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,240
no he's short

1686
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,240
like ten

1687
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:04,239
huh liars

1688
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,239
he's uh he's short i don't know

1689
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,039
he's he's short you know

1690
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,280
so five ten is a little short you're

1691
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:14,719
right

1692
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,240
he might uh i don't know

1693
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,239
girl pinocchio knows

1694
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,639
there is uh there was some really good

1695
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,760
neville's hazes there's there's rumor

1696
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,279
uh

1697
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,119
it's really hard to substantiate

1698
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,640
anything with shanti or any of the euro

1699
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,798
guys in general

1700
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,199
um so we don't know if neville's haze is

1701
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:35,679
the same or not yeah

1702
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:38,719
you know um we don't uh someone asked if

1703
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:40,000
we could break down karma's a5 s1 yeah

1704
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,318
he should change his name to snitch

1705
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,440
hayes s1

1706
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,920
yeah i mean

1707
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,559
you know he he reversed the i i don't

1708
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,000
think the i don't think the um

1709
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,400
i don't think the haze is like being

1710
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,358
bred even to even to

1711
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,960
um out crosses of themselves yeah they

1712
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,679
certainly don't that doesn't seem like

1713
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,119
they like to be s1 very much no

1714
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,358
there's a lot of ugly and then

1715
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,880
[ __ ] i mean yeah there's a lot

1716
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,880
of ugly you might get and that's part of

1717
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,079
the problem too is like when it comes to

1718
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,838
haze

1719
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,599
you know

1720
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,119
your the best stuff is gonna be three to

1721
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,880
four months

1722
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,039
a bunch of it's going to be junk a bunch

1723
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,960
of it's going to be jungle weed yeah

1724
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:22,400
you're not going to know for forever it

1725
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:25,039
takes a long time to freaking uh

1726
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,039
you know to get it going so it's like i

1727
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:30,000
mean i could tell a story that i i've

1728
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,239
told privately or whatever but uh i went

1729
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,318
out i went out to the cannabis cup and i

1730
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,239
think it was 98 or something like that

1731
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:39,119
and uh it was the first year that they

1732
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,439
released uh neville's hayes seats

1733
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,519
yeah okay and neville's haze was so

1734
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,480
everybody knows it was supposed to be a

1735
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:48,480
private breeding um of

1736
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,199
of neville's and he was trying to make

1737
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,119
what he called the holy grail yeah a

1738
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,798
haze line so he took

1739
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:58,318
um he took

1740
01:00:54,798 --> 01:01:00,719
his favorite a5 um which which was on

1741
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:02,639
the cover of the 89 and 90 catalog that

1742
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,798
female and he threw that on the haze

1743
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,199
email yeah and it was the first time he

1744
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,798
tried to breed both haze dads into a

1745
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,439
single thing

1746
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:13,199
and they found this cut over there that

1747
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,679
was the strongest sativa i've ever

1748
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:17,439
smoked in my life

1749
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,798
i've talked about it before it's i

1750
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,960
remember it

1751
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,599
that neville's hates oh it just never

1752
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,920
tastes female you know yeah yeah it it

1753
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,519
make i mean it it is unbelievably potent

1754
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,318
in a way that weed is not normally

1755
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,318
potent yeah um and so

1756
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:34,480
i smoked it over there and it blew my

1757
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:36,239
head off like it it made it hard for me

1758
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,039
to walk downstairs

1759
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,118
yeah

1760
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,279
i like held onto the railing and i felt

1761
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,880
disassociated and i felt

1762
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,880
like it hit me in a weird it made me

1763
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,880
feel like i was smoking kind bud with no

1764
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,960
tolerance yeah

1765
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,880
like i got it was intense

1766
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,798
and i got high for hours and so i just

1767
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,200
brought some of these seeds home and i'd

1768
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,400
never grown an extreme sativa before

1769
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,239
so

1770
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,920
i was going to breed with this [ __ ]

1771
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,199
and i grew it for a few months i took

1772
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,680
some cuttings

1773
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,000
and then once they rooted and i knew i

1774
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,038
had backup copies i flipped it to see

1775
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,358
what was up

1776
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,480
yeah well i flipped it at 12 12. you

1777
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,480
know this is like 1999 or something yeah

1778
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,798
i made that mistake before too yeah and

1779
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,480
it it vegged for months with no pistols

1780
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:20,960
yeah just you wait when you're like week

1781
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,400
seven you're like yeah and i was like

1782
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,240
what the [ __ ] like all my shit's

1783
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,480
finishing up and it's barely starting

1784
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,358
and i was like oh yeah so

1785
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,318
i like i i tossed them and then i took

1786
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,598
clones and i flowered those

1787
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:34,880
and then i put more [ __ ] in there

1788
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,440
because i was trying to breed with it

1789
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,760
and then the same [ __ ] thing happened

1790
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,838
right and i didn't know at the time

1791
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,440
that a lot of those guys over there will

1792
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,358
tell you that if you really want to get

1793
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,000
your sativas to do well

1794
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,920
yeah clone them a few times and let the

1795
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,159
plant itself get to be six or seven

1796
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,318
months old yeah because that's its

1797
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:57,038
natural veg cycle before it would even

1798
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,719
start to bloom in the tropics yeah you

1799
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,319
got to realize it's going to veg for a

1800
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,159
long ass time

1801
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,719
and he's like no if you're getting an a5

1802
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:07,358
cut that was popped in 89 you can just

1803
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:10,879
flip it yeah obviously yeah and then i

1804
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:13,598
didn't know anything about 11 14 or 10

1805
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,358
11 13 or 10 14 or anything like that

1806
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,480
which is basically just like for people

1807
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,318
that don't grow

1808
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,480
it's uh how much hours of light and how

1809
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:24,318
much hours of darkness yeah so 12 12 for

1810
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,559
uh you know 22 years ago or whatever

1811
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:29,838
that was fine for all my indicas

1812
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,440
for neville's that was like veg

1813
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:33,358
in order to get it to start i had to

1814
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,760
give it 11 hours of light and 13 hours

1815
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:38,960
of darkness it had to be over six months

1816
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,960
old and then i had to finish it at 10 14

1817
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,000
for like the final six weeks

1818
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,119
yeah

1819
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,440
yeah and so i [ __ ] up a bunch

1820
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,119
yeah i did that with the malawi too

1821
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,720
buddy's the one who taught me that trick

1822
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,318
because i would have never i wouldn't

1823
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,798
even made

1824
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,719
sense of it back then no i hadn't i had

1825
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,880
no idea i didn't i didn't even make

1826
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:00,318
sense of it until i had a buddy in

1827
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,160
amsterdam who

1828
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:03,199
grew for neville and i went back to

1829
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,679
europe

1830
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:08,480
and saw him the next year and told him

1831
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,318
like basically my follies yeah and he

1832
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,519
just laughed at me and he laid all that

1833
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,318
[ __ ] out

1834
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,159
yeah and i had money i had no idea dude

1835
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:19,038
i mean it makes sense when someone says

1836
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:21,920
it like and then you're like oh

1837
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,839
god that makes sense and how easy yeah

1838
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,838
every other strain i'd ever grown of

1839
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,838
cannabis at that point in time when i

1840
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:29,920
turned the lights back to 12 12

1841
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,078
everything i needed to happen happened

1842
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,960
yeah that was my first experience with

1843
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,280
like weed that didn't do that

1844
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,880
you know and and so that's only with

1845
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,798
extreme sativas if it's got enough

1846
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,480
indica and it should trigger

1847
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,559
[ __ ] it's only and it's only if it's

1848
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,880
from seed

1849
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,400
because seeds know they're young

1850
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,160
someone was asking if any of us had

1851
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,720
grown kelly missed here's an old

1852
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,118
original pack low numbered pack

1853
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,199
early on of cali mist that we haven't

1854
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:00,480
popped yet

1855
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,879
one day huh natto yeah one day

1856
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,519
um you know so i mean it should be said

1857
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,440
about the cali mist uh simon worked for

1858
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,079
neville

1859
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,559
its origins are unknown

1860
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,240
neville thinks that it's an nl5 haze a

1861
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,280
female

1862
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,479
um

1863
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,079
it uh

1864
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,519
but he think he you know he thought that

1865
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,599
everything in europe was based off his

1866
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,798
work so that's not surprise he thought

1867
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,880
everything in america was based off his

1868
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:27,519
work but what is interesting is that

1869
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,318
having talked to some dutch people

1870
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,358
um

1871
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,159
they say that um that the

1872
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,480
uh

1873
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,960
the the cali mist was based off a mother

1874
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,920
plant called the mango

1875
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,838
yeah

1876
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,000
now whether it's the same whether it's

1877
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,400
the same mango that that founded the

1878
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,318
mango haze and the 122

1879
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,160
or whether it's a different thing

1880
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,759
i can't say but they said for a long

1881
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:51,759
time it was alive in europe and then it

1882
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,440
got and then it got lost

1883
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,319
yeah

1884
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,440
so

1885
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,920
um

1886
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,519
people talking about kelly missed

1887
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,760
western winds i remember western winds

1888
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,000
has some cambo in it or supposedly it's

1889
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,240
the same [ __ ] thing yeah and it has

1890
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,119
camo in it so people did

1891
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,479
so people that uh people that um

1892
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,039
that don't know

1893
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,639
uh tony from sac martha and simon from

1894
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,000
sirius had a company that we talked

1895
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:18,798
about before cerebral seeds for one year

1896
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,199
right

1897
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:24,159
and they split up tony made sag martha

1898
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,439
seeds simon made serious seeds

1899
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,519
and

1900
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,280
simon's version of the cali mist was

1901
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,199
called cali mist

1902
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,280
tony's version of the same line was

1903
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:34,960
called western winds

1904
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,119
which is i think one of the cooler names

1905
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,480
in cannabis i always liked the name

1906
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,720
western winds

1907
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,719
i thought that was a super neat name

1908
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:44,159
just makes me think of gas

1909
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,318
you know so

1910
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:48,000
so yeah so i've heard people in europe

1911
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:50,159
tell me that they preferred tony's

1912
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,920
version to simon's

1913
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:52,798
that the western wins

1914
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,720
um

1915
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,480
but you know then

1916
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,318
it's hard to say uh those guys don't

1917
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,480
really reveal parentage

1918
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:01,838
no uh we don't know what's in the cali

1919
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,599
mist we don't know what's in the bubble

1920
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:07,759
gum we don't know it's in the uh ak-47

1921
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,880
um it's it's hard to say

1922
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:14,079
um but but the 90s cali missed

1923
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,599
simon got busted in 99 or 2000 when they

1924
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,839
changed the laws

1925
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,240
and it seems like several of his lines

1926
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:21,599
changed after that yeah and the cali

1927
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,358
mist was one of them

1928
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,440
but in the 90s there was some really

1929
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:28,480
amazing cali miss cuts

1930
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,720
yeah it was it was a nice line

1931
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,400
um you know so

1932
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,558
um you know yeah it's it's that's kind

1933
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,318
of what happened it's like people

1934
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,920
you know people were getting you could

1935
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:41,519
buy um

1936
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:44,639
they called it uh pure haze f10

1937
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:47,358
remember from uh from uh flying dutchman

1938
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:49,358
yep and they'd straight up tell you 80

1939
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,159
of it is junk

1940
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:55,519
10 of it is is is pretty good

1941
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:57,199
and 10 of it is special i don't know if

1942
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,719
if flying dutchman said that i know tom

1943
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:02,159
hill said that

1944
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:04,000
i'm pretty sure that in the description

1945
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,960
they talked about how inbred it was

1946
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,798
already

1947
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,559
okay and that its best use was for

1948
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:11,358
hybrids and outcrossing

1949
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,760
but if you were trying to find a winner

1950
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,880
be prepared that only less than ten

1951
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,719
percent

1952
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,400
yeah so you'd have to do like at least a

1953
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,359
hundred one hunt

1954
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,278
yep

1955
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,600
and so doing a hundred hundred plant

1956
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,120
haze hunt is a [ __ ] nightmare those

1957
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,440
are expensive

1958
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:30,158
yes expensive and nightmarish because

1959
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:32,238
it's gonna be a bunch of jungle weed

1960
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:34,000
and the shittiest looking weed

1961
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:36,158
could end up being fire

1962
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,600
yeah you're not gonna know until you dry

1963
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,079
it and smoke it you're not going to know

1964
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
how potent it is it can be like look

1965
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,640
resin-less

1966
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,318
yeah and still take your head off

1967
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,159
right yep

1968
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,759
i mean so

1969
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,639
but what's cool about it

1970
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:55,279
is that it was so fire that it's become

1971
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,039
one of the most common names in cannabis

1972
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,560
and it's been blended into all kinds of

1973
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,679
[ __ ] for forever

1974
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,000
yeah

1975
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:05,119
you know blue dream has haze in it

1976
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,759
you know lots of lots of huge yielding

1977
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:09,439
plants have haze in their background

1978
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,238
because of that stretch

1979
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,399
yeah the stretch the yield

1980
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,238
the high if you could throw if you could

1981
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,399
like jack herrera was basically figuring

1982
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:20,559
out a way to get skunk buds on a haze

1983
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:24,318
frame yeah and if you could get a

1984
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:28,880
ginormous haze plant with huge skunk

1985
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:30,798
running colas and a little nl density

1986
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,798
then you're three pounds of light bro

1987
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,198
yeah

1988
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:37,519
yeah three pounds of light three pounds

1989
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,838
of light bro i just didn't know the days

1990
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,839
you're supposed to [ __ ]

1991
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,000
lollipop on for three pounds of life but

1992
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,600
i don't remember it anymore

1993
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,960
so maybe i don't know maybe we should

1994
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,560
we've been we've been

1995
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,359
rambling about haze for a minute maybe

1996
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,640
we should talk a little about so neville

1997
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:57,679
made neville made all these um

1998
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,000
all these hybrids only a few of which he

1999
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,880
ended up selling to the public

2000
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,079
yeah but there was a bunch um like the

2001
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:09,119
g13 haze crosses and uh

2002
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:11,840
the the silver haze which was afghan a

2003
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,359
maple leaf afghan tea by haze and

2004
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,480
different things he passed out to

2005
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,880
friends

2006
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:18,479
and peep other people in amsterdam and

2007
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,760
even some people that bought seeds off

2008
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:22,000
him early on

2009
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,440
yeah so those things got spread out a

2010
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,640
little bit and there was keepers that

2011
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:27,039
were found

2012
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,560
even though you could never buy g13 by

2013
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,519
jese

2014
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,239
yeah

2015
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,520
you know they had it

2016
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:37,198
and then you know um after that

2017
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,960
uh he started trying to make poly

2018
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,759
hybrids and blend them all together and

2019
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,158
cross various select cuts he'd found

2020
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,039
he tried to cross he was trying to do

2021
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,920
skunk hate skunk nl and haze mixed

2022
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,519
together

2023
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,239
yeah because he considered those to be

2024
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,800
like the three most famous lines in in

2025

2056
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,880
ben and alan drunkers because they were

2057

scentsy and scent and neville was at

2058
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,279

2064
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,359
pheno of it

2065
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,960
um that they had at the cup that they

2066

had flour at the cup

2067
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,719
and then they they released jack herrera

2068
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:29,599
as a seedline at scentsy seeds that uh

2069
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,359

2077
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,800
[ __ ] uh brothers grimm c99

2078

2081
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,519
or whatever it is so

2082
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,439
yeah it's a backseat so it could be half

2083
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,640
jack or full jack

2084
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:06,319
as you know

2085
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,239
supposedly if you believe him it was

2086
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:09,519
found in a bud of jack herrera bought at

2087
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:11,198
a coffee shop

2088
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,560
yeah and he brought it home and did [ __ ]

2089
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,039
with it so

2090
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,360
um neville wasn't satisfied

2091
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:19,760
with the with jack herrera he felt it

2092
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:23,599
was still unfinished and he left

2093
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:25,679
um he left uh scentsy later that year

2094
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,719
and he kept working on

2095
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,079
the project and he got uh shanti baba to

2096
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,920
help him

2097
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:33,198
and they basically they had the mothers

2098
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,920
that they wanted they were going to use

2099
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:37,759
the c5 and the 122.

2100
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,679
and they kept trying to find different

2101
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,880
skunk haze dads that would do what they

2102
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,480
wanted

2103
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,079
yeah and according to them

2104
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:45,279
it took a long time and a bunch of

2105
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:46,800
different males and a bunch of different

2106
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:47,599
growing [ __ ] out a bunch of pain in the

2107
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,079
ass

2108
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,920
but uh after a few years they found a

2109
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,119
skunk haze dad

2110
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,760
that worked

2111
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:59,039
and neville preferred that skunk haze

2112
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:01,600
crossed to the uh c5

2113
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,000
and shanti preferred that same dad

2114
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,760
crossed to the 122

2115
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,039
and they couldn't agree on which one was

2116
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,480
the better line and better

2117
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,719
representative

2118
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,639
so they released both

2119
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:16,560
and they called the

2120
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:19,920
skunk haze by c5 the super silver haze

2121
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:22,800
and they called the uh mango haze by

2122
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,480
same skunk dad mango haze

2123
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,480
you know super super haze is one that

2124
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,319
i've actually ran a bunch of and that's

2125
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,559
one that i had the hardest time finding

2126
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,799
keepers in but i have smoked others

2127
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,640
keepers like i said the old socks always

2128
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,320
one of my favorite but there are some

2129
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,840
really good keepers out there but i just

2130
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:40,639
never had luck with super soaps i

2131
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,039
brought i brought some to um

2132
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,199
i think our party a couple of times

2133
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:47,600
it wasn't mine wasn't super elite i

2134
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,439
wouldn't say it was a nice cut um it

2135
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,520
yielded like crazy it was great to death

2136
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,919
and great to grow outside yeah and it

2137
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,560
had a lot of qualities you want in mold

2138
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,119
resistance and just general happiness

2139
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,800
um you know it had a light terpene base

2140
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,679
or whatever but

2141
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,239
um

2142
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,800
but so basically super silver haze and

2143
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:11,678
neville and uh mango haze are two

2144
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:14,719
sisters crossed to the same dad

2145
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:17,119
you know so they're pretty close

2146
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,359
uh but they're just different you know

2147
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:21,920
um super silver haze tends to be more

2148
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:23,679
terpenoline mango haze tends to be a bit

2149
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,800
more mercine

2150
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:30,480
more bit more mango style i tend to i

2151
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,320
like the mango haze better as a haze

2152
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,919
the super silver haze is a crazy

2153
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,399
production plant

2154
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,440
yeah um and then i've had some euros

2155
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,399
tell me

2156
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,319
um

2157
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,319
like uh gene finder

2158
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,238
that there was a super silver haze in

2159
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:46,479
europe that was like a 14 weaker that

2160
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,559
was like their all-time favorite

2161
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:49,919
interesting that one seems lost

2162
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,120
oh that sucks

2163
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,359
it does

2164
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,640
uh but there was an outlier that was a

2165
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,279
more hazy

2166
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,320
more you know more more you know less

2167
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:00,559
skunk

2168
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,759
more haze and that was supposedly

2169
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,760
phenomenal

2170
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,480
um but in a poly hybrid it's going to be

2171
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,360
hard to to find something

2172
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,599
you know

2173
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,679
um neville complained

2174
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,679
that none of his poly hybrid work was as

2175
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,800
nice as any of the f1s

2176
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,480
yeah

2177
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,960
no matter how hard he tried they just

2178
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:22,000
weren't quite as good

2179
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,840
you know um but i will say

2180
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,520
that that neville's haze that he made

2181
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,880
it's the most potent sativa i've ever

2182
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,719
tried in my life

2183
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,679
and i know that cut still exists in

2184
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,719
europe

2185
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,640
yeah

2186
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,719
so it's really amazing you know what's

2187
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,480
interesting i just thought about it

2188
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,079
i don't think most breeders or seed

2189
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,479
makers even talk about the failures

2190
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:40,479
anymore

2191
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,800
no

2192
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,520
well that's because um most of instagram

2193
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,440
and social media is marketing

2194
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,120
yeah yeah i guess it doesn't pay to talk

2195
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,319
about your failures like do you know

2196
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,039
what you know i mean you know what the

2197
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:57,679
greatest cure for powdery mildew was

2198
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,840
what instagram oh oh you know you're

2199
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,199
right yeah it just disappeared never see

2200
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,520
it gone

2201
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,559
so weird yeah no one ever struggles with

2202
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,159
it

2203
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,560
right and then you know why because it

2204
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:10,000
gets curated out yep

2205
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,239
you're like oh this is a beautiful bud

2206
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,079
and there's like one spot of you know of

2207
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,599
mildew on a family for your whatever and

2208
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:17,198
you're just like [ __ ]

2209
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,039
i remember you know

2210
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:20,000
this is a little off topic but i do

2211
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,319
remember

2212
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,840
when swerves cali connection story came

2213
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:25,519
out in high times and he was so proud

2214
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,600
and you [ __ ] took pictures of it

2215
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,719
threw it online and the first thing

2216
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,679
everyone sees is big old powdery mildew

2217
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,600
[ __ ] spots all over his leaves

2218
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,520
yeah we used to get grilled if you'd

2219
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,239
show up with powdery mildew on anything

2220
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,960
so i think the uh internet culture kind

2221
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,959
of

2222
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,119
negated that because people would get

2223
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,279
[ __ ] railed on see you want to know

2224
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,158
how i'm i'm not big on conspiracy

2225
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:50,238
theories

2226
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:51,920
yeah you know but i'll tell a story that

2227
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:53,439
most people don't know

2228
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,000
uh is that

2229
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:58,960
the thing that sent powdery mildew into

2230
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,760
northern california mendo and humble and

2231
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,399
made it forever an issue yeah it was

2232
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,520
osama bin laden and 9 11.

2233
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:07,759
why is that

2234
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,960
it's [ __ ] crazy so

2235
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:13,520
9 11 happens right it's september 11th

2236
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,079
and he crashes he crashes these

2237
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,760
airliners into the twin towers right

2238
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:21,039
yeah so everybody's all freaked out and

2239
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,760
they shut down airliners for three days

2240
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:26,158
yeah okay but they were worried about

2241
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,239
them al qaeda planning biological

2242
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,639
attacks on cities

2243
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:32,799
so they grounded all america's spray

2244
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,840
planes so they couldn't spray biological

2245
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,480
agents for eight weeks

2246
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,319
okay so from septem so from september

2247
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:42,718
11th all the way through september all

2248
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,920
the way through october no spray paints

2249
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,119
could be

2250
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,039
in marin in sonoma in napa in mendo you

2251
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:50,479
couldn't have spray plants okay and

2252
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:52,719
that's how a bunch of those places

2253
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:55,519
control powdery mildew

2254
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:58,079
wow okay so then in the santa rosa paper

2255
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,239
which is the big town in sonoma

2256
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:02,479
afterwards you see things like robert

2257
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:04,399
mondavi and other people losing millions

2258
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,198
of dollars in grapes this year to

2259
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:09,679
powdery mildew jesus and all those

2260
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:12,319
vineyards are all right by the highway

2261
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:15,520
yeah and i [ __ ] you not dude

2262
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:17,599
in the 90s and in 2000 2001 all the

2263
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,120
hydro stores i would go into

2264
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,880
none of them had any powdery mildew

2265
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:22,719
control

2266
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,239
none of my friends had powdery mildew

2267
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,679
powdery mildew was something that you

2268
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,718
got like

2269
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:31,039
outdoor maybe in october maybe a touch

2270
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:33,520
here and there if you got unlucky

2271
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:36,719
never saw it never saw it indoor never

2272
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,760
ever ever not not a single clone ever

2273
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:41,679
and within two months of 9 11 happening

2274
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,400
every single one of my friends had it

2275
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:47,039
yeah and then within a year or two every

2276
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:50,879
hydro store had a whole shelf

2277
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:52,000
oh no here's how to kill the [ __ ]

2278
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,560
you know there was stuff there was

2279
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,600
biologicals like aq10

2280
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,440
um you know there was there was uh you

2281
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,880
know you know there was it was learning

2282
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:03,759
about how to kill that [ __ ] and how to

2283
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,840
get rid of it was uncomfortable yeah it

2284
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,360
was really bunk because it looked like

2285
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,880
in the beginning it wasn't [ __ ] up

2286
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,960
your weed

2287
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,279
yeah but it really [ __ ] up your weed

2288
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,800
oh it really [ __ ] it up you know it's

2289
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:16,158
like you think spider mites are [ __ ]

2290
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,320
up your weed they're not really [ __ ]

2291
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,920
up your weed

2292
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:21,840
that's really really messing with your

2293
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,039
herb and so it took a number of years to

2294
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,960
figure out how to not transfer it how to

2295
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,079
you know no one had ever dealt with it

2296
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,920
yeah

2297
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:31,840
i'd never seen it like the first two

2298
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,239
three years i lived in california four

2299
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,880
years maybe i never saw a single indoor

2300
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:37,678
my friends or myself that ever had it

2301
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,239
yeah

2302
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,079
none that's crazy that's so nothing

2303
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:43,919
crazy and now it's like it and then once

2304
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,760
it became but then you if you if you

2305
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,079
think about it right imagine

2306
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:51,199
thousands of acres of grapes

2307
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,158
kicking off clouds as the highway drives

2308
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:54,399
by

2309
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:57,119
a pm that they can't treat

2310
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:59,599
jesus christ

2311
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,679
it just it just it just got all over

2312
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,320
people's [ __ ] tires it got kicked in

2313
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,359
the air it got all over the place and

2314
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,719
then

2315
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:08,079
it's like it's been i'm not saying that

2316
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,800
that's the only reason but it's been a

2317
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:12,559
problem ever since yeah in all honesty

2318
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,400
and then all those clones from norcal

2319
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,320
get spread out all over

2320
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:17,359
yeah and then people get pm and they

2321
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:19,759
don't know how to deal then they know

2322
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:22,719
how to get rid of it yeah

2323
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,960
and you know um and it's you know it's

2324
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:28,639
it's just one of those pathogens

2325
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,158
yeah it's it's obnoxious as [ __ ]

2326
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,159
it's it's evil

2327
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:34,559
i was just gonna run these by since

2328
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:36,319
we're winding down on time i was just

2329
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,840
looking these these were in the same bag

2330
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:40,960
with the cali mist and the bubble gum

2331
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,840
and stuff i actually was able recently

2332
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,279
to send a bunch of these back uh old uh

2333
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,279
spikes of life

2334
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:49,039
i have some old legend seeds actually my

2335
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:50,880
my last pack of the johnny blaze that

2336
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,560
people were mentioning i finally got the

2337
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,760
to get those back in the hands of red

2338
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,400
who made them

2339
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,880
so i think red might be making some new

2340
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:01,198
versions of the old legend seat stuff

2341
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,719
soon so people that were interested in

2342
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,599
those you might actually

2343
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,600
just come back to tuition

2344
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,560
legends was a good was a good company

2345
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
for

2346
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:13,520
a while there they had a bunch of good

2347
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,439
[ __ ] yeah right red spreads the [ __ ]

2348
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,960

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,760
yeah if people are listening

2356
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,479
ask questions right now yeah if you have

2357
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,440
a

2358
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,879
dying question that you have to ask

2359
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,158
can you speak on the highlights what's

2360
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,719
plant like how does it compare to the

2361
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,238
nl5 i'll do that real quick

2362
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,319
i also sent red back some legends

2363
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:46,479
ultimate indica dookie he also got the

2364
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,880
legends ultimate indica for me um

2365
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:50,718
hawaiian lights is

2366
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,639
oddly enough it's more afghani even than

2367
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:55,198
the nl5 it tends to be more broadleaf

2368
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,359
and expression um we saw some bubble

2369
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,799
looking types in it that weren't bubba

2370
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:01,119
smelling but they were just the the

2371
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,960
typical above a structure

2372
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,039
lots of resin production

2373
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:08,319
there was some color in these lots of

2374
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:11,359
tropical terps lots of pineapple

2375
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:13,519
just all through the the tropical range

2376
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:14,960
um

2377
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,360
trying to think of what the best way to

2378
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,760
describe that is but it's really hard

2379
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:22,799
tropical think tropical basically

2380
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:25,440
tropical afghani and that is essentially

2381
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,760
what hawaiian lights comes out like

2382
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:29,678
very variant but they all

2383
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,840
are pretty much broadleaf

2384
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,279
so yeah that's that's hawaiian lights in

2385
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,679
a nutshell we'll have caleb come on and

2386
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:37,519
talk more about it soon um

2387
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,079
we're going to be dropping the

2388
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,280
hybrids i believe this weekend

2389
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:42,559
i'm going to do my best i've been

2390
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,639
packaging a bunch trying to get through

2391
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,880
all the packages in order so once those

2392
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,560
are done then i'll add in the hawaiian

2393
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,239
lights hybrid so keep your eyes posted

2394
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,120
on writeseco.com

2395
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:54,718
and humboldtcsi.com for both so there's

2396
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:56,000
a couple there's a bunch of questions

2397
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,079
out um

2398
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,520
there's uh there was some stuff on

2399
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,880
leather chirps

2400
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,040
uh the a5 and some of the some of the

2401
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,239
rarer haze terps definitely have some

2402
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:08,639
leather in them

2403
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:11,279
uh animal and leather i actually kind of

2404
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:13,440
prefer that dark profile to like the

2405
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:17,039
super bright fruity

2406
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,559
terpenoline uh type of thing on it um

2407
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,880
you know there's there's haze lines

2408
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,639
available all over the trouble is just

2409
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,639
pulling out what you

2410
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,679
want out of them you know there's some

2411
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,239
america

2412
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,239
leather is also motor rebels heroin um

2413
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,919
his version of steep tucks arowana which

2414
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:33,678
is very different it's very there's a

2415
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,279
lot of leather in it there we go someone

2416
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,480
else just said it too yeah yeah and

2417
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:38,479
there's um

2418
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:40,879
there's you know there's some american

2419
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:42,479
seed companies that i won't that are

2420
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,400
uh you know

2421
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:46,479
that they're crossing things to cuban

2422
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:48,719
black and other haze things

2423
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:50,399
um there's obviously some european seed

2424
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,399
companies like shanti baba that have

2425
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:55,198
some stuff there's a big debate on what

2426
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,879
he's lost and what he's had but um you

2427
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,559
know you can definitely get it seems

2428
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,199
like the mango haze

2429
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,440
um is still really good from him

2430
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,599
um you know there's smaller breeders

2431
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,879
doing smaller work on hazes

2432
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,840
it definitely is easier to get a well i

2433
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,520
don't know easier to get but

2434
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,520
um you know there's there's good haze

2435
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,520
cuts out there that are starting to slip

2436
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,880
out a little bit more wide

2437
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,560
um yeah

2438
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,440
you know that kind of thing

2439
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,360
so

2440
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:25,678
you know uh people were talking about

2441
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:27,279
when did the first cookie pop out

2442
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,279
that's a whole show in itself but

2443
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,639
probably by probably like

2444
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:31,519
09 ish

2445
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,000
yeah

2446
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,199
i would say uh i can't talk about

2447
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,359
somebody mentioned the legitimacy of uh

2448
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:42,559
scott from rare danks neville's haze

2449
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:44,399
couldn't tell you just no idea uh you

2450
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,480
know neville's haze has been for sale

2451
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:48,079
for a long time if he used neville's

2452
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:49,519
haze from neville couldn't tell you what

2453
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:52,079
arrow was from

2454
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,120
um no information on that as far as that

2455
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,960
goes

2456
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:56,800
uh but

2457
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,800
you know um

2458
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,079
you know there's big debates people talk

2459
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,880
about newer

2460
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:04,158
newer releases of shanti's stuff don't

2461
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,319
have that

2462
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:08,638
um people always get that way sometimes

2463
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:10,319
i wonder if it doesn't have that or just

2464
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,679
you found it in one or two packs and

2465
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,759
then you go through five or six more

2466
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,920
packs looking for it you don't find it

2467
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,840
yeah is it in there

2468
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,520
did you just not see it that time yeah

2469
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,679
did the luck of the draw not pop up you

2470
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,840
know because it's it's a it's a super

2471
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,319
[ __ ] to find one that you want

2472
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,560
purple haze was a super famous

2473
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:31,599
um haze from the original

2474
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,120
um hayes lines from america you know

2475
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,840
they kind of sister

2476
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:37,439
they said they kind of bred it out on

2477
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,880
accident it was actually magenta haze on

2478
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:40,079
the poster now that i think about it

2479
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,719
magenta

2480
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:44,719
yeah you know um

2481
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,679
you know so the problem with haze is

2482
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,520
that it's hard to find keepers it's rare

2483
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,960
but there is a bunch of interest in it

2484
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,199
all of a sudden in the last two or three

2485
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,039
years and so that's gotten some american

2486
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:56,238
breeders collecting cuts and making

2487
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,880
hybrids

2488
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:01,439
um and you can find johnny come lately

2489
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,679
[ __ ] you know just just be

2490
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:04,559
prepared to hunt through some jungle

2491
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:07,520
weed

2492
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,920
and you know and don't don't let you

2493
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,840
know we should mention um we should

2494
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,920
mention that uh

2495
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,159
if we're talking about jungle weed there

2496
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,719
is a super famous cut

2497
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:21,198
of uh nl5 haze a

2498
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,039
i think in holland and it's called dr

2499
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,599
grinspoon

2500
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:28,000
it's it's called quays [ __ ]

2501
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,440
okay whatever quays dr grinspoon i'm

2502
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,920
just gonna say most people probably know

2503
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,399
it is one of the other it's not the same

2504
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,560
thing okay anyway quakes some call it

2505
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:38,399
place yes so

2506
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,400
the the point i was trying to make is

2507
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:43,198
when you watch this thing grow

2508
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:45,519
it's a million little calyxes like this

2509
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:48,479
[ __ ] big it's like the kind of thing

2510
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,920
where 99 of growers would cut that [ __ ]

2511
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:52,638
halfway through

2512
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:56,158
right it produces a million little

2513
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:58,079
one-hitter type bong rips yeah but the

2514
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,479
weed off it's unbelievable

2515
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:02,158
yeah so if you're growing haze

2516
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,319
don't go by looks

2517
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:05,759
yeah wait until you can smoke it and see

2518
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,079
what the effect is and see what the

2519
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:11,440
taste is yeah because some of the

2520
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:14,880
shittiest looking weed imaginable

2521
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:16,000
and i'm talking ugly like like like haze

2522
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,000

2523
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,639
ig photogenic

2524
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:25,760
no there is a lot of ugly haze brown

2525
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:27,279
shitty [ __ ] growth hairy looking but

2526
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,960
then you smoke it and it tears your head

2527
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,519
off and it tastes delicious and you're

2528
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,198
happy and giggling and life is good

2529
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,199
yeah so you really have to make sure

2530
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:37,039
don't don't give up early

2531
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:39,519
because that's what everybody does uh

2532
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:41,600
yeah i bloomed out the quays didn't keep

2533
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,840
cuts i was like what's this [ __ ] and i

2534
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,360
did pollinate it but i was like

2535
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:48,000
i mean you know neville even talked

2536
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:50,158
about like his favorite female

2537
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,158
he blooms it out and it took 20 weeks

2538
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,158
and he thought it was the hairiest

2539
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:54,960
ugliest never finishing piece of [ __ ]

2540
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:56,479
ever

2541
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,480
and he cut it down and he hung it in the

2542
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,238
corner and he killed the mom and then a

2543
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:01,439
month later he made some hash out of it

2544
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:02,799
he said it was some of the best we've

2545
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:05,678
ever smoked in his life and he still

2546
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,279
regretted losing it yeah but by looks it

2547
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,319
was the ugliest piece of [ __ ] he'd ever

2548
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:09,519
seen

2549
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:11,439
yeah

2550
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,199
you know so you can't judge hayes hey

2551
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:14,559
this is not cookie haze is not

2552
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:16,559
photogenic

2553
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,080
he's what you're going for with haze is

2554
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,199
taste and effect

2555
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,079
yeah

2556
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:23,359
you know it's gonna be a gnarly big ugly

2557
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:25,519
plant you could get some pretty ones

2558
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:28,000
it's not impossible

2559
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,840
but don't give up if it looks hideous

2560
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,560
yeah there's only a few people i've seen

2561
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:35,440
make pure haze look photogenic and very

2562
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:37,039
very few yeah and then on top of that

2563
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:38,638
what's gonna happen more often than not

2564
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,319
is that ugly piece of [ __ ] that you held

2565
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,520
onto that you had dreams for that was

2566
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:42,880
going to be it isn't it and then it's

2567
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,400
just an ugly piece of [ __ ] you know and

2568
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,920
you're like yeah okay because that

2569
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:47,359
happened to me quite a bit too you know

2570
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,359
it's like i buy all this neville's haze

2571
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:51,920
and it takes me [ __ ] forever to do it

2572
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:53,920
and it's like 14 18 whatever weeks and

2573
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:57,279
then i'm like oh i don't want to keep it

2574
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,960
yeah no i will i will say like i never

2575
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,719
really rocked rare dateless stuff just

2576
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,560
because the guy was a dick to me

2577
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,319
but um

2578
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,440
a lot of people do like the moonshine

2579
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:09,840
haze i i got to smoke it once at uh one

2580
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:11,519
of the jennifer cannabis cups at some

2581
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,560
mad ball or something i can't remember

2582
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,120
who was playing but it was some punk

2583
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,520
rock show and it was it was pretty good

2584
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:19,198
not gonna lie even as biased as i am it

2585
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,880
was pretty good for a [ __ ] haze i

2586
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:23,119
think rich did a good job on the moon if

2587
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,960
you limit your seeds to only people you

2588
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:26,639
think you like you're really limiting

2589
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,600
your seeds in cannabis

2590
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,679
yeah

2591
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,719
yeah very much so

2592
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:35,119
much sometimes weirdos and and [ __ ]

2593
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,719
and whatnot sometimes they pop out fire

2594
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,119
yeah you know

2595
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,480
yeah and yeah i don't even know dude so

2596
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:42,399
i'm not even dissing him i'm just saying

2597
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:44,799
that you know that

2598
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:46,399
that uh um it's tough that's what makes

2599
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,639
haze tough it's tough to find and so

2600
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:51,759
it's cool that people are trying to make

2601
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:53,920
like more accessible hazes and then it's

2602
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,440
kind of gaining in popularity again

2603
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,039
especially from some of these smaller

2604
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:58,799
seed companies and people trying to pump

2605
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:01,519
it in new york because

2606
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:05,760
um that'll keep it alive

2607
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:07,520
you need periodic booms of interest

2608
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,719
to keep things going

2609
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,480
yeah

2610
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,600
you know you really i said when i was

2611
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:15,839
selling pith nobody wanted it and now

2612
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,760
it's very in demand i wish i would have

2613
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,239
sat on those seeds

2614
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,159
froze them you know till now but that's

2615
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:24,718
not how [ __ ] works yeah

2616
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:27,359

yeah um than you would in in skunk one

2637
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:07,519
that's for sure gunk one you people have

2638
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,560
probably pushed it to its limit

2639
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,320
yeah

2640
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,600
hey is there still surprises and people

2641
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:13,599
ask i should just remember because it

2642
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,600
popped into my head people asked about

2643
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,120
the band-aid haze seven

2644
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,679
yes because that's a cut that floats

2645
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:22,079
around i will say that people i respect

2646
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,480
like yo sami in europe and others

2647
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:28,238
have told me they view that cut

2648
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:30,000
as equal to the old cuts that they hold

2649
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:33,359
that's pretty cool so it's the first

2650
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,560
haze in a long time that they feel

2651
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:38,719
is as good and stands right there with

2652
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,320
those old 25 30 year old strains that

2653
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,760
have been kept forever that's

2654
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,119
interesting and it's a lot more

2655
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,639
accessible to people yeah uh in in you

2656
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:48,000
know in america than a lot of these

2657
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:49,760
other ones that i talk about these

2658
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,679
things are i should mention people think

2659
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,920
i'm connected or whatever i have been

2660
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:57,600
[ __ ] hunting all of these european

2661
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:59,679
haze cuts since the 90s yeah

2662
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,920
you know and it it was like the white

2663
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,279
rabbit it was like multi decades of

2664
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,359
looking

2665
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:07,198
yeah and there's still some like that

2666
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:08,479
neville taste cut i want that thing so

2667
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:10,238
bad

2668
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:11,919
um i know where it is

2669
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:13,599
i can't get it

2670
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,560
you know if it's in america i don't know

2671
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,039
about it

2672
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,159
yeah um you know but uh anyway the

2673
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:22,079
band-aid hey seven is an amazing cut

2674
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,479
uh amazing effect they're growing it

2675
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,639
over in europe they love it it's easier

2676
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,359
to get in america than the rest of them

2677
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:31,920
yeah it does take forever you know so be

2678
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:34,880
prepared to go 14 weeks or whatever

2679
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:39,039
um but it's a it's a fire cut by all

2680
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:40,719
accounts yeah um and uh i believe that's

2681
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:45,198
cuban black

2682
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:48,000
uh haze cross to a5 tai

2683
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:48,799
i believe so yeah whatever cuban black

2684
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
is

2685
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:54,719
but yeah so whatever so it's possible

2686
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,679
that you know it's that it's it's a c5

2687
01:33:54,719 --> 01:34:00,800
cut by an a5 cut by some a thai male to

2688
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:03,600
provide pollen maybe maybe yeah but

2689
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,520
whatever case may be um there's a cut

2690
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,280
you can still buy band-aid hay seeds

2691
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,040
there's various versions of them

2692
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,840
and there's at least this one cut that

2693
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,519
came out uh elite status

2694
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,840
yeah and the people that have been

2695
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,360
running um a lot of these hazes for 30

2696
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,600
years if they think it's as good as the

2697
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:21,359
rest of them

2698
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,079
you know that's pretty high praise from

2699
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:24,399
them

2700
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:25,840
yeah yeah adoptee is doing a lot of work

2701
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,599
that he's a good dude

2702
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,840
so you know

2703
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,360
um yeah we did talk about tom hill just

2704
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,480
in in brief

2705
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:36,479
uh not very not for very long um

2706
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:38,559
you know but tom hill did release did

2707
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,678
have tom hill hayes

2708
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,039
and did have tom uh hey tom hill haze by

2709
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:45,520
deep chunk

2710
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:48,880
and uh maybe some other more work around

2711
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:52,560
that yeah and i believe all of his stuff

2712
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:54,800
descends from positronics haze lines

2713
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,159
the fuzzy brown is is

2714
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,639
kind of saying that you're wrong about

2715
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:01,439
a5 and c5 not existing i don't think

2716
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:02,239
he's confused no they definitely exist

2717
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:03,599
yeah

2718
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:05,359
they definitely exist but what i'm

2719
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,039
saying is that there's there's various

2720
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:08,639
haze cuts that i know are alive in

2721
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:10,319
europe and i don't know if they're alive

2722
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:12,800
here

2723
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:14,399
yeah there's a5 and c5 that have popped

2724
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,000
up in america and there's a number of

2725
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,759
people that have them

2726
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,679
um there's still politics around

2727
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,920
releasing seed around it

2728
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:24,719
uh or trading it or whatever so they're

2729
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,440
still tough so they're alive um some of

2730
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,920
them

2731
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:29,039
actually to be said uh some of them have

2732
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,199
uh

2733
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:33,600
some of them have the virus

2734
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:35,839
yeah so be careful

2735
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,600
yeah i haven't run the sssc hazes

2736
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,039
someone's asking about but

2737
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,119
um

2738
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:42,719
that's a good thing to mention because

2739
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:45,039
one of the things that's interesting is

2740
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,079
almost all the haze that's available

2741
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:48,079
is

2742
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:51,359
based off of neville's work which is a

2743
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:53,359
couple of males yeah right or some posi

2744
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:55,599
work or whatever but neville's seems to

2745
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,920
be the stuff that everybody found firing

2746
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,199
yeah and when we interviewed corel um

2747
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,520
corel had

2748
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:03,839
a they had a and it's been confirmed by

2749
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,600
friends of mine he has a 35 plus year

2750
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,480
old skunk haze

2751
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,520
yeah that he made from haze seeds given

2752
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:11,118
to him

2753
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,119
yeah and what's interesting about if you

2754
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:14,799
were to get karel's work and cross it to

2755
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:17,920
some of neville's work

2756
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:20,800
is that it's not neville's males

2757
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,840
yeah it's another genetic of haze

2758
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,039
yeah so it's not quite the same

2759
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,199
bottleneck yep

2760
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:28,560
um whatsoever

2761
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:30,000
you know because haze doesn't like being

2762
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,199
crossed to itself

2763
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,198
so

2764
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:35,439
and it's from that same batch of seed

2765
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:38,000
that neville got

2766
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:39,919
you know yeah so i didn't really realize

2767
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,679
that until we talked to him yeah that

2768
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,679
was a mind blower

2769
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,158
but his ssc

2770
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,600
hybrids off that skunk haze should be a

2771
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:50,238
completely different haze that's been

2772
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,639
available up until recently yeah

2773
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:53,599
but from the same seats from the same

2774
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,520
area

2775
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,600
i i'm gonna be really excited with some

2776
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,960
new outdoor space to finally run some of

2777
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,119
my ace collection and other [ __ ] stoped

2778
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,039
finally get to pop the sssc stuff

2802
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:55,279
um but what's great is that it seems

2803
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:57,359
like from uh from a line that was

2804

you remember

2818
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,639

i almost want to say people might get me

2822
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,399
wrong but it's like it's uh uh

2823
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:39,759
the stew might be from jersey or

2824
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:40,879
something close somewhere in that new

2825
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:44,079
york region

2826
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,600

2830
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,359
little different than sweet skunk and

2831
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:57,679
then mark emery did this thing

2832
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:00,319
uh you know that confused the lineage of

2833
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,359
it um but as far as we can tell there is

2834
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:03,759
a real

2835
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:06,319
um there is a real sweet skunk that was

2836
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,440
basically mostly nl5 haze

2837
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:10,559
yeah

2838
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:12,799
and it got caught did did did uh

2839
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,000
um steve cross it to like grapefruit or

2840
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,000
something

2841
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,679
or yeah i don't know what it was crossed

2842
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,158
here

2843
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:22,960
so you know anyway um

2844
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:24,638
the uh you know fork you know so it's

2845
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,480
it's cool in the sense that there's a

2846
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:28,960
bunch of different phenos

2847
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:31,678
yeah that have survived

2848
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,520
you know um all females obviously we

2849
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,800

nl5 hayes male pollen

2852
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:42,319

2853
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,239
yeah we have uh one of our buddies um

2854

kim blackburn is is a part of the cough

2855
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:49,519
crew so we have people closer to the cop

2856
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:51,279
that know the history of it real well so

2857
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,800

2858
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:56,238

um the new york stuff exists strawberry

2876
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,600

was called electric bugaloo

2904
01:41:19,118 --> 01:41:24,238
yeah you know what sucks is like i was

2908
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:32,079
electric boogaloo but i know

2909
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,359
most people won't even associate that

2910
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:34,399
with the dog [ __ ] cut and they'll just

2911
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:36,079
sit there

2912
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:37,759
you know yeah

2913
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:39,760
you know it'll just sit there but but

2914
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,920
electric boogaloo is like

2915
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,840
one of the all-time great names

2916
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,840

2941
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:42,639
there we go

2942
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:44,158
i mean one of the things i should say

2943
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:46,319
about one of the things that draws

2944
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,399
people to hayes is that

2945
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:51,599
we live in an indica dominated it's like

2946
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:53,118
the exact opposite of the 70s and 80s

2947
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,920
uh where

2948
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:57,920
excuse me where sativa ruled the game

2949
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,679
yeah we live in an indica and indica

2950
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,719
dominant scene

2951
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:04,480
yeah

2952
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:07,520
and hayes is a tie back to that ancient

2953
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:09,839
you know uh no longer available import

2954
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,400
and it seems like it gives people a

2955
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:14,639
better high in a different way

2956
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:16,960
it has a different high profile it hits

2957
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,880
people and even if people are extremely

2958
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:21,679
used to and experienced with smoking

2959
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:23,679
chems or you know ogs or whatever you

2960
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:26,719
can smoke some haze

2961
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:28,880
and have it hit you like a brick

2962
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:31,198
um so even though it's ugly and takes a

2963
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,359
long time and has these various issues

2964
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,678
uh it's popular for my favorite reason

2965
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:37,039
for weed to be popular

2966
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:39,679
because it works good

2967
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:42,238
yeah effect it works good

2968
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:44,480
you know so that's the best reason to to

2969
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:46,399
like weed it's weed that works

2970
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:47,519
weed that works

2971
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:50,079
you know

2972
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:52,800
