1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,318
so i decided to do a quick video

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,759
about the cosmic boogie poster i know

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,839
there is a website out there

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,040
that goes over each individual little

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,638
thing on it

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,718
but a lot of people have not been able

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
to find really good

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,839
you know images about it or of it

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
um it's really hard to find it's

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,000
impossible to find an original

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,278
this is an original um but i want to go

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
over it with you for all you haze

13
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,240
fanatics and strain [ __ ] out there

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,518
so you can see what what makes this

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,359
poster so special

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,799
so first we have the signs of the zodiac

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,558
if you look

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,078
scorpio that's all i know because i mean

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,799
leo

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,799
the [ __ ] or whatever that is some

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,558
scales and weed

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,759
yeah so they have the constellations up

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,000
here i'm not sure let's see what that is

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,000
not quite sure what that is i can't tell

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,399
oh it's just a bud

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,359
it's just a tall but i forget that's how

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,359
hayes looked

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,679
um yeah so we got that

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
it references the silver and the blue

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,799
haze

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
it references magenta and gold those are

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,118
the four original types of haze

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,359
the original haze connoisseur's choice

34
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,359
cultivated california cannabis

35
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,559
let's see what it says right here let's

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
get it to

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,560
focus for you i can't quite get it to

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,560
focus

39
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:39,438
in nature we trust americana

40
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:42,399
1976 no seeds

41
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,399
my favorite part

42
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:49,118
honest weight there's the scales

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,759
because you know back then people would

44
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:54,560
[ __ ] [ __ ] with the weights

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,200
warning in some states cannabis is

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
illegal

47
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
all right here we go the cosmic boogie

48
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,478
1976 now the cosmic boogie this is where

49
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,118
it gets its uh

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,959
name from the poster in clandestine

51
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,639
location sparsely scattered throughout

52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,079
california a few dedicated farmers

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,399
cultivate the herb cannabis

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,920
as a way of life anyone can grow weeds

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
and see the virgin greens but to

56
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,639
cultivate the exotic queens beyond your

57
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,318
dreams

58
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,878
you should have dedication sensitivity

59
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,159
to plant life consistency and a little

60
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
basic knowledge

61
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,479
good karma and a great desire to find

62
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,878
harmony with mama nature

63
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,479
the basis for any strong healthy plant

64
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,399
is the soil it grows in

65
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,639
resin producing herbs grow best in soil

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,280
that is neutral to semi-sweet

67
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,799
uh larger the bush or tree whatever it

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
may be the larger the root structure

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,719
needed to support it

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,719
roots develop mostly freely in a loose

71
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,519
rich soil makes one yard of soil

72
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,159
compound

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
of 30 mushroom compost 30 redwood

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,159
sawdust

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,640
40 sandy loam topsoil mix organic

76
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:58,158
nutrients three pounds of

77
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,359
what does that say boof three pounds of

78
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,679
hoof and horn meal three pounds of boof

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
hoof and horn mill five pounds of rock

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
phosphate four pounds of kelp one pound

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,238
natural compost

82
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:14,000
one pound soil iron uh five pounds

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,800
gypsum and five pounds of dolomite

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,639
this is supposed to be the recipe they

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,439
use to grow the haze

86
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,119
who knows mix soil and minerals

87
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,680
thoroughly and let sit for at least one

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
week

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
then check the soil with the soil

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,439
testing kit for ph and add

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,680
agricultural lime to bring ph to 7.5 to

92
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,359
8.5

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
spring arrives and with it comes new

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,239
life fresh spirit and a great hope for

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
the new crop

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,400
plant your favorite seeds on the 6th or

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,799
7th of april the moon is in cancer best

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,840
signed for planting above ground herbs

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,840
in may the 3rd 4th and 5th are good

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,158
if you're still not together try june

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
8th and 9th while the moon is in scorpio

102
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,280
when you irrigate make sure that the

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
moon is in one of these signs

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
when possible cancer is the most

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
excellent time to irrigate

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
taurus scorpio and pisces are also good

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,920
for irrigation

108
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,079
pruning should be done only in the third

109
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,119
quarter patience is the real secret and

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
the true test

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
try to make it until december 10th or

112
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,958
11th when the moon is in leo and harvest

113
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,919
conditions are perfect so you can dig it

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,959
in nature we trust the spirit of 76 and

115
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:20,000
it says right here copyright

116

and this is signed by uh grantedy mike

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
he raffled this off uh

119
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,399
i think a seattle hempfest or something

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
that's where this got loosened from his

121
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,478
grips

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,160
