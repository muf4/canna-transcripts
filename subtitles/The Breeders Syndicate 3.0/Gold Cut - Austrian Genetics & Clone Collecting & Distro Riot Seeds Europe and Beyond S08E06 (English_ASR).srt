it all started with with the Cannabis

46
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,618
culture here in Indiana uh you have to

47
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,019

was no there was no wheat okay we didn't

49
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,959
had seeds uh your sauce for cannabis

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
products well it was either a a hash bar

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,718
a legal hash bar so not like a coffee

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,399
shop in Amsterdam where you go and you

53
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,219
can order and everything now it was

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,939
illegal you had to wait for

55
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:18,000
a half hour and six hours to get your

56
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,400
Moroccan mostly Moroccan hash wow that's

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,699
where we all where we all used to Source

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,159
our cannabis uh and you can imagine no

59
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,079
one was very pleased with going there

60
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,919
yeah

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,800
was it illegal cash bar or legal

62
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:37,079
illegal it was it was it was like the

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,319
front was like a normal cafe or a shady

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,000
comic rundown Cafe

65
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,699
but you had to wait like for two hours

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,120
to to then uh

67
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,979
to then buy cannabis or buy a hash from

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,378
a dealer that suddenly appeared out of

69
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,780
nowhere

70
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:56,699
and uh until a certain time where

71
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,739
everybody was fed up with that you know

72
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,818
I can remember

73
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:05,099
and uh it started it started uh I think

74
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:08,098
it started with with me buying High

75
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,439
Times magazines and seeing all those you

76
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:13,738
know amazing plants and amazing flowers

77
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,500
and was like dude okay there's actually

78
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,620
flower out there that

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,598
I have to Source somehow yeah

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,080
and that's how I started with various

81
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,299
people who uh either got seeds from some

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,659
someone or

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,340
uh ordered them or went to Amsterdam and

84
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:34,979
brought something back

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,620
um I collected bags it's back then from

86
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,359
people who brought weed back from I

87
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,299
think most of it was from Holland you

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,760
know and some of it was just hippie

89
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,620
back seats you know from some some dude

90
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,840
from somewhere

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,680
but uh it started with back seats that

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,239
are collected and uh because I'm I'm a

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,519
professional Gardener I mean I did

94
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,200
apprenticeship and uh I have a master's

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,620
degree in gardening and in landscape

96
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,139
value yeah I I started to collect those

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,759
seeds and at one point I was like

98
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,458
hey you know what

99
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,280
my mom has I lived with my mom back then

100
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,719
she had a garden

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,319
in a

102
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,478
in a public housing home a house yeah we

103
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,060
had a we had an apartment in a in a

104
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,240
public housing uh complex here in the

105
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,819
outskirts of Vienna and I started most

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,259
of the seeds I had it was a big ass bag

107
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,259
full of mixed bags

108
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,680
I end up with I don't know 200 different

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,780
plants yeah how did Mom like that

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,819
mom was first like what is this

111
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,579
beautiful she had no problems with it

112
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,099
yeah but at a certain point it was just

113
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:50,698
it pissed her off because she had to

114
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,180
water them while I was at work out you

115
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,180
know yeah

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,860
that's amazing from there on I think it

117
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,859
started to yeah because I was blown away

118
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,319
by the varieties and you know everything

119
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,199
was like okay this is a whole different

120
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,659
world yeah and then we started to buy

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
seeds I think the first seeds were from

122
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,139
a shop here

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,199
which were

124
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,079
I think senses most of them

125
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,120
and probably positronics and other stuff

126
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,599
that they bought in bulk and then

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,220
repackaged into smaller five units or

128
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,220
ten you know yeah

129
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,320
so we bought those seeds and

130
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,259
and started from there when I bought my

131
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,180
first HPS super expensive huge [ __ ]

132
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,240
thing and yeah we started and

133
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,038
unfortunately the guy that uh did this

134
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,319
first couple tries

135
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,180
turned out to be a kleptomaniac and got

136
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,478
busted because his Cellar was full of

137
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,478
stolen [ __ ] and yeah I almost got busted

138
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,959
too and man it was a wake-up call my

139
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,758
first problems with the law and but uh

140
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,279
you know um

141
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,560
I never stopped from there

142
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,119
you know that's the way to do it man I

143
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,038
mean like once you get the bug it's a

144
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,600
little hard to stop once you see all

145
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,639
these beautiful plants and you you've

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,860
popped like 200 seeds and you see what

147
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,840
what the potential is it's really hard

148
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,160
to back it off and just be like I'm done

149
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,159
from here on

150
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,979
yeah you know and and especially I never

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,800
I never questioned it I questioned it

152
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:25,978
you know I never asked myself

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,079
oh this is a good idea or not

154
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:31,258
it was just a very natural progression

155
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,680
and the love for gardening I mean I'm a

156
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:37,800
gardener you know so it was it was just

157
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,079
natural that blackma where I did my

158
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,300
apprenticeship the boss told me Dan you

159
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,258
have to specialize in something if you

160
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,240
want to

161
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,580
want to stay gardening you know to keep

162
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,879
on gardening and being a gardener you

163
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:53,339
have to specialize in the field and be

164
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,860
the best you can be in this in this

165
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,060
absolutely be the best wow so he was

166
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,639
telling you to specialize in something

167
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,459
specific and and to be the best at it

168
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,900
possible I asked that's probably the

169
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,638
best advice anybody could give because

170
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,159
realistically in this world if you're

171
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,720
not the best at what you do it's very

172
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
hard to make a name unless you're rich

173
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,139
and can afford tons of advertising

174
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,019
that's the only way around being the

175
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,478
best at what you do and pure skill yeah

176
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:22,439
at that point I was a you know a

177
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:25,019
youngster and I had no idea how how this

178
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,300
will work in the future for me but I

179
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,060
continued as a gardener and I

180
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,819
specialized in being a landscape a

181
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,240
cardinal and arborist and cutting trees

182
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:40,319
and cutting fruit trees yeah

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,900
and at one one day after almost 10 years

184
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,139
working as a landscape Gardener and and

185
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,818
and tree Mason or however you guys call

186
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,819
it yeah

187
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,759
um I met an old Carly who once worked

188
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,979
with me and he kind of introduced me to

189
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,840
the legal cannabis industry in Austria

190
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:01,258
because I was not aware

191
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,359
for me you know going to shops was kind

192
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,400
of sketchy I was yeah I had this old

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,120
school mentality where I would not go to

194
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,519
a shop and you know

195
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,879
disclose myself kind of yeah

196
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,219
so I was doing my cannabis thing but

197
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,939
away from all those shops who started to

198
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,580
sell uh season and clothes you know they

199
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,699
started to have their copper strains

200
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:29,399
that they sell sold these clones

201
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,960
and this guy said to me hey dude you

202
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,360
should take a look at the this one

203
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,278
company where I worked

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,658
um they're producing cannabis plants and

205
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,059
I was like are you [ __ ] kidding me

206
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,338
dude what do you mean canvas plans

207
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,838
yeah come there we need gardeners you

208
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,360
know they are looking for gardeners in

209
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,820
your very good Governor because he knew

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,600
me how I worked as a landscape Gardener

211
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,480
and yeah and you know in general as uh

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,879
is it the gardener who I am

213
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,080
and I went there and

214
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:03,659
I was kind of surprised how rudimentary

215
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,278
everything was and how they worked you

216
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:07,079
know how they thought the production

217
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,240
should look like

218
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,940
without said to myself you know what

219
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,980
after 10 years busting your ass in the

220
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,940
cold in every weather outside and

221
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,159
climbing trees and sweating and full of

222
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,000
two-stroke fumes and [ __ ] yeah right

223
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,399
you know as a set of myself dude why not

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,559
just giving it a chance if you don't

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,839
like it you can still come back

226
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,299
and do what you did the last 10 years

227
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,100
yeah yeah but I had no perspective I

228
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,319
didn't really have a perspective in

229
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,580
landscape gardening and cutting trees

230
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,760
but

231
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,580
I later found out that that the the the

232
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,299
the skill of cutting trees the right way

233
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,060
helped me a lot in in shaping mother

234
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:55,919
plants and doing it yeah

235
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:58,979
gave me the best you know basic based on

236
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,500
uh basis on on how to continue and learn

237
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,480
how to improve and

238
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,339
yeah and I started working there and

239
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,560
worked there for around I think six

240
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,420
years or long seven years

241
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,979
and that's a major producer the biggest

242
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,500
producer back then the biggest

243
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,820
production company in Central Europe for

244
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,320
legal THC clones wow what kind of clones

245
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,519
are they producing at the time like what

246
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,800
kind of strains

247
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,139
man they had a lot of stuff when I

248
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,179
started there they had mostly the

249
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,639
selections that kind of were passed on

250
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,278
from shop to shop or some people started

251
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,980
a 10 pack of I don't know shiva's skunk

252
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,259
or yeah yeah Afghani Delight or White

253
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,959
Russian or whatever yeah and so they

254
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,159
started with those and it kind of went

255
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,639
from there

256
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,500
and I remember at a certain point you

257
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,720
know the strains that we were offering

258
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,480
were played out and everything was

259
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,759
it was I remember it was studying back

260
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,379
there you know yeah yeah those were

261
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,379
already [ __ ] genetics

262
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,399
yeah even back then because it was mass

263
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,440
produced and the symptoms I remember

264
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,980
with you know exactly what we are

265
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,500
talking about today but still still was

266
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,740
sold in

267
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:16,620
pretty pretty big amounts and uh and I

268
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,839
could see it getting bigger and bigger

269
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,659
month after month and more and more and

270
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,760
more because we were producing reliables

271
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,419
you know you could come to the shop do

272
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:31,019
your pre-order place a down payment on

273
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,519
on your order and and I don't know three

274
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,759
weeks from there you could pick up your

275
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:39,000
order in discrete boxes and

276
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,919
so yeah it continued to grow and grow

277
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,860
and we started to

278
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:46,019

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,260
canopy they'll say they're cannabis

336
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,078
people because they sold weed but really

337
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,360
they were they were not and

338
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:18,179
um the middleman not being really good

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,639
at what they did they hired me to

340
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:23,638
consult to on this reversal so I go to

341
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,659
look and it's at a grape farm and EV and

342
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,060
it's

343
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:29,039
in flour it's two weeks into flower

344
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,559
outdoors and they said yeah so can we

345
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,879
reverse this and I said are you what are

346
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,919
you talking about like you should have

347
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,159
been doing this so I had to teach these

348
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,659
guys how to [ __ ] re-vege Outdoors

349
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,639
which is you know what I mean like in

350
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,000
these big greenhouses I had to get them

351
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,060
to buy all these lights Revenge 13 000

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,320
plants so that we could actually use the

353
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,078
same plants and redo it because they

354
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,899
didn't want to kill anything but it was

355
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,059
like the ad people there are very good

356
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,220
at growing grapes they were Masters at

357
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,719
growing grapes so they thought that they

358
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,519
could easily apply this to cannabis

359
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,420
because if stoners can do it why can't

360
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,240
they

361
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:09,778
and that kind of mindset [ __ ]

362
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,519
pervaded all of it all of it every time

363
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,458
anything I said it would be like well

364
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,860
well you know we do it this way and I'm

365
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,539
like well I know what's effective you

366
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,740
hired me to consult you're paying me a

367
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,198
lot of money because so you might want

368
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,839
to take some advice yeah that's what

369
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,759
you're paying for yeah yeah I was it was

370
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,579
it was bought and it was also super

371
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,039
Shady you know that the CBD industry

372
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:36,138
especially with

373
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:41,099
I mean producing flowers with 0.2 and 10

374
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:42,839
CBD yeah yeah yeah right and that's

375
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,339
that's the way it worked in America

376
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,839
and like for a long time we weren't

377
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,699
allowed to talk about it because it was

378
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,519
almost akin to like airing out the

379
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:52,319
industry but the problem was it sunk our

380
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,519
industry letting a bunch of these Chads

381
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,560
growing hemp

382
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,259
grow a bunch of THD in their fields

383
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,759
shittily and then they try to and they

384
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,860
didn't try to they dropped that shitty

385
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,299
weed on the black market and crashed the

386
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,860
black market with it because it was just

387
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,859
so pervasive and all throughout the US

388
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,600
and so

389
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,759
they were growing they were growing CBD

390
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,220
flowers and hemp flowers that would

391
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,919
kind of similar or they were working

392
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,519
towards having or offering CBD flower

393
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:23,879
that is kind of similar to uh to Amnesia

394
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,360
so Black Market buyers could buy cheap

395
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,458
hemp mix it with real Amnesia and drop

396
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,980
it on the black market you know oh Jesus

397
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:35,000
Christ who the [ __ ] comes up with ideas

398
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:38,278
like that the hemp industry

399
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,320
they found a way to cut weed to like cut

400
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,720
it like like cocaine with yeah that's

401
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,540
horrible that is horrible

402
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,759
so that was also something where uh you

403
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,740
know I saw things where I said to myself

404
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,620
that's enough you know

405
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,240
you you got paid really good but and you

406
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,278
know it was a great experience and

407
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,459
learning a lot but

408
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:01,919
uh also heard a call from my CDA you

409
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:04,918
have to come back yeah and the the

410
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,859
person I worked now for now uh made an

411
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,079
offer that I thought was was good at

412
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,479
that point and also brought me back to

413
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,639
my family because I I have a

414
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,279
six-year-old boy and I wanted to come

415
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,699
back home and be with him more and not

416
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:24,899
spend I mean I drove into almost two

417
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:27,120
years I drove almost 70 000 kilometers

418
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,880
with [ __ ] car that I got from

419
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,619
them you know Jesus was too much driving

420
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,240
yeah no

421
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,558
no you're not you're not a long distance

422
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,140
trucker bro you don't need to be driving

423
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,259
all alone so I came back and that's

424
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,780
where I'm right now and I think when I

425
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,339
came back a couple months later we kind

426
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:48,000
of got into

427
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:50,519
talking about the idea of

428
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,038
um of bringing Riot seeds to Central

429
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,859
Europe yeah but I felt a certain need

430
00:17:53,038 --> 00:18:01,019
because I saw what's going on in in

431
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:03,298
Europe and even though some of it is

432
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:06,000
some of the stuff that is happening with

433
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:08,519
new genetics or new crosses some of it

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,859
is is I think is good I don't want to

435
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,839
talk down on everything there will be

436
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:17,279
just pure hating and [ __ ] yeah yeah

437
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:20,220
but I thought I saw a bottleneck I saw

438
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:23,160
it just [ __ ] breaking it down to

439
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,400
two or three things that were a high

440
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,980
beast and everything was

441
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,798
obscure couldn't you know I couldn't

442
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,740
uh you know I was like what the [ __ ] is

443
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,139
this is [ __ ] and how it's

444
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:42,000
that you know how the way it's going

445
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:44,460
yeah so I really felt the need to

446
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,380
and also with the legalization in your

447
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,700
country and things happening here in

448
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:54,980
Central Europe I really felt the need to

449
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:58,140
a threaten me to kind of

450
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,819
start really thinking about what we are

451
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,660
doing and how we can improve it for

452
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,939
everybody or kind of not be part of the

453
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,120
problem it sounds cheesy I know and I

454
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,940
said that often but I really don't uh in

455
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,579
my future work

456
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,740
and we all did [ __ ] in the past and

457
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,798
made mistakes that's normally especially

458
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:24,779
in cannabis for me

459
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:27,359
um we as I have to think about

460
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,460
being part of a better solution and and

461
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,859
kind of working towards this way and

462
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,940
that's I think uh was part of the

463
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:38,399
decision via why we we got married yeah

464
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,980
that we got married and this is and it

465
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,259
was important to me one I I don't exist

466
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,058
in the European market so much because I

467
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,500
just don't have people that I trusted

468
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,660
over there in the first place like I

469
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,099
know people over there

470
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,019
um but I've had

471
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,939
fallouts with a lot of people over there

472
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,940
you know Karma and all the rest it's

473
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,960
it's it's bad

474
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,900
um

475
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,279
I would like you maybe to talk some

476
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,860
about

477
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,019
maybe expand a little more on what

478
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,178
you've seen and how it's gone down with

479
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,220
as far as U.S breeders who is Big over

480
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,360
there who who are you seeing big over

481
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,000
there

482
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,759
so it changed a lot from being people

483
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,460
being super skeptic and just throwing

484
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:24,058
their staple [ __ ] European things or

485
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,120
the five I don't know white widow a

486
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:29,519
decent dad and they didn't they were

487
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,639
like no [ __ ] all this other [ __ ] we

488
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,200
are happy with what we have amnesia

489
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,240
amnesia yeah it was a staple European

490
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,120
strain and still strong good people

491
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,819
really enjoy

492
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:44,038
but at one point

493
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:46,200
uh people got really curious because you

494
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,538
legalized and you had this medical thing

495
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,240
and me too I was super curious that's

496
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:55,140
why I connected globally and started my

497
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,538
network and uh but you know people got

498
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,460
curious and from there on it started

499
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:02,839
into different directions some people

500
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,519
offered the real deal or kind of made

501
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,038
did all the work and and put in the

502
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,558
effort to introduce people to the real

503
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:13,140
deal or some authentic cards or you know

504
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:17,220
yeah and the others were selling uh

505
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:21,480
selling a dream or just an

506
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:24,900
what the market was was streaming for we

507
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,660
want Cali yeah I can't hear this you

508
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,360
know it's really nice to you guys no no

509
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,380
yeah the word Kelly you know how often

510
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,538
people refer to Kelly yeah and and so

511
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,400
some of the some of those companies some

512
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:39,779
of those companies that are also not

513
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,840
from the states

514
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:45,960
who are based in Spain also started to

515
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:50,538
you know bring in those names

516
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,538
but how authentic they were I don't know

517
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,500
yeah and also the seeds you know the

518
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,860
seeds that they sell

519
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,019
how authentic are those cuts uh those

520
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,879
those seeds and the cuts that they use

521
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,440
to produce those seeds

522
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,760
I think it's

523
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,798
it's often it's often really it's sad

524
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,500
dude that some of the people who who

525
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,200
crave for let's say just a Saudis okay

526
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,019
yes and they buy some random Spain don't

527
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,840
know Sour Diesel

528
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,658
from a company that buys them in bark

529
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,639
from a from a producer somewhere yeah

530
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,580
yeah

531
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,100
and they expect this to be Sour Diesel

532
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:35,579
sure and and there are 50 friends

533
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:38,099
expected okay this is how these yeah and

534
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:41,158
another 100 from there expect the label

535
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:44,459
that says Saudis did we saw diesel

536
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,440
and you know it's it's apples and and

537
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,740
and and and

538
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,798
bananas it's so different it's crazy

539
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,679
and yeah so some of the names you you

540
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,879
probably know are are pushing really

541
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,360
hard

542
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,179
towards towards uh this need for for

543
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,359
Californian

544
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:09,240
uh or or American names yeah

545
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,158
how authentic a lot of those are I don't

546
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,038
know because I haven't tried a lot of

547
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,860
them sure I tried a couple and none of

548
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,720
it was even close yeah

549
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,798
um and and

550
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,579
now especially now I see now I see a lot

551
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:30,000
of uh things that I thought were already

552
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:33,058
a thing of the Past coming back all the

553
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,940
skittle crosses okay um yeah all the

554
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:39,960
rainbow shirt crosses

555
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:43,500
um yeah just just Cherry gelato and

556
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,460
Lemon Cherry gelato lemon and

557
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,500
yeah those those things are but we are

558
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,340
talking about

559
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,919
a special car it doesn't special say

560
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:58,199
Lane this is a special name that people

561
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,240
choose and and want to buy and want to

562
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,659
you know spend a lot of money on buying

563
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,919
those seeds uh and chasing this I don't

564
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:10,740
know this z-term you know this it has

565
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,419
it's gonna be you know special that's

566
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,359
got to be really disappointing like for

567
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:19,020
people who like yeah and then they get

568
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,538
it like oh shoot your scraper cool man I

569
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,298
I just talked with one guy who who

570
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:27,000
bought some Riot some right seats I

571
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:30,000
talked with him and he sent me a list of

572
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,900
what he started in the last two years I

573
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,038
think dude the whole list was full of Z

574
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:40,200
and Sharps and Z's and zoo and yeah and

575
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,440
he said everything was crap can you

576
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,720
imagine that nope

577
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,000
everything was crap and I called him

578
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,940
maybe you should try some and let him

579
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,859
know how you like uh this work and he

580
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,919
was very intrigued by it and you know

581
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,959
but it reflects that people here spend a

582
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,259
lot of money on

583
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,140
what they think will sell as either

584
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,538
flour or concentrate or

585
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,940
um just just because of the name and the

586
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:12,960
third profile which is now

587
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,419
sherp and and and Z so I feel like

588
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,100
because the American Market is so remote

589
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,700
even the American Market just alone the

590
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:23,219
American Market is so removed like 99 of

591
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,019
it is so removed from real breeding and

592
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,480
what's going on with rope readers and

593
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:29,759
and real seed making and strain

594
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,278
collecting and the few who hold the cuts

595
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,158
very few people even know about that so

596
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,619
you take that from Americans who kind of

597
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,059
all fall along lines of compounds

598
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,058
breeder of the year you know what I mean

599
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:44,038
who doesn't even make seeds and you

600
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:46,379
translate that to playing telephone with

601
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,819
Europe now Europe's seeing this trying

602
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,340
to figure out what's going on in America

603
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,980
to catch some of that hype thing and

604
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,259
they're seeing like idiots as the first

605
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,298
thing representing America and they glom

606
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:59,099
onto it instantly instead of digging

607
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:01,798
deeper I mean they're they're granted

608
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:06,058
there's you I got lucky with you you dug

609
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:08,519
deeper but it is so rare yeah that was

610
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:10,918
one of one of the one of the things that

611
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:15,058
out very early on

612
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,159
I wanted to see the the both sides of

613
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,839
the metal that's what you guys said of

614
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,940
the over there because for me it was

615
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,339
like looking into the future what what

616
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,679
it will bring here yeah if I see the

617
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:28,439
downside I can because it will happen

618
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,919
here it will the same things will happen

619
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,400
here absolutely and people call me you

620
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,080
know all types of things negative and

621
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,038
this and that and you're just a hater

622
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:42,778
because of you cannot uh find a place

623
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,519
for you in the legal game in the future

624
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:47,819
and that's why you're hating on it and

625
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,740
[ __ ] like that you know yeah

626
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,019
whatever but

627
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,720
that was always a big question for me

628
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:58,139
where's the downside and what What will

629
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,960
what will happen if those guys will I

630
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,778
mean bottleneck the whole gene pool to

631
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,019
just a lot of gelatos and [ __ ]

632
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:08,759
inbreds sometimes yeah yeah and bread

633
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,798
cookies is all we got over there and

634
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,960
people don't you know because you

635
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,900
mentioned breeding and who's a real

636
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,340
breeder good people don't care who's a

637
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
real breeder no they don't that's the

638
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:20,879
other part they care about money it's

639
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,700
just yeah they care about how can I sell

640
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,880
this product because x amount of people

641
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,819
want to now have this problem and how

642
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,620
big your mylars are yeah they are

643
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,259
[ __ ] huge and if you buy the right

644
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,879
seats now you save 90 miles it would

645
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,099
save the planet right yeah we're trying

646
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,620
to save the planet by only using tiny

647
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:42,959
mylars yeah man

648
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,359
um yeah and I see that happening a lot

649
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,360
in this Chase but uh

650
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,519
I think with with all without like with

651
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,839
most of the trends it will only last so

652
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,519
long and and there is a certain group a

653
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:00,720
certain amount of people is a growing

654
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,918
amount of people who are asking for hey

655
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,079
so what about Cam and I heard about this

656
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,020
and that

657
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,359
diesel which Diesel and you know they're

658
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:15,720
asking the right questions

659
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:19,019
that were not asked let's say 15 years

660
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,360
back 15 years ago or so 10 years ago

661
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,819
and and

662
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,879
I think that's that's that's that's the

663
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:29,339
right way and that's where I'm

664
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,919
that's why I will always

665
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,819
kind of gravitate towards absolutely

666
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:40,679
this group and sharing what I can

667
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:43,619
learn from also trying to to to to to

668
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,320
get you know a good idea on the

669
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:49,199
authentic card or the taste of this in

670
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,000
hashiko especially if I can if I can

671
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,140
bring something back and cultivate you

672
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
that was always my my my goal to bring

673
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,179
those seats back and I did that you know

674
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,519
I risked my ass bringing back yeah a

675
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,009
bunch of seeds in my my luggage to

676
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,200
Europe

677
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:07,859
[Music]

678
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,740
and I pop all those beans in

679
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:14,399
with the hope to find something that I

680
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:17,519
can share with my people here absolutely

681
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,399
yeah and and I don't you know looking at

682
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,079
all those breeders and catalogs and

683
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,859
offerings and people that I follow

684
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,418
online I look at it and for me today

685
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,298
it's like

686
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,899
a type of of music that I don't listen

687
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:36,000
to I don't have to look at it it's like

688
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:37,558
it's just you know I look at it like

689
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,079
it's a whole different industry because

690
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,819
like yeah it is they're reselling seed

691
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,859
they're seed resellers so we're kind of

692
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,960
in the same industry but like I don't

693
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:48,599
work with seed resellers I don't buy

694
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,000
from resellers so we don't I just like

695
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:52,699
that's not even my Lane I don't give a

696
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,679
[ __ ] what goes on there like

697
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,778
unfortunately it affects all of the

698
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,320
business because people think that is

699
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:02,700
what we are because of them you know

700
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,319
what I mean but one of the most

701
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,600
important reasons I wanted to do this

702
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,918
show too is because I wanted we have The

703
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,459
Syndicate right we have a breeders

704
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,899
syndicate and slowly people are forming

705
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,480
these small groups around the country

706
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:17,219
but we have breeder Syndicate people in

707
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,140
Europe and you're our rep in Europe with

708
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,058
the breeder Syndicate and Riot and I

709
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,740
want people to know who that is so they

710
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:26,220
can see the face of it and be able to

711
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,740
connect with you right there this guy

712
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,079
yeah I tried to react really quick on on

713
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,919
requests you know um I hope I didn't

714
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:37,079
disappoint any of you guys I even try to

715
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,980
reach out in Spain during those cannabis

716
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,960
was a bit of a disappointment but yeah

717
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,220
those those events like I've always

718
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,740
wanted to go to Spanish because it

719
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,179
sounds like a wild party but like at the

720
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,919
same time it sounds like the events

721
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,580
aren't like it used to be

722
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,440
even yeah it's it's big it became really

723
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,079
big dude it happened with Emerald cup

724
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,058
here we used to put our our

725
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,500
um events we used to have our events

726
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,940
around Emerald cup because that's where

727
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,259
we'd all meet and sell seeds and it was

728
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,600
a big deal and we loved it and we

729
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:10,259
supported it a lot and then it became

730
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,298
corporate and now it's just like yeah I

731
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,798
just talked to Tim Blake today for that

732
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:15,480
runs Emerald cup and he said he wants to

733
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:17,759
do a show so I'm very interested to talk

734
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,159
to him too and be like you know like hey

735
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,798
like what you know this is what we saw

736
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,960
we loved it why did it change you know

737
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,720
that'll be a good question

738
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,360
yeah it's the influx I think the influx

739
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,000
of people just the constant

740
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:36,898
pouring in of people here in Europe

741
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,519
and yeah it's gonna be interesting in

742
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:39,778
the next couple years to see where we

743
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,418
are heading

744
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:45,419
especially with Germany going going

745
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:47,580
legal with cannabis clubs and you know

746
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,559
all that it's going to be interesting

747
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,259
for me too because it's our neighboring

748
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:55,798
country and uh how it's going to impact

749
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:58,558
everything here yeah and that's why I

750
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,440
think of you know I want to I want to

751
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:05,519
share a lot of uh cuts

752
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,100
if because I feel like this is this this

753
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,759
golden time before the [ __ ] thing

754
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:14,278
goes pop and yep goes completely bananas

755
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,079
when it goes when it goes legal yeah I

756
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:17,579
experienced it in your country when I

757
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,778
did my travels to the United States

758
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:24,740
absolutely I I was a card holder in in

759
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:26,640
Cali and in Oregon yeah that's awesome

760
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,339
yeah so

761
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,700
I know how it was before everything went

762
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:34,558
crazy and it was beautiful like to be

763
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,798
honest like prop 215 even though it

764
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,678
wasn't perfect like it was way better

765
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,658
than what we have now so much better and

766
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,840
and it was sad that we saw cannabis

767
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,039
people pushing for prop 64. yeah and and

768
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,298
people were just like it's just

769
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,640
California it doesn't matter it doesn't

770
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:52,500
affect me the [ __ ] it doesn't Cali

771
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,140
effect California affects the world like

772
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,700
what happens yeah

773
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,399
yeah that's what I'm saying like it was

774
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,240
a big deal

775
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,759
for the world

776
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,819
and and you know I always try to share

777
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,720
to try to share my Impressions

778
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,298
um

779
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,179
and also share this this kind of

780
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:16,259
downside of it but people don't want to

781
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:18,360
hear it today and I uh you know I often

782
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:20,220
got me pretty pleased with people

783
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,979
because they don't want to hear it yeah

784
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,200
but I have to understand that this is

785
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,099
how they want to do cannabis in the

786
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,620
future for them yeah

787
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:33,480
so like you know you said earlier you

788
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:35,158
said you felt kind of silly you know for

789
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,200
saying like you know you have to do

790
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,120
something or you know what I mean but

791
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,679
that's like what I thought you know at a

792
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,079
social activism level and that's what it

793
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,919
is like I don't like what I see I can

794
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:49,199
either get mad and do nothing or I can

795
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,840
[ __ ] try to set up a group so we can

796
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,519
push back because that's all we got this

797
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,980
is all we got and if no one's doing it

798
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,359
someone has to and and it seems like

799
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,700
there's a lot of us have a similar

800
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,459
mindset that are slowly forming and

801
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,899
grouping together across the world that

802
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,778
all have the same mindset we don't like

803
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:09,719
what we see we we love we love genetics

804
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:12,000
we love the plants and we see how bad

805
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,219
um and how quickly it's gone from like

806
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,739
having an idea of what we have to just

807
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,358
like [ __ ] like as we pick through

808
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,878
history we're realizing there isn't a

809
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:22,679
single clone that got popular that has

810
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,358
perfect provenance on it with true

811
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,260
stories there's none

812
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:27,259
that's bad

813
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,960
and I think during that time in Vienna

814
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,980
was a contractor for various bigger

815
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:41,039
producers a people uh contacted those

816
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,579
produce those companies and gave them

817
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:48,300
their parts of the library so yeah I got

818
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:50,878
suddenly we had Californian cuts and

819
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,919
stuff like that and I could see how it

820
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,480
grows and how I can cultivate all that

821
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,900
and

822
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,599
um and it changed so quickly that old

823
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,700
stuff disappeared and all the new stuff

824
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,039
came in and nobody asked for the old

825
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:07,039
stuff anymore and you know we don't want

826
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,779
to sound like dinosaurs

827
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,539
yeah so I'm like an old [ __ ] stubborn

828
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,640
guy who met now I don't know allow you

829
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:17,460
to stop I don't want that that's not

830
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,739
what it is no no not at all

831
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,199
um I've I've you know like when cookies

832
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:24,539
popped up and you know and I got a hold

833
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,118
of it and two at the end of 2010 early

834
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:30,239
2011. it may mean it might have been

835
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,740
late 2011. something like that but when

836
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,358
we released the seed line like we were

837
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,799
trying to do unique [ __ ] with it it was

838
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,259
cool because no one had done anything

839
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,640
with cookies yet so I was thinking wow I

840
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,880
could do some unique stuff with this

841
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,799
unique looking plant and nowadays I

842
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,660
regret ever touching it because like it

843
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,060
contributed to the whole decline of the

844
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:49,799
gene porn and I just didn't know back

845
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,119
then that everybody was going to do what

846
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,820
I just did

847
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,920
you know like I had no clue man it was

848
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,140
it wasn't I mean it was good for all of

849
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,039
us I also was one of the first guys who

850
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:05,039
got who cultivated the uh a cookie

851
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,960
cookie hybrid here yeah because I came

852
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,480
back from a journey on the west coast

853
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,820
trying all types of cookie crosses and I

854
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,740
was like okay I Now understand why it's

855
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,599
popular and I'll try to bring it back

856
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,000
and sure I would have also played my

857
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,180
rolling in introducing a lot of people

858
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,539
to to this particular to this particular

859
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,219
plant that changed even it changed [ __ ]

860
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:27,119
here you know yeah it changed it

861
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,578
everywhere

862
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,858
because the bag appeal started and

863
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,560
beautiful plans on Instagram started a

864
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:36,420
lot and attracted Instagram

865
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,039
to me changed the way people breed

866
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,980
because like

867
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:43,259
before with Instagram before Instagram

868
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,179
you would have to be on forums to see

869
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,260
people's inside their grows for the most

870
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,519
part you'd have to be in that little

871
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,980
Forum Community a lot of people didn't

872
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,139
join those or weren't a part of it and

873
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,480
then you have the new wave of people on

874
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:56,338
Instagram and Instagram everything is

875
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,838
very visual everything's got to be

876
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:00,358
beautiful that you see if you see a

877
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,400
plant that's old and doesn't have a lot

878
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:03,900
of resin it's not going to get a lot of

879
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,338
play like that's that's not easy to

880
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,780
Market like why would I smoke that when

881
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:08,279
I could smoke this philosophy thing over

882
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,980
here because people don't understand

883
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,359
what resin glands are and the oils they

884
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,820
contain and all that stuff so they don't

885
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,279
understand visually that you can't judge

886
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,019
a plant visually like that but if

887
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,740
cookies are so Frosty and so beautiful

888
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:24,659
that the Instagram generation it just

889
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:27,239
never changed after that everything has

890
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,460
to be that level of resin or it's not

891
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,199
acceptable and because that's what their

892
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,760
mindset is and extractors and everything

893
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,500
else that's their mindset and they don't

894
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,500
get it they just don't get it

895
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:44,639
a hybrid out of the bubonic line yeah

896
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,079
and they're like wait a minute okay so

897
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,739
uh

898
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,019
damn yeah you know connect with the blue

899
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,179
bonnet it's been very hard to resell

900
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,639
blueberry right because blue there's

901
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:58,078
been DJ shorts blueberry for

902
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,838
decades

903
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,660
and you know many people have spent good

904
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,940
money on his blueberries and maybe they

905
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:07,319
were happy maybe they weren't most

906
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,000
likely you know like if they were

907
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,740
looking for a true blueberry smelling

908
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,358
plant that tastes like blueberry they

909
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,819
probably weren't super stoked because

910
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,000
it's it's not that

911
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,079
[Music]

912
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,780
um

913
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,460
but I mean it's in there it would just

914
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,680
take a lot of popping it but they were

915
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,740
so expensive prohibitively expensive to

916
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,259
buy you know tons of packs of

917
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,598
trying so a lot of people tried it spent

918
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,339
the money and decided in their mind I've

919
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,859
tried blueberry I know it's like I don't

920
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:37,139
like it it doesn't get me that high you

921
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,838
know didn't really taste that blue so

922
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,480
coming along later and then saying no

923
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,159
I have blueberry it tastes and smells

924
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,579
like blueberry

925
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,899
it's people are like yeah right

926
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:50,760
I've already spent money on them why am

927
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,338
I going to try again so it's been a hard

928
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,160
sell it's been a very freaking Hard Sell

929
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:58,858
but I know it's so special and so unique

930
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,779
to bring this back that I'm stubborn on

931
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:03,480
it like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fold

932
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,060
on it you know exactly exactly but it's

933
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,039
warm enough I think one of the one of

934
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:11,460
the the

935
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:15,358
one of the strains of flavors there was

936
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,940
over all those years the most requests I

937
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,578
got or questions say can you get a real

938
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,579
blueberry yeah like I mean a real

939
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:26,339
blueberry blurry like real blueberry or

940
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:30,599
chemical blueberry flavors yeah

941
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:33,779
and and I remember uh I bought a couple

942
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,660
packs of Schwartz blueberry and I only

943
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,359
found Woody kind of Booth tasting

944
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,338
beautiful looking but it was beautiful

945
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,759
but yeah it was not it's not it was not

946
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:47,519
good but nobody would came back and ask

947
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,560
for more I'll respect the DJ but you

948
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,480
don't see each other of his Cuts

949
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,699
floating around like you have his his

950
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,079
selected cut of 98 blueberry and that's

951
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,460
what most people use when they breed

952
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,280
blueberry and that's it like his cat

953
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,179
yeah and I mean I know I know at least

954
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:06,240
10 guys out there who spent between 200

955
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:08,578
and 1500 Euros on on blueberry season

956
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,039
never found [ __ ] I mean are they all

957
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,140
idiots I don't know I don't think so but

958
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,338
I don't think so I mean I did the same I

959
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,598
did the same and why wouldn't you know

960
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,420
like because that's the guy who made

961
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,519
blueberry and uh so that's why I was

962
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,420
intrigued when you you know explained

963
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,659
everything

964
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,338
and told me the whole thing about uh

965
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:30,779
about

966
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:32,519
the blue bonnet yeah and I said dude uh

967
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,019
talked with a couple people here and

968
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,780
kind of try to

969
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:39,599
get a feel on is there any anybody

970
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,519
interested in a bunch of paperwork

971
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,559
because they were fed up with gelato

972
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,858
flavors and oh I bet

973
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:50,039
and wanted something relevant or the

974
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:52,619
real throwback yeah or more uh improved

975
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:57,659
kind of throwback you know yeah

and also also potent not only tasting

977
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,659
like that because I mean there's a lot

978
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,578
of tasty stuff out there there's no

979
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,319

982
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,599
now this this is special and

983
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,279
um you know like I I was hard to figure

984
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,440
out what would sell in Europe right

985
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,660
because we have over here pretty sour

986
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,260

we were working on in a cloud he was

1036
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,900
working with CSI on the glue 1000 which

1037

Bonnet and when he passed that was the

1040
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,858
plan was to release it together and

1041
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,740
because he didn't we didn't I'm just

1042
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:46,440
mostly giving as many out for free as I

1043
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:50,159
can because like it's a fire ass line

1044
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,019
it's beautiful and it's it's something

1045
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,059
special with me and Joe you know yeah

1046
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:56,599
she looks beautiful I posted the

1047
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:59,639
pictures on the yeah

1048
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:02,338
and I don't know why I didn't pick her

1049
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,618
but that would be the tools are the ones

1050
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:06,838
because of certain reasons people are

1051
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,539
curious and I I can't tell you guys I

1052
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,880
mean if you are talking about the price

1053
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,940
only because that was often the main

1054
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,240
question yeah it is a steer for what you

1055
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,460
get and I'm not exaggerating okay I

1056
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,358
would never say that if it wasn't like

1057
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,460
this so so if you ever if you ever want

1058
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:29,880
to pick one of those or a couple

1059
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,920
the price is always amazing and and I

1060
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,740
mean what you get for that is something

1061
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,139
that some of those huge [ __ ] Myla

1062
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:39,118
guys can't offer and will never be able

1063
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,460
to yeah you think they can but they

1064
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,200
can't you know they can't the best they

1065
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,000
can do is I've done and what Lone Star

1066
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,919
did but they don't know how to do that

1067
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,300
they don't that's a lot there's no way

1068
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,980
they don't even know what the traits are

1069
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,060
to breed for you know what I mean and

1070
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,500
that's that's what it takes when you

1071
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:55,139
work blueberries knowing the trades to

1072
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,780
breed food yeah so I mean they might be

1073
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:59,159
able to S1 one of my things and change

1074
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,240
the name but everybody's gonna know what

1075
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,338

wallet yeah yeah yeah if you're in

1121
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,838
Europe and you want to get a hold of my

1122
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,480

00:46:55,858 --> 00:47:01,259
yeah no really not a big deal for us and

1126
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,539
we want to do that it's

1127
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,880
um I think with with looking at the

1128
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:07,679
seeds that are offered we have to do

1129
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,800
this you know that's why I stepped in

1130
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:13,318
with you and and decided to do this I'd

1131
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,720
like to eventually get out like the

1132
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:18,239
whole syndicates group stuff out there

1133
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:19,858
like high-end lonesomes you know all

1134
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,239
that stuff eventually get it out there

1135
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:22,920
so everybody can get everything in

1136
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,659
Europe from from people that are vetted

1137
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,139
by our operator Syndicate Crooks that's

1138
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:30,000
the thing like people see like

1139
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:32,098
I don't even consider what I have on my

1140
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,599
site a seed bank at all because I never

1141
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,380
wanted to run a seed bank it has nothing

1142
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,119
to do with that all it is is our group

1143
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,318
of friends and the only reason people

1144
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,420
have made it into our group of friends

1145
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,960
is because we [ __ ] have vetted each

1146
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,480
other super [ __ ] heavy and it's built

1147
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,179
up over years and these are guys that I

1148
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,659
would put my own reputation behind like

1149
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:56,818
I don't do that with people I don't know

1150
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:58,739
as real as you can get I mean if I look

1151

at the list now I'm British indicate all

1152
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:05,519
the guys who contribute to

1153
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,440
I mean that's some amazing stuff if uh

1154
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,099
yeah just you have to look at it go to

1155

00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:15,960
and CSI

1158
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,059
um we just talked about it yesterday and

1159
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,119
we're going to do um some diesel Femme

1160
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:24,779
projects Tunes uh so yeah yeah so

1161
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:27,000
bringing diesel back the s1s the hybrids

1162
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,700
and a lot of hybrids I've never made so

1163
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,679
I'm really stoked to see giesel hit like

1164
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:36,960
I don't know TK I I will reversed

1165
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,899
we did the diesel TK what is he what is

1166
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,318
in there G diesel cam one will be

1167
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,318
interesting diesel

1168
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,639
um he did the diesel cam 91 and I

1169
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,318
haven't run that yet with I think he

1170
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,338
reversed the chem 91 onto the diesel but

1171
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,039
we're going to reverse the G's along to

1172
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:56,818
the cam 91 but those are [ __ ]

1173
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:59,539
phenomenal like diesel Oracle oh yeah

1174
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,800
diesel Urkel I've never done that like

1175
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:02,699
there's so much to do and it's like it's

1176
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,380
a

1177
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:06,899
perfect Super Skunk everybody wants

1178
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,599
super skunk and even in Europe everybody

1179
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,599
wants old skunky stuff right and it's

1180
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,460
there yeah

1181
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,500
expectation I think is different and I

1182
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,440
think people will be surprised if the

1183
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:22,199
trial is here diesel today diesel was

1184
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,300
available in Vienna long time ago oh

1185
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,460
really I remember it looks exactly like

1186
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,619
your diesel yeah

1187
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:33,900
and I remember being super potent skunky

1188
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:35,640
very very heavy smoke yeah it's good

1189
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,380
[ __ ] it's really good it's my favorite

1190
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,420
of the chems and diesels all of them

1191
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,358
combined it would be my favorite even

1192
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,099
over sour and it's frustrating because

1193
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:45,960
it doesn't have a good name I think

1194
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:47,460
that's why it didn't sell jesel is just

1195
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,980
kind of like what's that like not diesel

1196
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,159
it's not cam you know but it's it's

1197
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,719
super skunk and it had they called it it

1198
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:57,779
would have sold but they called it

1199
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,459
diesel so it just never caught up I'm

1200
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,319
telling you it's crazy it drives me nuts

1201
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,720
because it's probably the skunkiest

1202
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:05,400
thing left that's inherently skunky that

1203
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,759
you can breed with and just people just

1204
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,880
like eh diesel what are you gonna do

1205
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,500
but I think I can communicate it here in

1206
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,780
a in a right kind of the right fashion

1207
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:21,358
to to make it really interesting because

1208
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,819
people know I mean people know super

1209
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,519
skunk here yeah

1210
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:29,159
I think they would be surprised what

1211
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:33,719
kind of what kind of profile they would

1212
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:36,059
find and what what it will show them in

1213
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:39,059
regards to the new stuff that is around

1214
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:39,059
uh

1215
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,318
it's different than European Super Skunk

1216
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,079
that's still around because European

1217
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:48,659
Super Skunk looks super skunky it tends

1218
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,059
to be pretty sweet and this is a very

1219
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:53,039
early 90s first year Super Skunk type

1220
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,780
and it's like I think it would blow

1221
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,058
their minds it seriously blew their

1222
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,640
minds to be a blast in the past but like

1223
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:01,859
I said it's even in America with people

1224
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:04,318
everyone wanting skunk because it's

1225
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,619
called jesel like very few get it no

1226
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:09,420
matter if I could stomp scream

1227
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,220
spit it don't matter people ain't gonna

1228
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,180
listen

1229
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:15,058
I hope that they figure it out

1230
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:18,000
eventually I don't know yeah we will

1231
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:23,460
continue to to talk about it and also I

1232
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,500
think diesel will uh blue bonnet will be

1233
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,659
one of the the next elections that I

1234
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,300
want to do it's special there's and

1235
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:32,519
again she's a blue bonnet because it's

1236
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:35,339
super skunk it there there's booth in

1237
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,960
there there is but there is a straight

1238
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:38,818
fire in there too

1239
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,338
um we did a one called triangle choke

1240
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:43,380
that's a jesel it was the diesel I'm

1241
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:46,078
sorry triangle Kush reverse diesel

1242
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,880
across the blue bonnet and

1243
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,619
that in there is some of the most

1244
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,200
resinous stuff it looks like it could be

1245
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:55,680
a [ __ ] wedding cake type plant but it

1246
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:57,299
is so blueberry jam just insane we have

1247
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,239
an insane cut going around right now

1248
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,099
over here that is just fire and it has

1249
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,379
all it ticks all the boxes for the looks

1250
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:06,900
for the Instagram kids which still is

1251
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,880
just absolute fire and whereas

1252
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,220
it doesn't have the skunky notes it's

1253
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,000
all blueberry jam in that one which is

1254
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:14,098
crazy

1255
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,260
yeah I can't wait for Harsh uh

1256
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:18,539
hashmakers in Europe also to try some of

1257
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,579
it yeah some of those crosses because

1258
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:24,800
people ask me some other crosses the

1259
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:28,260
blue bonnet crosses tend to or uh

1260
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,440
are specifically bred by Matthew to

1261
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:34,200
improve let's say the GMO yeah and it's

1262
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,139
not to give the GMO a blue bonnet taste

1263
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:40,019
it's to improve the GMO and and that's

1264
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:42,598
that's an amazing amazing opportunity

1265
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:45,179
for guys out there to uh to get a GMO

1266
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,980
line that is shock and flower and

1267
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:51,539
improved in some of the aspects of the

1268
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:53,338
the GMO maybe it's kind of like a GMO to

1269
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:55,079
me is a great plant but the biggest

1270
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:56,940
problem is that like it's hard for a lot

1271
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,619
of people to cash crop because it's

1272
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,079
longer flowering to get it super dank

1273
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:03,059
but the Bonnet is so fast that it

1274
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,800
decreases the time and it's a very like

1275
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:06,839
when people think about blueberries some

1276
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,579
of them have this blueberry sativa type

1277
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:10,318
thing in their head and this is a

1278
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:14,160
blueberry Afghan type plant it's very

1279
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:16,619
cushy and and very frosty and very dense

1280
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:19,379
so it keeps the density and the

1281
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,880
Beautiful frostiness of GMO but it

1282
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,260
shortens the flower time dramatically

1283
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,640
and I think that's what most people are

1284
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,280
looking for with you but they want to

1285
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,779
keep those chirps but have the flowering

1286
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,900
time dramatically

1287
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,880
you know reduced

1288
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,519
which which one would you recommend for

1289
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:39,240
outdoors I mean for let's say a central

1290
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,559
European Auto this is a sentence what's

1291
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,939
over there right now I mean like it

1292
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,619
doesn't matter because I would I would

1293
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,740
probably recommend bubbleberry over

1294
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:49,019
there that's the shortest for outdoor

1295
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:51,118
season and because of the moisture it

1296
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:52,619
can handle moisture without molding and

1297
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,380
that's so [ __ ] important you know for

1298
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:57,119
Central Europe and all those places

1299
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,338
yeah that's what I recommended because

1300
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,480
some of the guys asked you hey what do

1301
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:02,818
you what would you recommend for

1302
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,699
yourself through European Auto kind of

1303
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:07,558
set up in a garden or a glass house or a

1304
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:09,838
hoop house and I always thought the

1305
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,480
bubbleberry would be probably the best

1306
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,818
choice bubbleberry blistering also does

1307
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,358
well this one does real well outdoors

1308
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:20,880
and and can handle the the uh the mold

1309
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:23,279
because the blue bonnet

1310
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,019
um what else is really good outdoor the

1311
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,300
Cherry berries really good outdoor with

1312
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:29,699
AK-47

1313
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,260
um trademark Chad super good Outdoors

1314
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,379
we've seen a lot of that done outdoors

1315
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,480
in California

1316
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:38,400
because of her

1317
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,740
kind of she has a long tradition in

1318
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,660
Central Europe I mean people do a lot of

1319
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:43,919
turbine poisoning yeah that's why I

1320
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:46,739
chose her yeah

1321
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,480
yeah I think that I think that um

1322
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:50,578
was one of the ones that I I was like

1323
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,039
well Durbin's Ultra paneling it's all

1324
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:55,079
witch hazel so maybe maybe people won't

1325
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,300
buy it but I think it'll make a cool

1326
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,280
cross and it turned out like you can

1327
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,380
find like

1328
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,420
not quite skunky but like garbagey

1329
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,099
smelling stuff in it too like the the

1330
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,260
way it crossed didn't just turn out

1331
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:09,359
blueberry terpening there's wild stuff

1332
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,160
in there that you would never expect and

1333
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,558
it is super resinous I mean it's just

1334
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,598
yeah it ticked all the boxes too

1335
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,440
and that's that's one of the reasons why

1336
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,480
I like

1337
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,338
I'm usually one of those guys who would

1338
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,079
like I I work on something for a while

1339
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:23,880
and then I move on to the next because I

1340
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,500
have bad ADHD and I want to do something

1341
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,539
new I always want to do something new

1342
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,300
and do what's next I haven't moved on

1343
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:33,119
from the bonnetwork because

1344
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,800
it's like when you find a male that is

1345
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,260
that predictably predictable for

1346
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,660
breeding danks you never want to move on

1347
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,579
because that's rare that is so rare to

1348
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,618
have a male that you can predict how he

1349
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,960
will always breed with everything that's

1350
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:48,780
the ultimate tool so it's like why move

1351
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,699
on when I found the best thing that I've

1352
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,980
ever bred with you know what I mean but

1353
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:56,219
yeah what's your your reaction now

1354
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:59,159
remember your reaction back then and

1355
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:01,439
I could I could tell her okay this guy

1356
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:05,879
found something that checks all the

1357
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,760
boxes and is so predictable and it also

1358
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,119
showed me the the breeding goals because

1359
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,500
I I tend to attempt to not find them and

1360
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,599
most of the guys out there where's your

1361
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,940
[ __ ] breeding board what are you what

1362
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,220
what are you even

1363
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,920
what are you trying to accomplish poly

1364
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:25,379
hybrid times polyhybrids or what I mean

1365
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,599
and that I was all that's you know

1366
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,760
intriguing

1367
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,680
yeah I think I think that's not even a

1368
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,260
common mindset when it should be in seed

1369
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,679
making is what am I trying to achieve I

1370
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,140
have an idea I would like a strawberry

1371
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,838
plant a plant that has strawberry Terps

1372
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:43,618
that maybe grows like

1373
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:46,739
um

1374
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:49,200
uh you know uh just whatever and then

1375
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:52,019
you you then you go from there think

1376
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:54,118
what plants what material do I have that

1377
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:56,338
can achieve this goal what can achieve

1378
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,380
closest what do I think and I can take a

1379
00:56:56,338 --> 00:57:00,179
few Generations in and make work it that

1380
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,858
way but most people are like I want to

1381
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:04,980
see what happens if you cross this to

1382
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:06,539
this man that's cool man no like that's

1383
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,119
that's what most seed makers do what

1384
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:11,759
happens when you cross this stuff oh man

1385
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,960
that's not that's neat you know and I'm

1386
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,059
like I'm I'm thinking I if I cross this

1387
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,159
to this and it doesn't achieve my goal I

1388
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,300
have failed and I don't want to release

1389
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:25,980
it you know that's why I think yeah

1390
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,920
it's a bit with the same bits running

1391
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:32,099
small selections that I do here yeah uh

1392
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:35,159
but I don't find anything good I will

1393
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:38,099
probably never offer it or never ask

1394
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:41,279
people who I know her there's a cup this

1395
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:43,619
is something that I found yeah but uh

1396
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,319
what what I wanted to ask you

1397
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:48,780
if I can so

1398
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:52,440
is there something that you were

1399
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,780
thinking about working on uh in in

1400
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,400
regards to a new a new cross to totally

1401
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,640
new thing is this something that would

1402
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,680
where you would say

1403
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:04,078
man somehow can't even explain like

1404
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,598
beautiful art I can't explain why I like

1405
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,079
it but I would love to have it or do it

1406
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:13,079
or make it or whatever so there's a line

1407
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:17,539
uh from Switzerland called perforated

1408
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:19,619
condenses or sorry Purple Rain yeah

1409
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:21,019
or something like that some weird way

1410
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:24,380
they pronounce it

1411
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:27,539
it's from Felix at all seeds

1412
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:31,440
and it's an ornamental plant it really

1413
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:33,599
holds not much THC value and it probably

1414
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,059
isn't even that good but

1415
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,818
it's a it's it's what I call a base

1416
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,260
purple line where it's a line that has

1417
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:42,960
been in someone's Garden for a long time

1418
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:45,720
that's naturally purple That's Heavy

1419
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,940
purple and that breeds true for purples

1420
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:50,818
that hasn't really been injected into

1421
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,960
the Cannabis pool much like it's

1422
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:54,480
something that stayed out of the

1423
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,679
Cannabis pool like we have herb pert and

1424
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,019
we have

1425
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:00,019
we have yeah that's it

1426
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:10,920
yeah which is also a purple Swiss uh

1427
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:13,559
Indica I think it's a referred to as a

1428
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,180
as a pre-soviet indica or something like

1429
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:18,298
that yeah that's one of those things

1430
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:19,919
where it's like in in cannabis is for

1431
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:21,900
some reason people decided that when the

1432
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,298
Soviets invaded that afghanis got bad

1433
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,380
but I you know like I see that all the

1434
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:31,500
time like I got a pre-soviet Afghan bro

1435
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:33,119
[ __ ] you to me as if the guy Somewhere

1436
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,119
In The Valleys that couldn't keep their

1437
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,200
seats

1438
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,079
Soviets came and took all their [ __ ]

1439
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:42,480
yeah

1440
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:44,280
they tried like like the The Afghani

1441
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,900
government is trying now but there's no

1442
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,900
[ __ ] way to do it now

1443
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,420
nobody's really asked me that but I

1444
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:58,940
think like the first thing that comes to

1445
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,838
mind is

1446
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:03,539
just because it's something I haven't

1447
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:06,058
touched and then another one I'd like to

1448
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:08,579
go back and work that I have worked with

1449
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:10,740
and um Dutch Passion sent me the mother

1450
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:13,079
seeds for and they got lost in the mail

1451
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:16,639
they never made it it killed me is is

1452
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,640
purple number one in purple star

1453
01:00:18,858 --> 01:00:27,298
it's an old purple Afghani and it's a

1454
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:30,539
very old purple Afghani and it's it's in

1455
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:31,980
a lot of Old Dutch stuff and I don't

1456
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:34,019
know it just fascinates me I've used it

1457
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,880
it's not that great but for some reason

1458
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:36,900
I want to go back to it and it's just

1459
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,059
one of those things where it's like

1460
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,980
there's no Rhyme or Reason that these

1461
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:43,019
two base purples because I've always

1462
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,699
been like more than anything I've been

1463
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:47,039
to purple Chaser my whole life for

1464
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:51,239
campus I love the color purple whether

1465
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,779
it's my shirts or headphones or I don't

1466
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:58,139
know I kind of recognized it yeah

1467
01:00:53,780 --> 01:01:01,859
everything's purple so you know uh

1468
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:03,659
I I am I gravitate towards beautiful

1469
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:05,279
Aesthetics in the garden like that's

1470
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:07,078
important to me to go in there and see

1471
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,798
beauty and purple's part of beauty to me

1472
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:12,420
for some whatever reason yeah my hooky

1473
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:16,440
up with purple number one if you want

1474
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:18,358
some I said I do I do I like I have I

1475
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,039
have old purple number one regular seeds

1476
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:22,159
but I doubt they'd pop anymore they're

1477
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:25,798
so old

1478
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:27,779
yeah this this is sold yeah yeah Dutch

1479
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:30,059
fashion still sells them yeah they're

1480
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:33,180
assault in Vienna I think I I worked at

1481
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:36,480
a shop at a grocery shop for time also

1482
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:40,039
yeah and I had to have a job it was yeah

1483
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,039
yeah it's struggle times yeah

1484
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:47,639
them being in the fridge purple number

1485
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:49,140
one yeah it's it's uh it's not even that

1486
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,480
good of a strain but something about it

1487
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:53,759
like

1488
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,818
the way its Terps are very weird and

1489
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,839
unique and I think I think I could do

1490
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:59,000
something cool with it it's almost like

1491
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,199
a

1492
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,358
plasticky vinyl

1493
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,259
table

1494
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:05,739
with milk

1495
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:09,730
it's weird but

1496
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:09,729
[Laughter]

1497
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:15,539
like

1498
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:18,139
a fresh new couch vinyl

1499
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:18,139
hmm

1500
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:21,179
or maybe opening a brand new record and

1501
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:23,460
smelling it

1502
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:25,500
I don't know it's it's just a smell but

1503
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:27,960
it's it's to me it's a pleasant smell

1504
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:33,599
like not sour milk but just like fresh

1505
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:35,159
milk and by it's weird but purple I've

1506
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,180
never smelled I have no idea what those

1507
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:42,719
chirps are like on that plant

1508
01:02:38,179 --> 01:02:46,259
the ones that I remember and billion

1509
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:47,219
advert yeah they were quite similar they

1510
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,180
had

1511
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:53,578
um a wild berry taste to them like if

1512
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:55,019
you if you buy if you know Wildberry

1513
01:02:53,579 --> 01:03:00,079
High reports

1514
01:02:55,019 --> 01:03:00,079
now you ever had I send you a package

1515
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:07,559
they taste like

1516
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:10,260
um like concord grapes and berries

1517
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:12,720
you know this kind of overripe uh Berry

1518
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:17,339
taste or a great taste

1519
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:18,679
a mixture of of this kind of uh a Musky

1520
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:22,318
grape

1521
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:24,659
I like that and that's I would so people

1522
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:27,058
people would I think some people today

1523
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:29,159
would say it will be taste purple yeah

1524
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:30,900
yeah probably heavy in anthocyanins and

1525
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:33,000
that's what they're and there's not a

1526
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,818
taste to it like for anthocyanins or

1527
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,559
smell but there is something that people

1528
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:40,858
inherently smell this smells purple this

1529
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:43,380
tastes purple yeah and and Hashi I

1530
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:46,318
remember them being very hash in the in

1531
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:50,099
the taste profile and

1532
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:52,679
um yeah very very afghani-like yeah it's

1533
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:54,660
a very early Afghani so I want to chase

1534
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:57,838
it it's not like I'm chasing a skunky

1535
01:03:54,659 --> 01:04:00,420
Afghani in this case like chasing an

1536
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:03,480
Afghani that is pretty pure and

1537
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:05,099
untouched old world my problem is a lot

1538
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:09,019
of the afghanis now

1539
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:13,200
and a lot of the Moroccans and Lebanese

1540
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:16,619
during the the mid to late 90s and early

1541
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:20,159
2000s DNA in those groups went down

1542
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:21,838
there and you know flooded that area

1543
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,639
with their seeds sold seeds to all the

1544
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,619
farmers and now like people are all

1545
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,598
excited that the they're collecting land

1546
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:28,920
races from Afghanistan from these groups

1547
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,880
and a lot of them like you see them

1548
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,099
they're

1549
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,500
pink and purple like then you what the

1550
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:36,780
[ __ ] you think this is like you know I

1551
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,239
mean there's very few purple Afghanistan

1552
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:42,380
like pink magenta afghanis that we know

1553
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:44,759
of like there's or Pakis there's trolley

1554
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:46,260
into trolley

1555
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,760
and like

1556
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,400
purple number one

1557
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,619
so it's possible but a lot of these we

1558
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,720
know were infected with uh modern

1559
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:57,420
genetics and that's what's mostly down

1560
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:59,039
there now and it's it's catastrophic but

1561
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:01,019
it is catastrophic and and it's more

1562
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,838
catastrophic because we have land race

1563
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:05,880
collectors now that are experts online

1564
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:07,858
that are only collecting this stuff

1565
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,720
because they only got in during this era

1566
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:11,699
and don't have stuff from before that

1567
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:13,199
and now they're breeding with it calling

1568
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,460
it land races and starting a whole new

1569
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,139
community of people that think this is

1570
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:19,139
all land races because they haven't done

1571
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:21,058
the research and it drives me nuts it's

1572
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:22,500
like blind leading the blind leading the

1573
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:24,720
blind and I know they have good

1574
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,920
intentions they have good intentions you

1575
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,480
know I know they do and they're probably

1576
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,818
passionate people about genetics and

1577
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,500
it's like trying to explain to them that

1578
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:35,338
they probably don't have access to the

1579
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:38,039
stuff anymore is like too much for them

1580
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:41,099
they they no of course we do I have it I

1581
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:43,400
paid money oh yeah yeah you paid money

1582
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:46,079
exactly I paid money for it this is real

1583
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,818
it turns it into reality if you pay

1584
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,400
enough money just throw enough money on

1585
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:52,079
it yeah now yeah it makes them

1586
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,880
emotionally invested in it is what it

1587
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,000
does yeah I can recommend to people to

1588
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:59,099
look at what's his name

1589
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,838
yeah yeah and look at his account and

1590
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:04,380
then you will see the real Afghanistan

1591
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:06,960
the real Balochistan and how the players

1592
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:09,660
look there and yeah what they what those

1593
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,358
farmers do yeah um there's been some

1594
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:14,818
great videos there um there's a land

1595
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:16,440
race selections I think it is he was

1596
01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:17,460
going to do a view through like go

1597
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,740
through the fields as they were

1598
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:22,440
collecting and stuff but

1599
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:24,298
um yeah like my experience with a lot of

1600
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,039
land race afghanis isn't what people

1601
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:28,679
think of as like

1602
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,500
dense cushes that are super Frosty like

1603
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:33,598
it's usually Airy hermaphroditic

1604
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,579
like shorter squatter plots but some of

1605
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,920
them go like [ __ ] 12 weeks you know

1606
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,798
in the field and get real tall in these

1607
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:44,818
Afghanistan production for flow yeah

1608
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:49,280
exactly only only women and and peasants

1609
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:53,519
were uh small yes smoke flowers yeah

1610
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:57,380
we've been in slaves yeah damn they

1611
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,380
still talking slaves in Afghanistan

1612
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:03,359
no but but they look beautiful and uh I

1613
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:05,338
mean it's a look into the the past when

1614
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,719
it's like looking at a dinosaur for me

1615
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:08,279
yeah

1616
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:09,058
and I want to get them before they're

1617
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,099
gone

1618
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:13,140
because no one's collecting for Berea

1619
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:16,740
did you need your [ __ ]

1620
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:18,598
number one for for preservation no one's

1621
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:19,919
looking at them for that and I don't

1622
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,500
want them to be gone

1623
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,619
during my time at a big production

1624
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:30,838
company in Vienna I cultivated

1625
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:30,838
um the the pooper one of the Genesis

1626
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:38,159
um Alpine rocket and I remember that and

1627
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:42,358
what was um

1628
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:44,519
one more or two more Swiss genetics that

1629
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,719
we got from from the guys who cultivated

1630
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,719
them in high elevation

1631
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:53,879
hybrids from hell

1632
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,839
I think hybrids from hell and other

1633
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:00,059
people in this kind of circle yeah

1634
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:01,920
from the mountains there I I almost

1635
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:04,140
forgot esbin and I should say this

1636
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,599
because he's done more work with artpart

1637
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:09,719
and purpuree and stuff that I totally

1638
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:12,480
spaced but he's a legit [ __ ] dude

1639
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:14,159
hybrids from hell if if people are

1640
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,380
interested in what I'm talking about and

1641
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:18,599
you could have access to get these

1642
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:20,159
shipped in hybrids from Hell he's a

1643
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,900
great dude he's been around forever and

1644
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:22,738
he has great Swiss genetics so check him

1645
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:26,759
out too

1646
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:29,358
yeah you often uh talked about Mephisto

1647
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:33,719
genetics because people ask a lot

1648
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:35,940
for hey do you recommend is there any

1649
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:37,920
artist that you would recommend yeah

1650
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:40,678
yeah and I think you talked about

1651
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:44,279
Memphis to a couple times in very good

1652
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:46,020
uh that that's legit stuff and yeah yeah

1653
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,719
he seems to be doing decent work with it

1654
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:52,500
real decent work with autos and like

1655
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:54,480
I'm not a big Auto person myself I was

1656
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,179
one of the first Americans to like bring

1657
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:02,099
Autos over make feminized autos and sell

1658
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:05,640
them like it was like 2007 but

1659
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:08,120
I didn't I don't Maybe I'm Wrong Maybe

1660
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,119
I'm Wrong

1661
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:16,019
I don't find a way to make Autos that

1662
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,419
I'm happy with if that makes sense I

1663
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,640
think that there's a place for Autos

1664
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,779
when it comes to breeding because I

1665
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,338
think

1666
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:25,739
um young breeders that want to learn how

1667
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:27,179
to breed for traits the auto flowers are

1668
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:28,919
one of the best ways to do it especially

1669
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:31,079
if you get like Autoflower doors from

1670
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,239
Buddha seeds in Spain not big Buddha

1671
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:35,579
seeds Buddha seeds in Spain rest in

1672
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:37,678
peace big Buddha yeah rest in peace Milo

1673
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:40,140
yeah for sure

1674
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,899
um but Buddha seeds Spain they have

1675
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:45,600
dwarf Autos that finish in 60 days from

1676
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:46,979
seed and that way you can if you if

1677
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,420
you're breeding for traits it's a great

1678
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:50,879
way to learn how to breed for traits

1679
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,338
very fast and very fast generations and

1680
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,020
that's about the most I got for Autos is

1681
01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:56,279
is they're great for breeding and

1682
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,860
learning breeding

1683
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:59,880
yeah people here ask for it and I try to

1684
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:03,299
explain them

1685
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,460
why do you take an order that needs more

1686
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:07,560
light and takes longer makes more

1687
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:10,380
[ __ ] sense yeah yeah like normal

1688
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,300
normal Autos that take 110 days or 90

1689
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,640
days it's like what's the [ __ ] point

1690
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:17,880
20 hours live yeah I think it's

1691
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,500
appealing to people because like they

1692
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,460
don't understand the light stuff the

1693
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,460
light part of it you know

1694
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,960
and that's why I say we if you if you

1695
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,960
choose routes it's it's all regular

1696
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:33,960
seeds yes often tell the people they ask

1697
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:37,079
me a lot they are they feminist you have

1698
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,520
any of the blue bonnet feminized they're

1699
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:41,340
all regular seats

1700
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,900
for now yeah we will do some blue bonnet

1701
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,880
fans eventually

1702
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:47,099
um yeah it's hard because my reputation

1703
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,779
is feminized seeds too and making the

1704
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,820
spray the fence spray so everybody just

1705
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:53,579
assumes my stuff's feminized but I I

1706
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:55,319
like I prefer regular breeding I

1707
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:56,640
actually

1708
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:58,380
um wish more people would do regular

1709
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,719
breeding because it's an art selecting

1710
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,279
males and you learn so much that way and

1711
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,500
but there's nothing against them I love

1712
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:06,300
them and I've learned it's just a

1713
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,500
different tool to me it's just a whole

1714
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,679
different tool set to learn different

1715
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,719
ways but yeah I I love regular breeding

1716
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,300
and I love selecting males and usually

1717
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,920
like you know people ask me what trait I

1718
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,420
look for in males in breeding it's

1719
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:22,560
usually they're butt cheeks

1720
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:24,600
um I like some males yeah totally you

1721
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,460
should look for that and maybe smelly

1722
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,100
butt cheeks yeah smelly butt cheeks

1723
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:31,739
sweaty eat it anyway yeah

1724
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,780
what yeah and I haven't asked you the

1725
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:36,119
question and I don't want I don't want

1726
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:39,000
to take it on a kind of negative

1727
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:40,260
perspective but it's fine the one that I

1728
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,100
asked you remember

1729
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:45,119
um

1730
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:48,000
what would you what would you or what is

1731
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,460
your perspective or how could you see

1732
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,698
Europe

1733
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:57,840
legalizing or having adult

1734
01:11:52,698 --> 01:12:00,960
uh recreational cannabis and and uh

1735
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,640
licensed producers and you know the [ __ ]

1736
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,560
that you got going on

1737
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,960
I you know

1738
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:10,500
because people don't have I think people

1739
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,460
don't think about it often enough what

1740
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:16,140
kind of [ __ ] gate gate to hell it

1741
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,380
could open no

1742
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,780
so one thing that I didn't know and

1743
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,000
recently I've been kind of learning is

1744
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:26,099
there are some spots and countries in

1745
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,140
Europe that generally care about their

1746
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,820
people and don't want corporate taking

1747
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,440
over and want to protect their legacy

1748
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:32,759
Farmers but it sounds like that is few

1749
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:36,299
and far between

1750
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:38,039
usually money wins the day we've seen in

1751
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,840
the US like Harper's side was the big

1752
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:41,039
player for a long time they were the

1753
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,440
main one

1754
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,000
they didn't have the money to play they

1755
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:46,799
are gone like they they you know what I

1756
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,020
mean like Steve D'Angelo's crying over

1757
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,420
prop 64 that he pushed it now

1758
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,640
he didn't have the money to play

1759
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:55,260
so there is so much money going around

1760
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,659
that it's going to be enough to sway

1761
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:59,699
countries enough to buy all the

1762
01:12:57,658 --> 01:13:02,519
lobbyists they ever need to sway

1763
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:04,678
politicians to vote these things in the

1764
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,980
benefit of the pharmacies and

1765
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:11,219
realistically the only way I see I see

1766
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:13,919
any sort of of path for these plants and

1767
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:15,899
these genetics and and clones being

1768
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,119
saved and not being lost due to No One

1769
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:20,460
wanting them and it costing money to

1770
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:21,899
keep moms alive is doing exactly what

1771
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:25,439
we're doing

1772
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:26,819
one by one people talking they have any

1773
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:28,738
sort of influence over their Community

1774
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:31,380
they have any sort of care it doesn't

1775
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:33,779
even if you don't have influence build

1776
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,880
that influence make it happen make a

1777
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:37,738
[ __ ] make a stink stand up because

1778
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,960
there's ways like there are countries in

1779
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:42,079
Europe that seem to care

1780
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:45,179
I don't I mean maybe

1781
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:46,679
because I'm not there maybe it's a

1782
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:48,480
different story but from looking from

1783
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:49,800
the outside it seems like there are

1784
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:51,479
countries that are trying to keep

1785
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,460
corporate out and protect their legacy

1786
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:56,459
farmers and that will never happen in

1787
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:59,520
the U.S and just it will not our

1788
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,079
country's too money driven and corrupt

1789
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,239
um I saw what happened with California

1790
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:05,899
but before that I saw what happened in

1791
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,979
the Netherlands with um bedrockon

1792
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:09,059
and that's what I was like that's gonna

1793
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:11,099
happen here

1794
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,960
that is going to happen here one main

1795
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,940
source that's legal to grow where

1796
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,560
everybody has to buy from that's what I

1797
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:17,879
see happening in California and if

1798
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,140
Europe's not careful it's going to

1799
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:22,319
happen there and you're going to end up

1800
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:24,679
with Walmart weed and that sucks no

1801
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:24,679
choices

1802
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,460
yeah man that's uh I don't build you

1803
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:32,520
know I don't want to be an alarmist but

1804
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:34,679
that's what I often felt or with my gut

1805
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,620
feeling kind of I was like dude this can

1806
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,760
totally happen here and imagine that

1807
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:41,698
[ __ ]

1808
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,440
talented guys would beg for a job in a

1809
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:45,059
[ __ ] huge facility just to pay their

1810
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,879
bills and [ __ ] like that you know so

1811
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:50,640
what happened what happened in the U.S

1812
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,340
what I saw was people like not so dog

1813
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,739
for example or you know Legacy Farmers

1814
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:58,020
that have been doing this a long time

1815
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:59,698
they got hit you know when they were

1816
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:03,239
when they were on the black market side

1817
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:04,919
they got PTSD from getting raided and

1818
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:07,619
they got the choice to work with

1819
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:09,420
corporate and

1820
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:12,238
wanted to have a nice life for their

1821
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:15,179
families not be scared right these

1822
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:16,139
corporate guys raped them raped their

1823
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:18,719
knowledge

1824
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:20,400
raped their clones

1825
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,779
every last thing they could they

1826
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,759
squeezed the juice out of these Legacy

1827
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:25,859
Farmers I don't know anyone working for

1828
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,500
a big Corporation that's happy because

1829
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:30,658
it's happened to all of them and I don't

1830
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,100
like I can't think of one I can't not

1831
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:33,839
think of one person that worked for a

1832
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,520
big corporate thing that was a good

1833
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,619
person that was like

1834
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,960
happy with this I got a good deal here

1835
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:41,039
it just hasn't happened and I think it's

1836
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,658
probably going to happen over there in

1837
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,579
Europe the same way the Legacy Farmers

1838
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:45,779
there they're going to want to you know

1839
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:48,359
get a piece think they're gonna make

1840
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:50,639
some money and have a good life in legal

1841
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:52,198
life because they haven't had that

1842
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,780
think maybe they'll think they'll get

1843
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:56,879
retirement or whatever yeah I think uh

1844
01:15:54,779 --> 01:16:00,899
you know they think logic or very simple

1845
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:03,480
like maybe I also did I felt like an old

1846
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:06,238
football player a European soccer player

1847
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:08,879
who just wants a secure job in Saudi

1848
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:11,039
Arabia is playing playing as a the

1849
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,319
captain of the team there getting good

1850
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,960
you know paid well but

1851
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:18,479
has no [ __ ] future and no perspective

1852
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,859
yeah that's exactly what it is and and

1853
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,019
now

1854
01:16:19,859 --> 01:16:23,698
all those corporate places that that

1855
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,739
were hiring these people they bottomed

1856
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:28,319
out money-wise so all these Legacy

1857
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:29,819
Farmers that were already unhappy the

1858
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,679
bosses that were blinging wearing the

1859
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,479
Rolexes really making the money they're

1860
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,340
all broke too now they're all done

1861
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:37,500
selling their properties they're on the

1862
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,239
next the next commodity whatever the

1863
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,738
next hot commodity is because yeah

1864
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:43,139
that's what people should think about

1865
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:45,779
you know that these guys will move on

1866
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:48,960
they have more money than people all

1867
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:52,139
together you know ever have

1868
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,579
on hand to use in a project you know

1869
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,560
um yeah

1870
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:57,719
I don't want to be like I said I want to

1871
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,880
be alarmist but people have to be aware

1872
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:01,800
of that that will can totally happen

1873
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,060
because we have a lot of money due to

1874
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,420
the Central Europe

1875
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:08,880
people who spend a lot of money

1876
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:11,579
lots of money I mean America borrowed

1877
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,380
money from Central Europe to start like

1878
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:14,658
they you know I mean they started our

1879
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,739
country like

1880
01:17:14,658 --> 01:17:18,420
there's a lot of money there people

1881
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:19,678
forget how much money is going around in

1882
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:21,480
Central Europe and how important a

1883
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,760
player it is and I don't I don't

1884
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:26,459
consider it alarmist because we've

1885
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,840
watched it happen and Cycles happen and

1886
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,640
the history repeats itself and I

1887
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,800
consider it realist you know like a lot

1888
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:35,100
of people would consider it alarmist but

1889
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,199
it's realist like when prop 64 happened

1890
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,600
everybody said oh you're just making a

1891
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:42,238
stink shut up let these guys make their

1892
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,980
money they've worked hard you know yeah

1893
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:45,359
and I was screaming on top of my lungs

1894
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:48,539
and back then they called me an alarmist

1895
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:50,158
I was right it was [ __ ] right and I

1896
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,500
didn't want to be right I wanted to be

1897
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,759
so wrong I wanted to be the wrongest

1898
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,579
person ever and I would have been happy

1899
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:59,159
to be wrong but I think I just don't see

1900
01:17:56,579 --> 01:18:00,960
any difference absolutely unfortunately

1901
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:02,819
because there's money at the end of the

1902
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,980
whole thing and there's the same players

1903
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:07,279
going over to Europe at the same shitty

1904
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:10,619
seed sellers that failed in America or

1905
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:12,059
blew up in America went over there now

1906
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,920
because they see opportunities so like

1907
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,620
you know the aficionados the compounds

1908
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,119
go over there nobody trusted carpet

1909
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:19,380
treatment yeah they get the red carpet

1910
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:20,760
treatment because they don't really know

1911
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:22,679
how bad they [ __ ] everyone in America

1912
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,600
and why they're not here and why nobody

1913
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:26,520
likes it here you know but that's how it

1914
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,079
plays they they're playing telephone

1915
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,360
they're trying to catch up yours is

1916
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:33,000
yours passed

1917
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:36,719
yeah it's it's crazy and the only time

1918
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,880
will tell uh and so I wait what I hope

1919
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,439
what I hope this podcast achieves is

1920
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,359
that the people in Europe realize oh my

1921
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:43,919
God there's one of us that's over here

1922
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:46,259
that's dialed in that understands what's

1923
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,239
going on and I hope they all realize

1924
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,400
that and realize that it's you and talk

1925
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:51,799
to you and figure out how to become a

1926
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,599
part of the solution not the problem

1927
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,279
there are a bunch of guys already you

1928
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,679
know shout out to all my homies out

1929
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:00,119
there who who have this have a similar

1930
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:02,579
mindset and

1931
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:04,859
um I hope with with one of like Matthew

1932
01:19:02,579 --> 01:19:08,340
said like one of those podcasts can

1933
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:11,039
maybe attract more of you guys and after

1934
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:13,560
a certain time we we reach critical mass

1935
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:14,819
what I mean yeah we need we need more

1936
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,860
people in Central Europe and Europe

1937
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:18,779
period we have to have more people

1938
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:21,359
paying attention to this and and being

1939
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:22,679
willing to be a part of what we do and

1940
