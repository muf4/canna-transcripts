[Music]

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Syndicate this is something that we were

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,000
talking about before we hit the record

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,520
button which was maybe seeing a trend uh

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,558
seeing more

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,600
nld uh in people's work what do you guys

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,320
think about that like you know High lome

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,320
have you have you observed like more

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,879
interest in nlds recently in like the

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,438
American side of

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:13,798
things uh I have I think that's coming

29
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:15,559
uh from more people being able to homow

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,799
uh it's not it doesn't seem like it's

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,040
made

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,840
any any impact on the commercial Market

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,680
uh I've I've been

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,040
in yeah I mean I've been in dispensaries

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,040
in Maine and Colorado recently and when

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,439
you ask for a sativa they'll tell you

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,118
they have Sour Diesel and km4 and it's

38
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,599
like you know that's not that's not what

39
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm trying to smoke right now man uh but

40
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:48,280
I think with with the expansion of hom

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
growing in the US um a lot of people are

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,759
looking

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,240
for you know weed that they remember

44
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,319
from when they were younger or maybe

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,118
just a different experience um in it and

46
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,279
the seeds that I make and the plant that

47
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:07,159
I grow or I like the effect you know I

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,318
want I want weed that I can smoke and it

49
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,439
gets me motivated and makes me feel good

50
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:17,479
and you know I can I can I can get stuff

51
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:20,759
done um I like the the Psychedelic stuff

52
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,119
in the weed World um and I think a lot

53
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,518
of people do and a lot of people are

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,080
just starting to look for something

55
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,280
different and there's a ton of of good

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,599
work going on out there I mean the

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,680
the Band-Aid Haze thing is great um

58
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,399
there there's been a kind of a

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,599
Resurgence in it and I like seeing it I

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,879
wish there was more but I think

61
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:44,919
everybody should try some of these more

62
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,919
nld plants uh try the effect see where

63
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,799
you where you know it can be

64
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,439
life-changing if you're if you're just

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,879
smoking kush all the time or Kim dog all

66
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,919
the time you know and you switch and you

67
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,560
smoke a good mango Haze or a Band-Aid

68
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,719
Haze or Northern Lights Haze something

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,479
like that that I mean it it can it can

70
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,799
change your outlook on life you know

71
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,119
you're more present you're uh more

72
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,080
engaged it it's just um I really think

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,120
everybody should should get some

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,080
experience with it and you know kind of

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,120
get away from just the standard dull

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,159
High you get from a lot of the modern

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,719
genetics man random question for you are

78
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,318
there many blue or Bonnet nldd crosses

79
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,560
that you've done

80
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,598
any any plans for for some that's a good

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,840
question I don't know like off the top

82
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:41,079
of my head I think most of that stuff

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,640
was pretty Afghan dominant when I was uh

84
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
doing that work I had gotten done with a

85
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,798
bunch of years of doing nothing but

86
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
mostly I wouldn't say like truly narrow

87
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
Leaf dominant stuff but more leaning

88
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,878
that direction and I think during that

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,959
era I was I was taking a completely

90
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,239
different direction because the market

91
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,079
was totally different I'd like to see it

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,079
for sure but um I don't know I don't

93
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,760
know how much longer blue cono cash was

94
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,680
the only one I could think that's right

95
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,039
yeah but that one that was like uh that

96
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,959
plant was really weird because it was

97
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,639
narrow Leaf but it was short and

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,878
stocky yeah yeah the blue durb put out

99
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,959
some [ __ ] pretty tall [ __ ] man I 8

100
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,639
foot sideways that's one that I forgot

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,519
about yeah but still it's like I'm

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,560
thinking no no it went a completely

103
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,000
different direction that I thought it

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,079
would bar stomped it yeah yeah but yeah

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,519
I don't know I don't even know if

106
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,439
there's any plans or stuff like that if

107
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,839
there's any demand for it maybe you know

108
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,800
we'll

109
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,439
see yeah I was just thinking cuz the um

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,520
you know the blue side tends to be so

111
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,879
Squat and Afghan you know be it make for

112
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,120
an interesting hybrid

113
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,279
um Wally what's your take on like you

114
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,319
know it it sounds like you've you've

115
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,519
done a lot of nldd work and what's your

116
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,918
sense of its place in like the scene

117
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:02,279
modern scene do you see that do you see

118
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:05,279
it like kind of like uptrending now a

119
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,000
bit yeah absolutely it's also I was

120
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,519
going to say too because work like H&amp;L

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,680
is doing Crossing it with things people

122
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,839
are familiar with the the cam and stuff

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,560
like that and people are smoking that

124
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,519
going oh that that other bit in there

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,399
that I'm not familiar with which is the

126
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,318
mango Haze oh I wouldn't mind trying

127
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,638
that you know that that tends to help I

128
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,960
think but um everyone needs to smile

129
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,160
more man you know and and be more

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,560
uplifted and happier and that's what

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,600
that that's what that stuff's

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,439
for that also makes

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,160
bigger

134
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,160
what makes your dick

135
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,360
bigger oh now the SEC

136
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,439
out wood yeah numbers just Spike after

137
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,360
that spike in the

138
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:00,879
num creases the the turgent and and

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,879
girth yeah

140
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,598
an up surge now that's for

141
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,159
sure it started here guys it was this

142
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:15,719
show that started it all the

143
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,439
revolution just some false marketing um

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,919
well I mean we've been talking about

145
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,800
nlds but have you have you worked much

146
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:26,359
with um BLS in your time no not a lot

147
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,439
the best the closest I've had is you

148
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,400
know things like East Coast s Diesel and

149
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,279
that which obviously they're slightly

150
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,318
longer flowering than a lot of the more

151
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:40,318
pure Afghan sort of things I I was never

152
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:45,199
much of a fan of it but um my friend Mr

153
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:48,199
Moon he uh he used um uh Tom's deep

154
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,478
Chunk in uh in in one of his crosses he

155
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:54,000
made and um yeah I smoked a fair bit of

156
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,240
that but that dream dreamy sort of stuff

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,839
that makes you a bit sleepy and hungry

158
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,280
and um wasn't really I liked it you know

159
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,000
cuz I like weed but I don't need to be

160
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,318
sleepy and I could do without eating

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,319
sometimes

162
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,199
too that de that that MBS he made man

163
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,360
you just couldn't get away I was cooking

164
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,520
stuff you know like a lasagna or

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,800

sativa he'd ever had and um which

202
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,039
pricked my straight

away and um what do you say they they br

204
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,278
it for a few Generations but then I

205
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,360
wasn't really sure if they meant

206
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,519
generations of cannabis or generations

207
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,399
of the family you know but anyway it

208
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,240
doesn't matter he sent me some and I

209
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,360
grew that and uh man that's fantastic

210
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,240
weed um that sort of stuff that uh you

211
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,879
know today's stuff you know takes you to

212
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,079
zero to 100 in in in like three seconds

213
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,720
this stuff was gentle but it still got

214
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,919
you there you know and um it didn't dump

215
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,160
you like today's stuff does where you

216
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,240
you know you suddenly you're not that

217
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,278
high but you're sleepy and you you can't

218
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,759
be [ __ ] doing anything this stuff you

219
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,958
were just sort of like well I'm not

220

really high anymore but you you're

221
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:54,000
better off than you started yeah yeah I

222
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:57,240
like I like that sort of thing and um on

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,759
that yeah I I I was thinking about it

224
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,399
because I remember you asking me

225
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,399
previously and to be honest I have so

226
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,039
much trouble describing that actual

227
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,440
smell um that I can only say it smells

228
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,399
like Asian weed to

229
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,600
me like I can't dissect smells like I

230
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,879
know some guys on the forums and I I

231
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,480
listen to how they do it I [ __ ] how can

232
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,320
they get that out of there it's like my

233
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,278
my nose just doesn't do that for me or

234
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,320
whatever but um it's I guess it's mango

235
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,320
I know that smell in there but I can't

236
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,600
really dissect the rest of it it's just

237
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,959
just like a nice warm

238
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,278
mango Asian sort of smell that like the

239
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:42,039
skin of a Tha Green Mango sort of thing

240
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:45,039
more than Sweet Mango spices yeah 100%

241
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:50,879
got that sour sort of bit in it but

242
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:54,240
um but I um I I sent some to um oh M

243
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,240
just trying to think of his name but uh

244
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,320
and he asked why I selected why I cross

245
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,600
it with mango Haze which I did and what

246
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,720
was my goal and um Euphoria because they

247
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,879
were both euphoric and I thought they'd

248
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,839
complement one another and yeah they

249
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,600
they did so much so

250
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,399
fantastic is that

251
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,040

um La mango and um I sent we you know we

whole seed collection now I got a little

284
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,799
bit of IND stuff but mostly it's just

285
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,919

from you we have to get some over to H&amp;L

291

as well aric yep you know why we called

292
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:50,360
it super L I didn't actually call it

293
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,440
super L someone else did but it was uh a

294
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,680
bit of a pun uh with Neville to be

295
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
honest because he got everything was

296
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,120
super super silver ha super skunk and so

297
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,120
that was

298
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,680
out makes

299
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:14,959
sense I had a I had kind of a very broad

300
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,479
question for for both of you um and we

301
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,679
start with high and Lonesome which was

302
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,278
you know if you look back at your

303
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,198
breeding journey I I'm always curious

304
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,480
about the the kind of balance or tension

305
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,838
between

306
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,639
like how do I put it like a conscious

307
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,480
intentional plan

308
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,000
to make something versus like

309
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,360
reacting

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,039
um to maybe accidents or like I don't

311
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,199
know kind of like just going with what

312
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:49,319
you have had at hand does this question

313
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:52,919
make sense oh yeah yeah so I I always

314
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,680
have uh goals I always write down

315
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:59,078
projects that I want to do and then I

316
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,120
have this really bad habit of like when

317
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,919
whenever I have a little bit of

318
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,560
space or whenever I really just feel

319
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:10,159
like it I will pop a whole bunch of

320
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:13,838
something that's not on my schedule to

321
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,919
do um I right now have a lot of

322
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,959
seedlings that you know I wasn't really

323
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,838
planning on doing anything with uh but

324
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:25,638
now I I am um so I I try but I kind of

325
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,480
go with my go with my gut go with my

326
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,959
feeling uh on it you know I I don't know

327
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,440
I I don't know that I was planning on

328
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:37,679
doing a mango Haze project but I I love

329
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,240
those plants you know it's

330
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,719
um it's probably not the best move um

331
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,759
you know for the modern Market to do

332
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,480
something like that but it's what it's

333
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,800
what I wanted to do I I want to make

334
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,639
things that I want to smoke I want to

335
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:57,439
make things that um you know I think

336
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,360
other people should experience so I I've

337
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,800
tried the goal thing but I'm not very

338
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,800
good at

339
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,360
it yeah it's I feel like everyone must

340
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,600
deal with that that tension a bit of

341
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,240
like oh this is what I thought I was

342
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
going to do and then this happened and

343
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,639
then I I ended up doing this instead

344
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,079
right that kind of thing yeah yeah um

345
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,720
when I you know when I popped the mango

346
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:26,120
Haze I had I had a bunch of super silver

347
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,480
haze at the same time I had a bunch of

348
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:34,039
the um Neville's men Haze I had a bunch

349
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,959
of Northern Lights 5 Haze um and I kind

350
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,318
of thought I was going to go with

351
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:41,799
something like you know super silver

352
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:45,159
haze or Northern Lights 5 Haze but um

353
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,838
the mango Haze was just the one that I

354
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:51,838
liked the most um it's a it's a great

355
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,560
line I it's like we've said I mean it's

356
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,319
euphoric happy weed makes you feel good

357
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,239
and it definitely it definitely gets you

358
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:05,360
there um it's it's strong we it's good

359
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,720
and uh I just you know I wanted to see

360
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,440
that mashed up with some of the more

361
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:15,399
modern stuff to you know get people to

362
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,240
maybe deviate from just chasing clones

363
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,000
and trying out something that's a little

364
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,519
you know a little longer flowering but

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,519
has a completely different effect it'll

366
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,519
put you in a different head

367
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,559
space nice yeah I these are the kinds of

368
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,639
questions that like I want to ask more

369
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:36,039
kind of about how just like how life

370
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,399
impacts your projects and how like you

371
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,000
you know how you deal with that

372
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,958
basically and so yeah Wally same for you

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
like when you look back on the stuff

374
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,278
you've made and how it's all gone how

375
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,759
much of that was

376
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,278
like how much of that work is was was

377
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,199
you just working to plan versus you just

378
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,720
reacting to what you've been given or

379
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,919
you know what happened at at that

380
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,040
particular

381
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:02,240
time H it's probably 5050 but I I like

382
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:05,639
H&amp;L I go into everything with a with a

383
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,798
goal in mind and um it's it's about my

384
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,799
tastes and likes really but not

385
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:14,400
everybody has those I guess so I also

386
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,798
make other stuff and um so I I test

387
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,240
everything out but I I give it to

388
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:20,519
everyone else to test to and see what

389
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,279
they like you know and um not everyone

390
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,119
has the same taste as me so some stuff

391
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,838
that was unintentional and just an

392
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,439
accident can end up being something

393
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:35,038
that's appreciated more than stuff that

394
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I've had a goal to do you know um my my

395
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,440
my like is I guess similar to a couple

396
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,360
of the guys here maybe all of you but I

397
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,519
like sativa dominant stuff and um not

398
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:48,240
everybody does but um so we have to give

399
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,839
them options I suppose I I don't mind

400
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,798
something that gives them gives get you

401
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:55,439
to sleep too you know we all have to do

402
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:59,359
that at some point

403
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,919
but yeah of course well what about you

404
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,119
Matt like in with your work Matt how how

405
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,080
much of it would you say it's like okay

406
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,000
this this was all like planned intended

407
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,918
I got there I didn't get there versus

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,240
like oh yeah I had no idea it just

409
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,440
happened I I like to think that

410
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,000
everything was planned but I think I

411
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,919
Stumble [ __ ] my way through like the

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,679
first decade of doing anything

413
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,280
realistically I don't know how much of

414
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,280
it actually met goals um a lot of it was

415
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,918
just simp like especially in the

416
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,599
beginning was simple like I want to make

417
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,000
a you know like a for example stealth

418
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,000
Autoflower or um especially during the

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,200
the era where purples weren't as popular

420
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,880
or at least true breeding magenta

421
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,798
purples uh definitely that was all

422
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,240
intended um but like the end yeah I

423
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:45,400
don't know how often I met goals like up

424
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
the blue bonnet stuff but that's just

425
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,759
because it was so easy I think like

426
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,600
realistically to set a goal meet it be

427
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,599
happy with it so yeah I think I just

428
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,279
stumbled through everything the most

429
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,319
part or I could lie and say yeah was

430
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,119
[ __ ] from the beginning

431
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:05,200
yeah all work out [ __ ]

432
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:06,439
Stellar I mean no I think it's really

433
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,279
interesting and I don't think there's

434
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,480
anything wrong obviously with with with

435
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,000
having to you know deal with some

436
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,839
Randomness right or chance in life

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,519
they're both valid um D I mean yeah

438
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:22,759
people make like I look at 90% of the

439
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,240
market and these [ __ ] [ __ ] for brains or

440
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,640
you know like Crossing whatever to

441
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,798
whatever as long as it's cookies

442
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,000
releasing it bam it's elite so it's a

443
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,400
valid way of doing things I can't really

444
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,599
you know piss on it for the market

445
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,320
they're probably making more money and

446
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,798
have more interest and fame than any of

447
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,000
us will ever get but at the same time

448
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,119
it's not something I'm totally into but

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,240
I get

450
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,319
it I guess it's you know I I I I guess

451
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,440
there's like a sweet spot right um

452
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,200
somewhere it reminds me of like making

453
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,000
art or making music where there's going

454
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,720
to be a degree to which you have a plan

455
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,119
and there's going to be an element to

456
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,600
which like something's going to happen

457
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,959
that you're not expecting and it might

458
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,879
be good or it might not

459
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,840
be and I think that's just life I

460
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,000
guess yeah yeah do you plan to return to

461
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,480
any sativa stuff Maddie in the future

462
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,919
like that badana tie um it's got a lot

463
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,319
of [ __ ] esteem behind it I would have

464
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,038
loved to get to that have you got any

465
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,480
like stock that you could work forward

466
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,879
or I have so much um just even even like

467
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,279
heirloom land race stuff that I've

468
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,640
collected over the years but like also

469
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,879
as I've as I've learned more it's it's

470
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,960
it's harder for me to pop some of that

471
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,080
stuff knowing it's not in the right

472
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,279
climate and that I'm not going to see it

473
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,639
as it was intended

474
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,798
so expression wise I don't know how

475
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,080
valid it would be to like run it try to

476
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:45,359
make data points off of it use it

477
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,839
knowing how plastic cannabis is you know

478
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,399
and in expression I mean you know so it

479
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,959
could be hit or miss everywhere I'd like

480
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,720
to do more but the market suck so bad I

481
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
don't know I mean it is changing it's

482
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,120
definitely changing I mean high and

483
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,720
loansome stuff selling really well um so

484
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,038
yeah I'd like to do more of it but I

485
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,679
mean I don't really do much right now as

486
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,759
it is so we'll see see how the next year

487
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,840
goes yeah we'll have to I mean the first

488

516
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:31,119
forums you know Thailand again um but

517
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,200
was there any other recent work that

518
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,000
either of you wanted to talk about that

519
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,440
you've

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,119
done before we move on you got H

521
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,759
now um I've I'm always doing something

522
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,918
um I I've kind of been going back

523
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:54,359
through some of the appalache crosses

524
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,320
here recently um I just finished a

525
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:00,639
pollination with uh I called it Southern

526
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:04,639
Gothic it was Irene appalachin that one

527
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,320
was it was definitely not a Nar leaf

528
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,880
type I mean it's a very strong indicia

529
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:14,558
type plant but uh I hate I hate the Iran

530
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,200
plant I wanted I wanted something with

531
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:23,079
some of those characteristics but

532
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:25,679
without having to grow Irene uh so um I

533
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,839
I went through some I I kept a couple

534
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,120
plants around to maybe maybe mess with

535
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:35,038
some femin stuff down the road but you

536
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,759
know mostly just for head stash and um

537
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,519
while I was doing it I I made some

538
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:44,240
crossers I CED to some narrow Leaf stuff

539
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:47,079
uh I crossed to Sour Diesel so I've uh

540
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,359
I've started popping that stuff now and

541
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:54,119
looking through some of that uh I have a

542
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,759
above a hybrid I'm messing with now as

543
00:23:54,119 --> 00:24:00,678
well uh I'm in a weird position you know

544
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:04,000
I I like like to smoke a lot of sativas

545
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,440
but it kind of drives my wife crazy when

546
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,240
I don't have a bunch of indicas around

547
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,320
as well so I kind of my you know like

548
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,359
for the last few months it's been a lot

549
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,319
of a lot of haze hybrids um that we've

550
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:22,599
been smoking and I feel like I have to

551
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:26,720
do something else to appease that side

552
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:29,240
of my life um but you know there's some

553
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,000
there's some cool stuff um but I do plan

554
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,640
on on

555
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,480
doing doing some more sativa stuff um I

556
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,399
mean I plans going out in the next you

557
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,759
know month or two I'll be pollinating

558
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,759
some of

559
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,480
that nice and and Wally any any anything

560
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,798
else you want to say on any recent work

561
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,919
that we haven't touched on yet yeah I

562
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:58,879
just tossed a bunch of stuff in actually

563
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:04,080
some of it was h&amp; L's um East Coast s

564
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:08,000
appala but um some uh deep chunk OG sour

565
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:11,759
z99 whole bunch of stuff with s sort of

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,919
gasolin notes and then I put in um that

567
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,679
um that stuff I think might be webbed

568
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,919
hybrid because if those things if it is

569
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,759
that stuff then we're just going to up

570
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,600
the octane of those other things by

571
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,798
Miles if we we make make some crosses

572
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:31,519
with it so thought i' give it a for that

573
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:33,200
one yeah I thought I'd give it a go so

574
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,440
because people like that [ __ ] I that was

575
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,919
my real other than Liker tyers that you

576
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,240
know high octane massive strong turps I

577
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,600
was all over that stuff I loved it the

578
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,679
stronger the better

579
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:51,480
absolutely just if it didn't melt the

580
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,519
paint off the wall when you blew it out

581
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,519
[ __ ] she wasn't strong

582
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,240
enough yeah it sounds like it sounds

583
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,759
like it smelled Death Star which I know

584
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,919
y'all probably haven't seen that down

585
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:07,720
there but that's a really just

586
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:12,120
offensive yeah over the top I mean it's

587
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,880
like it's it's an insane plant I The

588
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:19,079
Taste doesn't come through but the smell

589
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,520
is so strong it smells just so fouled

590
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,038
that's the one thing with it the taste

591
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,038
yeah you're right the taste just doesn't

592
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,359
hit what the notes hit in the in the

593
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:31,000
smell for sure the the high also I I

594
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:33,439
don't think lives up to the smell no um

595
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,720
I think you know it would be really good

596
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,278
paired to like a kimy or something if

597
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,319
you want like that that nose but like

598
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:46,640
taking it up a level potency wise um but

599
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:49,599
yeah that's going to accentuate the

600
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,440
Aromas yeah

601
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,439
yeah you know I like that

602
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,480
too you got plans to dip into any of

603
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,759
your old like Tha or Le ocean seed stock

604
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,558
well no no it's just not the right time

605
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,798
of year I I can't get them to flower

606
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,038
outside at the moment and uh I want to

607
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,558
see how they do

608
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,359
outside uh because I don't know those

609
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,879
sort of things they don't really like

610
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,398
indoors and I I can't see how they do

611
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,520
well enough you know I can't see a

612
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,199
proper representation I want to see what

613
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,759
they how they go outside so I'll have to

614
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,840
wait till the later time of year when

615
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:30,679
our hours are heading downwards because

616
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:33,359
um I got a whole bunch of stuff like um

617
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,919
mango thae and chocolate thae

618
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,439
and um couple other things I must have

619
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,799
like about 10 or 12 at least sort of

620
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,240
thae stuff I've been sent and then

621
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,440
several LA and um some Mull and bimy

622
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,839
Madness as well but yeah it's just not

623
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,399
the time for those and um I'll save what

624
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,759
I think good in in what I'm doing now

625
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,959
and maybe I'll hit them with some you

626
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,798
know some LA and stuff like that and

627
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,798
make some repos and [ __ ] I in I need a

628
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,759
bigger fridge oh I just thought of

629
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:07,720
something a long time ago I mean it's

630
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,519
probably well over a decade ago we

631
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,480
talked about the Papu Nini gold oh yeah

632
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:13,798
pan gold yeah yeah yeah what do you know

633
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,798
about that I mean it's not really talked

634
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,759
about much by anyone but I know like for

635
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:21,398
for a lot of people it's a white

636
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:25,158
whale ah I had some I lived in p&amp;j when

637
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:26,199
I was a little kid and but um I had a

638
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,760
guy

639
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,558
uh uh when I lived in Melbourne I had an

640
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,038
Indian friend visit up here where I am

641
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:37,119
now and he bought some back some PNG

642
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:39,558
gold and um I grew it indoors and uh it

643
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,239
was hard to control it was a real uh uh

644
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:44,480
whipping chair sort of thing as you went

645
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,798
in the doors you know back back

646
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,159

647
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,759
um man that stuff

648
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,240
was amazing beautiful stuff so resinous

649
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:59,319
for like a land racy sort of thing you

650
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,679
know yeah and um such a strong beautiful

651
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:04,839
smell but um I have some stuff labeled

652
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,278
PNG I'll grow them and I'll see what

653
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:10,158
they look like but I don't know it's to

654
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,240
they don't have like you know seed shops

655
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,799
or anything over there so it's a bit

656
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,038
it's a bit random and you know you

657
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,639
probably get something called that from

658
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:21,398
there now but it may not have anything

659
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,000
to do with what we used to know it as

660
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,119
you know

661
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,759
yeah I think that's how it goes

662
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,439
sometimes E Yeah well if you find it put

663
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,319
me on the docket for it it's always

664
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,600
stuck with me you talking about it and

665
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,558
it always sounded super [ __ ]

666
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,199
interesting oh beautiful fruity

667
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:39,119
resinous

668
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
delicious you know the stuff that sticks

669
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,000
in your memory you know that's always

670
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,960
the good stuff hey and that stuff's

671
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,839
definitely in my memory that PNG call

672
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,880
beautiful stuff and it's such a unique

673
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,678
part of the world oh yeah crazy bit

674
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,480
crazy but it's a bit messed up once

675
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,519
bloody the

676
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,240
Western you know influence took a hold

677
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:06,240
of it over there it really didn't fa so

678
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,399
well see they having RS and stuff at the

679
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,880
moment that's they're having like riots

680
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:14,000
and stuff at the moment there' been some

681
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,840
natural disaster and yeah that the stink

682
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,960
bug weed mate that PNG gold you know

683
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:21,158
that stink bug weed that you talked

684
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,919
about no I don't think it was the same

685
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:27,720
no this was really fruy resonance okay

686
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,120
sort of stuff uh I GRE trying to think

687
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,360
when when that was must have been like

688
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,199
in the late 80s early 90s I was growing

689
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:38,199
that indoors but um I've got some stuff

690
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,200
actually here from a friend um of

691
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,440
overgrow who who's a local where I live

692
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,558
He's do living now but um he sent me

693
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,919
some stuff that he said it's it's it's

694
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:51,119
PNG crossed with our local wheed and um

695
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,720
he he rates it pretty highly especially

696
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,798
where mold resistance is concerned

697
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,159
because the area he lived in it just

698
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:02,839
rains all the time and uh um if a if a

699
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,880
plant can like survive there it's like

700
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,678
bulletproof and uh I'm pretty sure to

701
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,519
PNG stuff would have to be pretty rain

702
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,519
tolerant rain's a lot there it's a

703
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,120
jungle yeah yeah it's right on the

704
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,200
Equator so like the turnaround from

705
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:22,319
Seasons you know the I think my I

706
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,919
remember my mom saying was like uh only

707
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,240
two weeks of the year it's it didn't

708
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,320
rain at 4:00 every day but the rest of

709
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,558
the year it did you know it's like you

710
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,638
could set the clock by it every

711
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:37,119
afternoon 4:00 bang There was the

712
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:40,240
rain damn it have to be special for that

713
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:43,199
yeah yeah I reckon yeah but yeah save

714
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,440
them saving stuff like that uh I don't

715
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,319
really have

716
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,480
uh a good hope of them doing it you know

717
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:52,119
it's it's all very random

718
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,798
stuff

719
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,798
yeah even worse than

720
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,840
us right

721
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,880
I had a well booze had had a question

722
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,879
about um you see the state of your seed

723
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,880
collections the two of you um do you

724
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,360
want to tell us a bit about what that's

725
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,639
like uh while you you you mentioned the

726
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,278
fridge earlier you know how much of the

727
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:19,879
seed have you had to feed the birds you

728
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,079
know I don't know like how much stuff do

729
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,360
you guys

730
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:26,079
have you lost your seed collection at

731
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,479
one stage didn't you all like the the

732
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,480
main sort of one that you collected over

733
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,120
the years

734
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,960
I think at two stages or more sometimes

735
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,158
I don't know but uh I've I've gotten

736
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,798
some back from other people at times and

737
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,760
then you know after that you've

738
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:44,480
collected a whole lot more which I did

739
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:47,278
but um yeah I probably got um a few

740
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,120
kilos at least of seed I've got a whole

741
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,960
I've got a whole fridge that's dedicated

742
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:56,079
to to seed um but a lot of it's like

743
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,639
herbs and vegetables and and stuff like

744
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:01,439
that and uh it's it's it's the fridge I

745
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,240
don't open as much I tell a lie because

746
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,840
I keep the beer in there too I was going

747
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,120
to say not the not the bloody beer

748
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:09,599
fridge yeah it's the coldest one man so

749
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:14,000
it's the best for

750
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,000
it it does get cracked open now and

751
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,359
then

752
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,880
funny what about you H&amp;L what's your

753
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:30,798
stat like now it's I have a lot a lot of

754
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:34,760
uh a lot of seeds I lost mine um

755
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:38,879
probably I don't know 13 or 14 years ago

756
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:42,440
I had a fire and lost a ton of stuff um

757
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,519
but I've rebuilt it to all that it was

758
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:50,200
and more um I have a lot of

759
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:53,079
things from friends a lot of you know a

760
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,720
lot of things from breeders that I like

761
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:58,720
and then I have an ungodly amount of

762
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,038
things that I've made that I need to

763
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,159
look through um

764
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,879
it's you know I'm always trying to find

765
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,919
a

766
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,720
better organizational system but it's uh

767
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,759
it's the better part of a fridge and um

768
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:19,878
even some of the the older stuff I have

769
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:23,720
I have it in a deep freeze stored away

770
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,000
um which you know I've had good luck

771
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,480
with pulling stuff out of there and

772
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,559
popping it uh you know it just trying to

773
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,358
trying to beat time or slow down time

774
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,759
because there's a ton of stuff I have

775
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:40,878
that I really want to check out and dive

776
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,879
into but especially with some of these

777
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:47,039
longer flowering things I mean you got

778
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:50,639
to set aside half a year or more um just

779
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:53,480
to you know check out a line so I have a

780
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:59,079
pretty giant collection that I will

781
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,079
never get to 75% of

782
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,800
I think that sounds like everybody yeah

783
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:09,440
be yeah I like like Wally said kilos of

784
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,000
seeds yeah do you like want to sort them

785
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,039
in like the year that I made or the the

786
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,960
variety that when you come up with a why

787
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,679
I do it let me know that's why I need

788
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,559
to I keep thinking I find something but

789
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,159
it never really works out I have stuff

790
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:27,759
in jars I have stuff in vials I have

791
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:31,719
bags I have all kinds of things it's not

792
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,359
there is no standardized system in my

793
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:35,199
I'm exactly the same it's all over the

794
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,559
show that's why I lose stuff you go to

795
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:42,598
look I know it's in here but oh

796
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:45,078
yeah yeah yeah what about Matt Matt

797
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,760
what's the state of your collection like

798
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:51,039
I mean there's a bunch of [ __ ] it's it's

799
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,160
big bags like I don't know 10 gallon

800
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:56,239
Ziploc bags stuffed in a fridge totally

801
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,559
unorganized so yeah I you know me I

802
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,039
don't organize [ __ ] so when people ask

803
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,960
for certain things I'm like yeah I got

804
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:04,440
that and it'll take me a year or two to

805
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,639
find it poor poor local keeps wanting BR

806
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,679
the the C Mist the old original pack of

807
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,400
C mist from serus I'm like yeah I got

808
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:12,960
that I got that every time I pull it out

809
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,960
and go to send it to him I lose it so

810
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,599
yeah I feel bad it's how it goes

811
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,679
like is it like the first round CI

812
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,920
missed first drop yeah it's it's man

813
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,440
it's um well I don't know about first

814
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,960
drop but it was 2 I want to say it was

815
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,200
99 to 2000 when it was made I asked a

816
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,920
sign based on the catalog number so it's

817
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,559
just right there at that at that period

818
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,280
where it's still probably a valid pull

819
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:42,318
of it oh yeah you need to find those I

820

849
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,280
the moment have you got a bunch of haze

850
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,119
Cuts in depth at the moment or what are

851
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,440
you planning on growing sa no in in my

852
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,599
depth right now it's more well actually

853
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:11,119
I do have A5 out there um but I

854
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:15,079
have some Sour some

855
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:21,240
Shoreline uh the fcut

OG uh EB a bunch of a bunch of things uh

857
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:28,199

858
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,679
for my full term and that is

859
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,519
uh kind of all over the place I have a

860
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:35,519
lot of super silver haze I'm doing

861
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,800
because that's kind of a standby

862
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:43,079
probably do an increase on those as well

863
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:48,400
because um you know it's about that time

864
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:50,039
uh I popped some of the sweet

865
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,400

good old Rob Clark was there smoking

874
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,960
pretty hard on those is a really good

875
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:23,598
time uh do you like

876
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,599
the I do it's you know it's a bit heavy

877
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,760
for me it's like bedtime lead um yeah

878
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:33,039

879
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,839
know I can I can smoke them if I keep

880
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,239
going and smoking them throughout the

881
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,039
day I'm fine but if I let it lag a

882
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,679
little too long I just want to take a

883
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,920
nap yeah sure so so i' I've gotten to

884
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,838
the point where that's kind of like

885
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,358
that's stuff I smoke when the Sun goes

886
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:52,679
down I don't um I I can't smoke it all

887
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:58,318
day like I used

888
00:39:52,679 --> 00:40:01,719
to um but yeah I popped all that um

889
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:06,719

890
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:10,439
C5 uh Destroyer which sounds incredible

891
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:13,719
um I popped some more of Wally's uh

892
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:18,000
Neville's Haze mango Haze because that

893
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:22,439
one uh that one ended up being really

894
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:26,519
really good smoke um I kind of I I dried

895
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,358
it and you know cured it and I put it in

896
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,400
jars I smoked a little bit of it and I

897
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:33,440
was like oh yeah that's cool it's you a

898
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,480
little Ser pentalene to it um but very

899
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,200
Neville's Haze leaning and I I kind of

900
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,440
just left it

901
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,960
um for probably six or seven months five

902
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,760
or six seven months something like that

903
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,039
and uh then I I got back into it

904
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,520
recently and that [ __ ] will I mean it

905
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,838
makes your forehead sweat you gotta like

906
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,358
you got to go out and take a walk um

907
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:01,199
that that shit'll knock you on your ass

908
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:03,440
it's very racy very strong um get a

909
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,159
moving weed uh so I pop some more of

910
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,920
those cuz uh they they did well outdoor

911
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:12,598
here um it actually it triggered a lot

912
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,680
quicker than mango Haye so they ended up

913
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,720
finishing before the mango Hayes which

914
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:19,519
surprised

915
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:23,759
me what was that the C5 Neville was it

916
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:27,880
H&amp;L no that was the nevel's mango oh

917
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:33,319
mango did you make a C5 did you make C5

918
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:38,160
nevs yeah um C5 mango Nevels yeah that's

919
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:40,559
I this them they were um but um I tell

920
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,639
you what I I wonder if my friend that I

921
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,000
grew with didn't mix some seeds in

922
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,039
didn't put end up with some L mango ones

923
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,760
in there because the difference between

924
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,159
the flowering on some and the others man

925
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,319
was like six weeks different which I

926
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,318
don't know maybe that's like a Neville's

927
00:41:54,318 --> 00:42:00,599
hazy leaning thing who knows but just

928
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:02,838
seemed like [ __ ] miles out but uh

929
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,920
really good though like

930
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:09,119
fantastic but um uh the Neville's Haze

931
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,240
surprised me a little bit with its early

932
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:15,358
maturing and I I've seen some from

933
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,399
Shanty go the you know long distance but

934
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,159
other ones were quite early and I always

935
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,838
wondered maybe there was an F2 or

936
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:24,679
whatever but you know I'm not to say

937
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:28,719
anyone's the purity of anyone's stuff

938
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:31,879
but um is that one you did an increase

939
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,879
on I didn't I only had uh I got a little

940
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,240
bit of Neville's haes from a friend

941
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,760
online which he said he it's pre

942
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:42,239
20102 and for some reason that's a cut

943
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,599
off for people where they think it might

944
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,959
have been different after that whether

945
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:52,200
it was or not I no idea

946
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:55,760
but still a large large Cola you know

947
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:58,159
earlier maturing larger Cola not not as

948
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,800
satar as

949
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,639
some other people I've seen grow you

950
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,039
know what I mean but you know it's not

951
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,838
not really an F1 so you can have [ __ ]

952
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:12,358
a lot of uh differences in

953
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:16,519
them a lot of variation yeah we it's uh

954
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:19,440
it's we actually uh could finish most

955
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,920
fenos of Neville ha here I mean You' get

956
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,559
the frost hitting them a little bit but

957
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,000
it you know you could get them done here

958
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:32,960
uh pretty consistently it

959
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,599
was yeah than you think outdoor yeah you

960
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,079
find it really strong super

961
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:42,359
strong uh yeah but to me it takes a

962
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:46,800
while um like as they cure they get

963
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:49,639
strong yeah uh you know the Neville in

964
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,400
particular the A5 is like that too um

965
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:54,838
yeah you know if you smoke it fresh it's

966
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,720
okay um but with a lot of this longer

967
00:43:54,838 --> 00:44:00,199

African um lady that you found was on

some Aussie Forum right or was that just

996
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,359
the no this thing called leaf leaf I

997
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:19,358
think something like that I don't know

998
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,279
how I ended up there I'd no long got a

999
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:25,358
computer man so it's like look up weed

1000
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,480
forums or chats or talks or whatever and

1001
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:30,920
um yeah it was like some something

1002
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:34,679
called Leaf I think and and that's where

1003
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,480
I met that African chick and um she

1004
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:41,558
wanted to uh oh she had an ad there to

1005
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,079
selling African weed right and so i'

1006
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:45,920
I've messaged her and said do you

1007
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,240

1008
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,480

1009
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:55,399
not try it and it was it was cheap as F

1010
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,559
so and it was Prett 9 911 too so I think

1011
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,880
borders like you know got a bit stricter

1012
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,559
after that but during those times um

1013
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,440
things were a little bit more open and

1014
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,680
um so yeah I I sent her some money and

1015
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,519

might be him still you know was like

1129
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,400
years and years later and when he

1130

1207
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:20,199
um Cheo a German fell that lived down

1208
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:23,279
there for ages too well I took some I

1209
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:26,239
took some hash with me and like um

1210
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,559
really good hash and and I so I go to

1211
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:32,519
like do this entry with him and and he

1212
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:36,480
says we we don't even have a

1213
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:38,639
h you know a category for that and um

1214
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,119
but we'll take it you know I said oh

1215
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,759
yeah okay and so we get to like there's

1216
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:46,519
all the photographers in that do looking

1217
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,480
at the you know the entrance and I look

1218
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:50,199
at this hash and I think it's not like

1219
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,000
the ball I gave him I'm sure you know

1220
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:55,399
it's like a gram you know and he comes

1221
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,199
over to me and says he says I'm not

1222
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,798
[ __ ] putting that hash that's just

1223
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,399
Prime we're keeping that [ __ ] we just

1224
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,280
put a little bit

1225
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,480
in funny

1226
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,280
Bugger I think that was the year that

1227
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,039
Jason King was there for canb Bible 2 or

1228
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,319
three I it was canb Bible 2 because I

1229
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,039
remember seeing I think I sent you a

1230
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,000
photo cuz your golden pineapple was

1231
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:17,000
canab 3 but in number two there was a

1232
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
pick of him in Nim with like um they had

1233
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,559
like bunch of Mr knce so G13 hash plant

1234
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,559
crosses they had um Tony's Blackberry

1235
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,839
which I always wanted to see the Malay

1236
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,359
one um and they had one picture of a bit

1237
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,400
of hash on a table so I Reon that's the

1238
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:34,000
year that you were there oh

1239
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,760
yeah yeah know that probably is to be

1240
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,798
honest like I would have thought that

1241
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,280
you know it would have been the

1242
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,719
strongest of everything they had there

1243
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,640
and maybe it was but it didn't score as

1244
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,480
well because I heard a bunch of them

1245
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,358
complaining that they couldn't judge

1246
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,119
anything after that it [ __ ] them up

1247
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:51,159
and

1248
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,838
whatever [ __ ] up the

1249
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:56,440
tolerance yeah yeah I haven't been down

1250
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,480
I used to go often like I went for years

1251
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,920
cuz when I come back from Europe um the

1252
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,719
only weed I could find was just that

1253
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,838
[ __ ] pgr [ __ ] and I was like n not

1254
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:06,919
smoking it like that's what I come up on

1255
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,318
basically um from like an you know early

1256
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,680
age that's all I saw and then when I

1257
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,558
went to Europe they had in Switzerland

1258
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:13,759
mostly Albanian weed but it was pretty

1259
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,240
good man it was just obviously some

1260
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,160
Dutch stuff that they were growing and

1261
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,919
then going to Amsterdam too so then

1262
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:20,679
coming back home only having access to

1263
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,400
that I was like I'm not going to do so I

1264
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:24,639
pretty much went to niman like every two

1265
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,318
weeks for [ __ ] years just go back

1266
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,558
down back and forth back and forth like

1267
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:29,719
cuz there was always good stuff like

1268
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:31,079
people rag on it but if you like know

1269
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,919
someone down there like when the lane

1270
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,000
boys were there they had fantastic pot

1271
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,838
and then um afterwards you could always

1272
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,838
find good stuff too if you know like you

1273
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:40,480
going to but I haven't been in the dogs

1274
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:41,920
age now but I'd like to go back and see

1275
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,480
if I could find Tony or something

1276
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,200
because yeah he had some good stuff yeah

1277
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,199
the key is to knowing someone otherwise

1278
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:51,279
you're just going to end up with some

1279
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:53,598
rubbish to perhaps unselected rubbishy

1280
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,760
sort of that's it's what they like they

1281
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,280
said when I spoke with them a little bit

1282
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,319
about it that it's just from the

1283
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,400
tourists you know that they they just

1284
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:04,239
want to make some money out of their

1285
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:07,318
rubbish or whatever but

1286
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:09,000

1288

1289

barely even got to half the stuff we got

1290
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,400
like four er stuff to get to as well but

1291
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,519
I know there's one question I'll

1292

little fell he's not a big man he was

1331
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:06,400
just a little blood and I remember

1332
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:09,839
looking at him and thinking this dude's

1333
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,720
like on something and uh he's looking at

1334
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,759
me like and I could see the look in his

1335
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:17,279
face and he's singing the same about me

1336
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,280
Fu this dude's on something you

1337
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,358
know yeah that was that's incredible

1338
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:22,358
that's

1339
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,599
incredible he died in a car accident he

1340
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,559
[ __ ] and ran off the road what they call

1341
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,318
that uh

1342
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,760
aquaplaning uh yeah kind of like aquip

1343
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,838
plan and uh he's he had several wives

1344
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,640
they lived in like little commune and

1345
00:59:38,838 --> 00:59:42,358
like you know he's a couple of wives and

1346
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,038
and the wives like just like move next

1347
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,759
door build a house he gets another wife

1348
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:50,440
or whatever bit [ __ ] weird is his

1349
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,240
original wife did she come over with him

1350
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,599
did his original wife come over with him

1351
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:56,838
because I think she was the chemist

1352
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:59,000
like absolutely yeah that that was the

1353
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:01,078
lady making the stuff yeah you know she

1354
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,599
and she's still alive as far as I know

1355
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:05,640
and she's the yeah she was the original

1356
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:10,079
one but then he had some other yeah just

1357
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:11,759
out the back here yeah and um I I I got

1358
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,640
offered to buy all his stuff after he

1359
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,680
