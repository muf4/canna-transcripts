74
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:14,108
been hitting up people telling them like

75
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,608

111
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:55,489
weed Maps get the [ __ ] out of here with

112
00:05:49,759 --> 00:06:00,379
that what weed Maps weed maps the

113
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,340
[ __ ] Craigslist of collectives [ __ ]

114
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,240
weed Maps

115
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:07,609
I'll see ya right now [ __ ] weed Babs

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,300
I'll never work with weed maps you guys

117
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,038
are [ __ ] corporate [ __ ] suck a

118
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,680
dick so that's all I gotta say about

119
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,240
that weed Maps they don't need to be

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,129
trying to pretend like they can do what

121
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,829
we do and that's an insult that they

122
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:24,168
would even be able to [ __ ] try to

123
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:26,209
pull that off it sucks because they also

124
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:27,469
know a lot of these guys don't know

125
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,180
anything about the weed business they

126
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,400
don't know who makes what they don't

127
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,019
know who's who they don't know any of

128
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,060
that they're they're new to this so when

129
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:38,389
weed Maps hits them up they think that

130
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,379
is a they think that's breeding man and

131
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,879
they don't know any better

132
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:43,189
so I talked to

133
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,800
the owner of [ __ ] Erik Brunetti it's

134
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:48,980
one of Bryn's friends Brina actually set

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,000
that up and which is really rad you know

136
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,350
I think that's [ __ ] rad and he's new

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,329
to the business so I invited him to come

138
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,120
on watch the live feed if he if he has

139
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:00,740
time and think about it but I would be

140
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,180
stoked to do something with them that

141
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,990
would be one that would be really stoked

142
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,569
to do you know yeah mids map they can go

143
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,220

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,879
scientist in any of his notations if

163
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:16,909
anybody is an expert on his lines or

164
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,230
notations let me know to falsify the

165
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:23,120
true lineage of strains that they're

166
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:27,500
releasing every [ __ ] day 90% of

167
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,730
breeders do that falsified lineage and

168
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,279
there's all kinds of reasons for doing

169
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:35,110
it one some people think that it's

170
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,429
protecting their intellectual properties

171
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:44,840
yeah Tom's dad was the chemist that's

172
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:46,399
correct some people do it because they

173
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,509
don't have the lines they really have

174
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,399
and they want to yeah we'll be talking

175
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,929
tissue a culture tissue culture again

176
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,579
hopefully Friday if everything goes

177
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:57,559
alright

178
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,850
sometimes they do it because they they

179
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,169
want to lie about strange that they

180
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,560
don't have and they wanted to sell

181
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,179
better

182
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,619
that's like ninety ninety percent of

183
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:06,829
people who do rename are gonna do that

184
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,610
90 percent 90 percent 90 percent but no

185
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,620
really is it's that bad some people do

186
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,840
it on accident because they they don't

187
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,669
know how to chase down provenance and

188
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:21,889
someone tells them they have a line and

189
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:23,839
they just pass it on as as bolt you know

190
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:28,879
it's [ __ ] but they think it's real

191
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,379
and a lot of guys make it up because

192
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,480
they want to pretend to be breeders that

193
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:35,120
they aren't and I think that's a good

194
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
majority of to man a lot of people want

195
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,310
to pretend to be breeders want to

196
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,740
pretend to have the knowledge that they

197
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:42,409
don't and again I challenge any of them

198
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,539
to do with the [ __ ] I do come on here

199
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,669
let everyone fire questions at you about

200
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:47,809
breeding about any of this [ __ ] let's

201
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,009
see if you can really answer some

202
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:52,039
[ __ ] questions let's see if you can

203
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,460
make sense you know I challenge all of

204
00:09:52,039 --> 00:10:00,769
them to do it there's very few who will

205
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:06,830
karma does I know there's other people

206
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:08,210
that mike exotic Mike comes on here you

207
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,950
know there's all there's people come on

208
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,560
here usually stand up to it but it's is

209
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,900
not very many man there's not very many

210
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:23,569
you know Mosca can do it also can do it

211
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:27,350
real well not many people can how many

212
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:36,050
land races do I think existed unknown

213
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:38,149
quantity oh [ __ ] I can't remember now

214
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,829
was it the scientist or the chemist I

215
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,970
can't [ __ ] remember I need to find

216
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,080
out exactly what it is what was it was

217
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,639
it the scientist - Kevin I think the

218
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:52,970
chemist right I want to say the chemist

219
00:10:49,639 --> 00:11:00,259
this was a guy I want to see it was up

220
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:02,360
north and yeah you know I've asked Ken

221
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,309
Rado several times to come alive and he

222
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,539
said he would but he hasn't so hopefully

223
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:07,459
hopefully he will come on

224
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:10,099
yeah the chemist

225
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,250
I said scientist I met chemistry it's

226
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:19,670
been a long [ __ ] day long day the

227
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:25,899
chemist yeah [ __ ] it I'll just tell the

228
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:30,469
story one of our friends bought property

229
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:32,299
after Tom's dad passed and I assume okay

230
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,700
this is where there's some assumption so

231
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:37,819
they brought property from a man who was

232
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,800
known as the chemist his family after he

233
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,750
passed away when they were tearing down

234
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,179
the drywall and stuff they found a nice

235
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,929
big [ __ ] stash of seeds labeled from

236
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:49,849
1982 up till I can't remember what the

237
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:53,629
last that most current one was but it

238
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,340
was several years ago and they were just

239
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,059
stuffed in the wall and they're all

240
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,590
labeled but they're named labeled using

241
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:05,239
whatever notations he had so a lot of

242
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,040
them are like CC X whatever there's some

243
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,240
of them are labeled with China Creek or

244
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:14,449
China creep or China Creek I have I have

245
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,250
pictures of all of them so we're just

246
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,780
trying to figure it out we're just

247
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,429
trying to figure it out I didn't want to

248
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,990
hit up tom directly because he doesn't

249
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:23,089
want people like hitting him up I don't

250
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,970
think his name on here is not very well

251
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,379
known and I don't want to bug him and I

252
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,129
also don't want him to say hey man

253
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,570
that's mine that's mine you know so but

254
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,149
I would really love to have him involved

255
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,100
with this I mean they technically it's

256
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,809
it's whoever bought the property because

257
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,180
they paid for everything on it and if

258
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:46,519
that was in the wall me yeah crybaby's

259
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,899
been working with me on this really hard

260
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,569
and he's done some amazing research

261
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:53,539
already already done some amazing

262
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,400
research but yeah we want to get these

263
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,939
figured out and I think the only way to

264
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,269
do it

265
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,150
really is gonna be with Tom's help like

266
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,939
to get it exactly right but there's

267
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,110
there's gonna be some cool [ __ ] in there

268
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,800
looks like some cool [ __ ] right cry-baby

269
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:17,289
he saw the pictures so yeah a lot of

270
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:19,419
notations earliest one was 1982 yeah

271
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,799
um it's gonna be preserved I don't know

272
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,870
about released it's at least gonna be

273
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,969
purser pre be preserved and that's the

274
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,519
whole point is preservation it's not

275
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:31,089
like banking off of Tom Hills dad stuff

276
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:36,490
that's not anyone's goal at all but it

277
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:37,990
will be preserved absolutely and I want

278
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,519
to make sure that this is even his dad

279
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:48,940
what if there's another dude Nome is

280
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:53,230
known as a chemist you know yeah I don't

281
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,579
know man Tom's never been nice to me Tom

282
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,949
has never been nice to me so I can't

283
00:13:54,578 --> 00:14:02,739
quite say that he would be honored to

284
00:13:56,948 --> 00:14:04,419
help anything but yeah yeah exactly the

285
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,709
notations are very confusing and that's

286
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:09,039
why it's like one of those ones I was

287
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:13,599
like see see I get DC and I'm can't see

288
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:19,088
see see em mmm you know it's it's it's

289
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:22,839
pretty weird what happened to that crook

290
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:25,120
Crockett cheap I don't know I may have

291
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,339
heard some I'll tell you what I know

292
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,129
and and what I know may not even be

293
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:33,269
correct I was called by somebody

294
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:35,980
yesterday and told that there may be

295
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,490
some how the Crockett got fired over

296
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,750
doing something bad or incorrectly and I

297
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,129
don't know who fired him I don't even

298
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,379
know who would hire Crockett in the

299
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:45,698
first place but they may have been fired

300
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't even know if it's true it might

301
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:48,219
not even Crockett might have been

302
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
referring to someone else but that's why

303
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,139
I asked like I did I was like I don't

304
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,730
know what it is but yeah now my buddy

305
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,230
you hear let's see where we got where

306
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,149
command just asked me a question and I

307
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,240
don't want to miss éxito moment why

308
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:03,698
don't many folks read with EC sd1 the

309
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,470
original clone is still hard to find the

310
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:06,879
original clone there's a lot of sour D

311
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,850
crosses but most of them aren't done

312
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,250
with the clone my buddy karma does

313
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,949
amazing work with sour D his headbangers

314
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:18,159
[ __ ] top [ __ ] knotch if you want a

315
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:22,809
good sour line I'm finishing up a sour

316
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,578
line right now using the clone I think a

317
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:27,129
lot of people do it's just it's just

318
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:30,309
trusting someone to have a legit sour

319
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,000
lying you know but yeah I see sour

320
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:36,039
accounts

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,639
we still they just found him with a

of but um yeah he has a sour it's legit

325
00:15:49,320 --> 00:16:02,890
no sour is not cams scum fee a cam 91 is

326
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:03,849
not the same thing the according to Adam

Dunn's podcast

328
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:11,009
everything is cam 91 but no that is not

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,009
how it works

330
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,950
anything good in that h som her surgery

331
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
i have no idea i haven't seen that

332
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:26,259
didn't know anything about it

333
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:31,029
oh no I don't even want to watch drugs

334
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:33,460

diesel in some circles or Amish diesel

337
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:45,129
as well kind of coffee I'm drinking area

338
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,629
dandelion coffee from Hawaii um I can't

339
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:51,429
remember what the I like one of my

342
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,389
out on the island I trade them seats for

343
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,950
this for the Kona

344
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,389
so it works out pretty well I don't mind

345
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:06,068
bartering for a good coffee I took a lot

346
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:08,170
of coffee but this is actually starbucks

what is day wrecker is it someone's

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,369
you ask man I wasn't around

353

00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:38,679
many people who've claimed XYZ is

original geez let cetera what is sprite

359

385
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:22,270
correlations between frost emails and

386
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,600
progeny that's that's one that's up for

387
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:27,700
debate really I'm gonna have to to say

388
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,619
that quarterly there isn't necessarily a

389
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,400
correlation between every frost email

390
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:35,500
and progeny every single mail not just

391
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,019
from a single line like not all males

392
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,599
from a single line breed the same the

393
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:41,920
correlation cannot be it's just there's

394
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,459
too many variables to answer that

395
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,740
question and you would never know until

396
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,769
you out cross it and see and that's

397
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,710
that's the best answer I can give you

398
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:55,329
out cross it run the lines it's just

399
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,519
there's there's no correlation between

400
00:19:55,329 --> 00:20:00,009
frosty males and frosty progeny that is

401
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,980
100 percent of the time there may even

402
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:05,140
be a correlation between frosty males

403
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,490
and female dominance but again not a

404
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,810
hundred percent at the time so it's

405
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,190
really it's really hard to answer that

406
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:12,940
question with so many variables at play

407
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:19,150
you might have a frosty male and a

408
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:22,480
female that is not so resinous and

409
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:25,600
actually you may owe a male coat

410
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,759
dominant I want to say or male dominant

411
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,159
even though it's expressing is female

412
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,490
and it would completely X out any kind

413
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,410
of female dominance in the progeny and

414
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,019
and easy either tilt it back to male

415
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,430
dominance even or just kind of both and

416
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:42,339
go straight down the middle so there's

417
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:47,529
so much there's so much to that and I am

418
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:49,179
a frosty male did you see Scott's

419
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,200
miracle grows dude that was only a

420
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,759
matter of time before they bought

421
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,269
sunlight supply the biggest the biggest

422
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,650
appliers

423
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:58,839
Oh what do you look for a progeny would

424
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,060
breeding with og that just depends on

425
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,220
the project man depends on the project I

426
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:08,559
don't just check pollen and see what

427
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:10,000
happens do you think breeders ever load

428
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,069
their packs with famine claim their eggs

429
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,960
I have three separate packs from drummer

430
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:17,109
turn out to have 28 females to males

431
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:25,180
they've all regular seeds I don't think

432
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:28,349
any breeder would make a reverse line B

433
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,850
and stuff it in regular packs knowingly

434
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:34,059
unless I mean

435
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:35,859
would intentionally make a reverse line

436
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:39,039
and stuff it in packs like that because

437
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:42,339
it costs a shitload more to make a

438
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:46,059
reverse line not only in in electricity

439
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:48,459
but in space-time amount of pollen you

440
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,349
don't get as many seeds etc but if

441
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,650
someone accidentally heard their plants

442
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:56,169
and sold those seeds it would still have

443
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,400
a female dominance with a high high

444
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:04,060
probability of hermaphroditism in most

445
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,519
environments easy stress response and

446
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,529
that in that case you would still see a

447
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:12,039
high female dominance but also a high

448
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:15,750
herb dominance and yeah that in that

449
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:18,670
case I would say that would probably be

450
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,869
the the most likely candidate I mean I

451
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,519
don't know if that's what happened with

452
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,069
him at all I wouldn't I wouldn't claim

453
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,079
to know but but that's that's in that

454
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:27,939
situation that's what you get if you

455
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,649
were to open pollinate the butters I'd

456
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,539
have a whole lot of variants of the

457
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,800
babies and most which you would have

458
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,240
already seen or work throughout the

459
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,899
years the right variant afghani correct

460
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,900
correct correct

461
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:53,740
I'll makes everything too dark it's

462
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,490
getting hard to read today and up for

463
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,740
too long today

464
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:01,089
I do like rubber groomers a nice guy

465
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,410
and I've seen a lot of good stuff from

466
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,480
his plants you know a lot of its uh

467
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,420
Mendel breath crosses but I mean if it's

468
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,160
good is good you know where do you think

469
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,900
the peanut nose in p90 one comes from

470
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,640
that's a hard question I'm gonna say I'm

471
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:17,980
gonna have to say it's it's whatever

472
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,270
skunk or Afghani based skunk that they

473
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,269
used every my guess

474
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,440
who got I mean this

475
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,200
Oh

476
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,520
okay

477
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:48,009
any info on compound genetics yeah good

478
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:52,779
guys they have a lot of really good cuts

479
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:54,700
and they're doing some heavy seed baking

480
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:57,210
projects as opposed to breeding projects

481
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,410
but there's there's some absolutely

482
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,410
stellar progeny in those as well

483
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,819
nope never had the dumpster never worked

484
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:09,519
with it the name just turned me off it's

485
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:16,000
kind of like that like chemo I've had it

486
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:17,889
never worked with it and it was just a

487
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,990
name man it was a big turn-off it was a

488
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,030
big turn-off and like I felt like if I

489
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,529
smoked chemo all my hair would fall out

490
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,680
and I'd just be all weak and withered

491
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:29,079
you know that's one of those things

492
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,930
doctor Candyman Lloyd yeah do you dr.

493
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,579
Candyman had some he was and he declared

494
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,890
himself the king pollen sucker but you

495
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:36,490
know what he had some badass [ __ ] back

496
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,650
in the day

497
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,539
bad ass [ __ ] he was an excellent string

498
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:44,920
collector and he you know he was doing

499
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:46,779
better work than a lot of breeders who

500
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,730
were trying to do selections and and I

501
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:51,970
think that that happens a lot when

502
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,160
people know good weed and they're good

503
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,870
at selecting a male and you can still

504
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,320
get some excellent progeny that way I

505
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:04,599
could think of a a ton of instances of

506
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:07,210
people out out how would I put this

507
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,000
making venner progeny than breeders who

508
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,340
called himself readers doing selections

509
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,690
you know what I mean like it happens a

510
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,250
lot and in that case Lloyd was doing

511
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,029
that back in the day he had some [ __ ]

512
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,220
rad [ __ ]

513
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:20,440
uija I would say he had his much rad

514
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,210
[ __ ] as elite genetics did back in the

515
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:27,039
day not to be confused liek cannabis

516
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:30,039

517
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,349

00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,369
include smell but you know I can't lower

644
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,650
the price on his seeds if I wanted to

645
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:34,069
and the spray is already not it's not a

huge margin so but the seeds 35% off

personal preference like when people ask

706
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,410
me like what's my best strain when I get

707
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:54,720
those emails I say the first response I

708

give is thank you shaggy yes that that's

709
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:05,368
close enough when people ask me that I

710
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:07,380
like to say let name some strains that

711
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,910
you do like waves are some strange that

712
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,890
you do like that you like to smoke em

713
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:13,469
and they tell me that then I can make a

714
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:17,000
basis off of how certain strains treat

715
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:17,000
their their brain chemistry you know

716
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:24,139
thank you redwood thank you Pacific oh

717
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:30,630

718
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:32,699
last night yet no I always leave that up

719
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:38,608
to brand whenever she finally does the

720
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:40,559
drawing well know who won meth heads let

721
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:41,759
I guess that's next after cokehead [ __ ]

722
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,059
because there is a little bit of a

723
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,720
variance right usually cokehead [ __ ]

724
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:50,949
are

725
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:54,039
rich rich girls or girls from better off

726
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:55,779
situations that that go on bad coke runs

727
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,259
and ended up sucking everyone's dick and

728
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,030
[ __ ] dudes for coke right but meth

729
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,430
hit [ __ ] usually are already white

730
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:06,400
trash and they get into it and they

731
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:08,588
never had a chance so that's usually how

732
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,780
it goes usually you do coke head [ __ ]

733
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:13,449
don't dip down to meth they just stay on

734
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,130
coke or crack but meth head [ __ ] that

735
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:18,460
if they're already on math they're

736
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,619
[ __ ] anyways call it administrative

737
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:25,000
assistant there you go

738
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:32,440
but yeah can you flower under cm h3 yeah

739
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:37,000

740
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:39,329
years go with what type of height I miss

741
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,329

742
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,159

745
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,300
of people were conned into thinking Cara

746

748
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:04,469

749
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:10,599
very well all of them all of them

750
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:13,588

751
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,990
indica sea I say it's boof but my friend

752
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:18,849
up in Canada loves it track inspector

753
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:21,159
loves the [ __ ] Friesland but I just

754
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:24,220
not my thing a lot of it got passed down

755
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,519
here from Canada and it was Canadian be

756
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,519
stirrers

757
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,778
strongest highest yield Lord like just

758
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,079
like all the other questions people are

759
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:50,278
asking it depends on how you grow

760
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,500
depends on your body chemistry

761
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:54,119
what is potent to you might not be

762
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,409
potent to me what's putting me night not

763
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,470
be potent to use that's a really hard

764
00:38:55,409 --> 00:39:00,778
one as far as biggest yielding a lot of

765
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:02,909
the strawberry cream based lines are

766
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:04,949
good yielders however depends on how you

767
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:06,328
grow man I don't like telling people you

768
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:08,159
can get big yields if they suck at

769
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:09,359
growing you know and at the same time I

770
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,068
don't like telling they're gonna get

771
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,578
quality if they suck at growing and make

772
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:16,259
everything beastie yields the last thing

773
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,150
you should be worrying about is yields

774
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:26,910
first thing you should be worried about

775
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:28,980
is quality I still have some of the old

776
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:30,838
dog wanna push from motorable the og

777
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,260
cush arowana I the original seeds of

778
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,940
that I wasn't a fan man wasn't a fan

779
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:40,710
it's not my thing I don't like that

780
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:45,179
leathery smell of marijuana it was not

781
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:54,809
appealing to me um yeah not my thing

782
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:56,759
oh so the next the next a forgetting two

783
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,760
to three pounds of like I mean I it

784
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,410
depends on your growing style again but

785
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,520
I can pull that with blue dream and it's

786
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:04,348
just still wouldn't be that great

787
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:06,630
equality just because you're pushing it

788
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,220
so hard you should never push a strain

789
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,260
you should never use bloom boosters if

790
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:12,719
you want quality because you're you're

791
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:19,140
redirecting the energy of the plant

792
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:20,548
I have not smelled the Harry it smells

793
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:23,519
like peanuts absolutely nice you're

794
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:26,818

796
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:31,608
spray can any of those are [ __ ]

797
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:31,608
stinky is [ __ ] man

798
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,750
quality over quantity any day any day of

799
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:43,590
the week and I don't think most people

800
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:46,230
will ever understand that see and motor

801
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:49,320

803
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,190
horses line however I don't think it was

804
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,400
I think he crossed something in if I

805
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,019
remember correctly if I remember

806
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,240
correctly crossed something different in

807
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,889
and it came out completely different

808
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,839
whereas the original Hera wanna from

809
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:08,099
Steve tough wood horse that that line

810
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,430
was a more of an Afghani base and motor

811
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:12,929
rebels is just like very narrow leaf

812
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:15,409
that's not anything reminiscent of the

813
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,409
original

814
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:31,019
here wanted Jack 33 it sounds like a

815
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:39,000
sandy line there any negative side

816
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:42,300
effects to reversing a plant outside not

817
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,559
really other than I don't outdoor

818
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,280
breeding is not ideal anywhere because

819
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:49,110
cross-contamination becomes a big

820
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,210
reality when you start [ __ ] with [ __ ]

821
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:54,300
outdoors always because you never know

822
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,710
who's growing outdoors around you unless

823
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,390
you know are your neighbors and [ __ ] but

824
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,150
I mean even then pollen can travel over

825
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:02,309
a mile so that's that's the biggest

826
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,990
problem and seeding your neighbors

827
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:07,559
plants because they'll [ __ ] hate you

828
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:08,789
forever if they find out you did that do

829
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,009
you think it's possible there's still a

830
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:13,320
tree cut of UBC Jima oh sure I have a

831
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,120
lot of early UBC chemo crosses still too

832
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,010
but yeah I'm sure the original cuts

833
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:24,210
gotta be out there it was passed around

834
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:25,410
a lot it wasn't too rare again groovy

835
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,360
weed in my line

836
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:30,629
awesome groovy failing it depends on

837
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,000
your body chemistry a lot of people like

838
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,880
herbal because it relaxes them and earth

839
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,969
will freaks me out and makes me question

840
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,450
everything about every decision I've

841
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:45,449
ever made and hate life so it's again

842
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:46,799
it's not something that if someone like

843
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:48,029
if you go in a collective and someone

844
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,590
tells you how this weed is gonna make

845
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,290
you feel they're [ __ ] lying to you

846
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:54,420
that is not how it works and anybody who

847
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:55,650
smokes any amount of weed for any period

848
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,700
of time should be able to figure that

849
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:02,190
out pretty quick I have no idea who

850
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:07,349
garrison Lane is don't know who Billy

851
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:13,500
Kimber og is I don't have a wide lexicon

852
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:16,789
of of new pollen shoppers I apologize I

853
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:19,829
don't keep up with anything like that

854
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:21,210
and even but you know what like even

855
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,529
with friends of mine like someone just

856
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,000
asked about professor P was trained

857
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,500
currently going I have no idea what he's

858
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,300
working on and it's not out of

859
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,400
disrespect for him it's not that I don't

860
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,130
care about his lines I'm working on my

861
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,309
own [ __ ] and it's like I just have my

862
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,430
head down working you know that's how it

863
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,429
goes

864
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:46,440
I've got him longer you've been in the

865
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:48,749
game nice oh thank you uh as far as like

866
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,278
breeding and selling seats publicly it's

867
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:51,719
at 13 years now twelve and a half

868
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:52,798
thirteen years I always eight thirteen

869
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,159
because it sounds cooler but it's more

870
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:58,079
like two and a half as far as growing in

871
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,879
[ __ ] since I was young man since I was

872
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,528
young I mean I even I used to water my

873
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,230
dad's plants that doesn't really count

874
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:10,469
for growing cuz I hated doing it but

875
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:12,179
it's been on and off most of my life you

876
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:15,568
know potency and breeding potential of

877
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:18,778
Neville Hayes Neville Hayes is a

878
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:21,088
beautiful line not every Fino is

879
00:44:18,778 --> 00:44:22,920
beautiful which means that the out

880
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:25,469
crosses are going to be wide and varied

881
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,838
however if some were to take an L line

882
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:30,748
that was extremely good work it keep

883
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,518
selecting towards that line awesome

884
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:37,348
absolutely awesome

885
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:42,088
I just I'm gonna be poppin some new a

886
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:46,798
new sour line as we speak so after the

887
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:48,298
all this [ __ ] goes on just harvested

888
00:44:46,798 --> 00:44:50,579
some of the seeds and they look good

889
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:53,639
there's a lot of potential in the cross

890
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:56,220
however you never know till you run them

891
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:59,518
so those won't be available for quite a

892
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:02,189
while but yeah there's some some legit

893
00:44:59,518 --> 00:45:05,748
sour D crosses going on and it might

894
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:10,079
have something to do with something

895
00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:11,429
something sure B maybe I don't know got

896
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:16,548
to make lines that appeal to everyone

897
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:19,739
and and you know it makes him good [ __ ]

898
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:23,068
yeah you better force him on you better

899
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:24,239
force him on it takes forever to come on

900
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:25,429
last night he came on when I had like

901
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,259
two seconds left

902
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:30,259
old man Lopes needs to come through

903
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,820
do these lessons make you look smart I

904
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:41,950
think they make me look smarter and

905
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:43,869
sexier and sexier what do I do with

906
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:45,399
leftovers after I harvest my seeds I

907
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:49,030
usually throw it in the freezer and

908
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,880
never touch it again but I will be

909
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:55,570
smashing it soon I have a lot of [ __ ] I

910
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,130
need to go through yeah I mean for a

911
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,750
while when I would be low on weed I'd

912
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:03,400
smoke it just because it was good [ __ ]

913
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,989
it just had been seated yeah yeah we

914
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,880
brought that up earlier about sunlight

915
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:09,809
supply and Scots Miracle Grow no real

916
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,760
surprise there no real surprise there

917
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:14,710
the average time to bring the line

918
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,230
public so like if let's say everything

919
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:21,670
lines up correctly let's say I did a

920
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:23,860
good selection the progeny show good

921
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,539
favorable results that like I see [ __ ]

922
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:31,570
that I like and I know other people with

923
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:34,570
like and all that [ __ ] is it

924
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:35,920
lupa had been finicky yeah not too

925
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,930
terribly but I remember the first time I

926
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,849
grew it it was it was a lot I just

927
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:47,618
wasn't as good at growing oh jeez but

928
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:49,779
for a line to be finished respect at

929
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:54,960
least a year year and a half and that's

930
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,960
if everything goes everything goes right

931
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:01,179
do you think effects with taste do you

932
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,358
think affects the taste with fertilized

933
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:10,529
buds I'm not sure if that means I'd have

934
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:13,989
to reword that smart is the new gangsta

935
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:17,440
very true accept it I'll suck you in

936
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:18,939
your [ __ ] mouth - I could recite

937
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,970
cannabis genetics and I'll punch you in

938
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:24,190
your [ __ ] face doesn't mean that I'll

939
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:28,480
beat your ass but I goddamn will [ __ ]

940
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:31,090
try damn well try

941
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,269
I have no edit button with my mouth or

942
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:36,400
my uh or my kicks or punches that's just

943
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:38,230
the way it is but I grew up in a [ __ ]

944
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,300
blue-collar town and I think that's

945
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,800
normal for everyone around here and it's

946
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,619
not normal for people in a lot of other

947
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,990
cities it's we our town even our punk

948
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:47,000
rock

949
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:48,500
we have a horrible reputation for being

950
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,219
violent as a matter of fact there's a

951
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,599
new documentary there's a new

952
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:56,829
documentary coming out what's it called

953
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,569
I think it's called bonza Brundage and

954
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:02,420
they did a documentary on Bakersfield

955
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,710
punk rock and the violence and all the

956
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,170
fucked-up [ __ ] in our scene that's

957
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,970
happened over the years so yeah if you

958
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:12,349
see that coming out check it out the

959
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:13,639
bones of Brundage I'm in it so of course

960
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:16,909
I'm gonna push it because that's [ __ ]

961
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:18,368
ku but yeah it's a it's all about the

962
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:21,259
history of punk rock and Bakersfield

963
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:25,210
which was funny flying swordsman came on

Dead's records on his pages [ __ ]

969
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:38,449

972

976
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,019
different things if you if you want I'll

978
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:05,239
trailer man it's just some of it

979
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:08,170
but you know it's it's a lot about how

980
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:12,319
like during a certain era of Bakersfield

981
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:13,940
the early 2000s late 90s how everyone

982
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,280
that was around during that era

983
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,829
we all knew each other because victory

984
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,690
was not terribly uh it's not terribly

985
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,730
big especially the punk rock scene was

986
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,460
much smaller and we all knew each other

987
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:29,358
and it was kind of about how from this

988
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:31,940
small group what happened and how it all

989
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,679
fell apart and how we all ended up you

990
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,579
know most of us are dead most of our

991
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:39,769
friends are dead or you'll see a lot of

992
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:43,789
them that are homeless in the

993
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:45,108
documentary guys that were frontmen one

994
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:48,139
of the guys that was a frontman of one

995
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:52,340
of my band he's a [ __ ] disaster

996
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:55,069
[ __ ] disaster now he just slurs and

997
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:57,500
mumbles and grumbles and it used to be a

998
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,550
funny dude used to used to be punk as

999
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,280
[ __ ] and now

1000
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:06,260
is a wipeout you know it's a lot about

1001
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:09,620
that yeah not many people made it out

1002
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:13,970
and were successful it was a [ __ ]

1003
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:16,369
wild time it was a good time but you

1004
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:18,559
know I mean everything's awesome when

1005
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:21,529
you're on drugs until drugs take over

1006
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,139
and you're [ __ ] you know you don't you

1007
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:25,760
don't get out of doing hard drugs

1008
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:27,980
untouched it'll affect your life in some

1009
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,750
way it will absolutely affect your safe

1010
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:36,199
and your life in some way

1011
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:38,119
I grow organic and I grow synthetic it's

1012
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,009
a hybrid style of growing and it's just

1013
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,859
whatever works best and the most

1014
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,750
effective and I find that not being

1015
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,150
strictly one thing or another being able

1016
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,920
to move fluid you know with what you got

1017
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:52,039
and being able to move fluid based on

1018
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:55,789
the strain is is the best way for me to

1019
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:57,050
grow I can adapt to all of it and that's

1020
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:59,480
that's what works best for me

1021
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,920
I see people kick my ass and growing

1022
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,949
with organic and I've seen people kick

1023
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,300
my ass with growing in synthetic

1024
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:09,259
definitely not the best but but it's all

1025
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:11,060
about being fluid yep lots of heroin at

1026
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,190
the pump scene I've been through it

1027
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:16,400
lived it somehow I made it out the other

1028
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:19,400
end though I'm pretty vocal about it

1029
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,769
like I don't care I like to be able to

1030
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,260
talk about my past when it comes to all

1031
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:25,309
drugs because I know a lot of other

1032
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,530
people have been through what I've been

1033
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:30,500
through and in cannabis people are so

1034
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:32,210
[ __ ] judgmental so goddamn judgmental

1035
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,889
and people should be able to talk about

1036
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:36,800
their experiences be able to relate with

1037
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:37,940
people too and and you should be able to

1038
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,980
inspire people who are going through

1039
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,510
that [ __ ] you know what I mean you'll be

1040
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:43,849
able to talk you know say I made it

1041
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:46,160
through this you can too that's it

1042
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:48,529
sounds silly and it sounds obvious but

1043
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,049
it's not in our scene and in even though

1044
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,430
cannabis whether people ever want to I

1045
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,260
don't know why people say it's not a

1046
00:51:52,429 --> 00:51:56,000
drug it's a [ __ ] drug alcohol is a

1047
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,660
drug anything that alters your mind

1048
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,849
state is a drug you know it is what it

1049
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:05,599
is I'm not saying one is worse than the

1050
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:07,789
other obviously some are worse than the

1051
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,179
other but I don't think cannabis is the

1052
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:12,440
worst by any means but it is a drug so

1053
00:52:11,179 --> 00:52:13,879
for people to be so judge

1054
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,608
mental about other people and the lives

1055
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,269
they're living or lived when they smoke

1056
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:22,460
pot that's so ironic so ironic

1057
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:23,568
and to this day dude like when people

1058
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,068
want to insult me they'll call me a

1059
00:52:23,568 --> 00:52:27,559
[ __ ] junkie because they know that's

1060
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:29,568
my past and the the quickest way to

1061
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,509
insult someone that's ever had a really

1062
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:34,429
bad drug past is to call them a current

1063
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,410
junkie and it's real easy to do that

1064
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:38,690
it's real easy to insult people like

1065
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:40,338
that but I don't get hurt by it um

1066
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,750
because I've seen the good that it's

1067
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:43,369
done by me talking about my past with

1068
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,588
heroin and methadone and all that [ __ ]

1069
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:47,660
and I've seen how many people pop up and

1070
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:48,469
you know what message me say me too me

1071
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:50,989
too

1072
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:52,189
I think you know so that's all the

1073
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:54,379
reason I bring it up that's all the

1074
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,599
reason I talk about it because people

1075
00:52:54,380 --> 00:53:01,539
should be able to talk about their [ __ ]

1076
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:03,349
you know without feeling [ __ ] just I

1077
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:07,210
don't know like without having their

1078
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:07,210
reputations tarnished by everyone else

1079
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:12,368
plus drugs are [ __ ] fun right

1080
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:28,710
hashtag me too me too movement yeah I

1081
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:31,650
was a horrible drunk when I was young at

1082
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:34,159
the age of 19 I had my liver fill and

1083
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,389
had to be rushed the hospital and

1084
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,159
whatever toxins were coming through from

1085
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:40,559
the alcohol infected a lymph node my

1086
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:43,529
lymph system and I had to be cut open

1087
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,779
and have my lymph nodes drained and be

1088
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:49,230
stuffed with gauze and pulled the Goss

1089
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:52,019
out of myself six feet of it twice a day

1090
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:54,088
for months until it finally killed

1091
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:56,670
wasn't sealed itself up so you know I've

1092
00:53:54,088 --> 00:54:01,818
been there too do you I consider myself

1093
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:05,280
a grower or breeder first um a grower

1094
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:08,190
because you cannot be a breeder if

1095
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:12,480
you're not a an excellent grower you

1096
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:14,250

1100
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,310
grower before you can advance to

1101
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:25,079
breeding it's just you can't you can't

1102
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:27,389
see lines fully express themselves if

1103
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:31,130

00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:31,529
rooms are too much for me I start

1122
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,389
giggling a lot at the beginning but then

1123
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,370
it always ends up being a bad drop at

1124
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:38,210
the end always really depressing at the

1125
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:38,210
end so yeah

1126
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,559
Jesus same answer I've been given to all

1127
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:48,179
this [ __ ] man it just depends you have

1128
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,279
to you would have to try each one see

1129
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,440
what worked better for your chronic pain

1130
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,840
again you got to realize smoking affects

1131
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,450
your into a cannabinoid system along

1132
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,490
with all there's many receptors that it

1133
00:55:57,449 --> 00:56:02,460
that affects some of these are pain

1134
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,719
receptors some different strains even

1135
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,849
different phenotypes of each strain

1136
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:11,339
effect different pain receptors

1137
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:16,650
differently in everyone I didn't do

1138
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:25,910
gzhel crossed the afghani heirloom line

1139
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:25,910
I did do Jesus our dub and gzhel s ones

1140
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:34,860
that's crazy the bugs in the plant yeah

1141
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,860
that would [ __ ] me up too

1142
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,360
again which trains have no narcotic

1143
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:51,670
effect it's not known unless it happens

1144
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:53,530
to you because I mean again purple has a

1145
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:55,900
narcotic effect on most people on me

1146
00:56:53,530 --> 00:57:09,130
it's not necessarily narcotic it's a bad

1147
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:10,960
bad situation these glasses is hip I did

1148
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:14,800
not create gzhel that was created by

1149
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,780
chem dog the person not the strain the

1150
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,250
strain well the person named himself

1151
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,620
after the strain because that's a strain

1152
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,659
