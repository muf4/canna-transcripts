scene researching everything from

24
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,698

written by corporations and others who

35
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,879

for here yeah I can tell well and like

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,379
from the type of political activities

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,900
you've gotten yourself into and and the

68
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:36,120
The Works you do for social change it's

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,039
it's very very humbling to watch from

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
from a person you know way over here

71
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,479
it's what I'd love to be doing so mad

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
props tell me a little bit about zomia

73
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,818
tell me tell me what zomia is in the

74
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,899
first place

75
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:51,419
a collective

76
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,819
um it's uh it's a project that's working

77
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,878
on long-term land race conservation in

78
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,318
Southeast Asia but fundamentally it's

79
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,639
much more than that it's a social

80
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,799
movement

81
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,199
um it's a concept in political

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,060
philosophy and anthropology

83
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,098
um that's sort of grounded in an

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,878
understanding of the indigenous people

85
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:14,419
of the Hill tracks of Southeast Asia

86
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:17,399
it's a sort of non-jurisdictional entity

87
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:18,539
which comprises about a hundred million

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,459
people

89
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,060
um speaking you know so many different

90
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,120
languages all of whom are united in a

91
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,239
sort of a refusal to partake in the

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,000
state in paying taxes in you know being

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,739
conscripted and instead uh you know live

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,039
in the in the Hills away from everybody

95
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,280
else one of the things that unites the

96
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,318
region is the choice of crops namely

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,180
cannabis and so

98
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,158
um with a foundation in political

99
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,819
activism which we can get it into if you

100
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:55,439
want a sort of nucleus of of of cannabis

101
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:57,439
breeders Growers

102
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,019
Village elders and tribal communities

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,658
formed into yeah a collective uh with

104
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,700
this purpose of preservation the land

105
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:08,699
race uh cannabis in Southeast Asia

106
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,079
perhaps even Beyond that's amazing um

107
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,539
can you tell me what kind of pushed you

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,640
in this direction

109
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:16,680
where did you grow up what got you into

110
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,759
the southeast Asia climate stuff like

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,180
that

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,879
sure uh personally I'm I'm back I'm from

113
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,459
The Basque country but I grew up in

114
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,500
Scotland and that was kind of where me

115
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,478
and Matthew were talking uh kind of a

116
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,540
little bit the the sort of Trainspotting

117
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,639
uh style of things you know we were

118
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,060
buying cannabis from pretty sketchy

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,220
places from a pretty young age and

120
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,620
I mean for those who know you you know

121
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,080
what the scene's all about and

122
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,699
when you catch that bug and especially

123
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,978
for us we were really lucky to get stuff

124
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,919
like gold stamped Mazar

125
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,478
um you know Goldfield like black Afghan

126
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,120
um despite being you know in a really

127
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,459
Northern remote location we did benefit

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,340
from some of the sort of uh the the

129
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,560
small scale Smugglers before the the war

130
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,198
on terror and the changes in the

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,040
airports you know sort of killed that

132
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,419
and from then it was you know at 16 I

133
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,080
came out to

134
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:19,139
to to India and then to Southeast Asia

135
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,219
and ended up never never leaving

136
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,259
um you know a lot of my formative

137
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,240
experiences were there

138
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,520
um I fell into the into the wine

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,220
industry strangely enough as a sort of

140
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,019
you know francophone in Southeast Asia

141
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,500
right

142
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,899
um but you know there's this kind of uh

143
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,839
there's this I guess this racism I

144
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,159
suppose where where the or internalized

145
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,258
racism I don't know what how you want to

146
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,560
describe it but there's the need for

147
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,720
like a token french guy to sell wine

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,280
um in the fancy restaurants and it

149
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
doesn't matter whether he's Basque or

150
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,138
actually French or not you know close

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,319
enough you know yeah right and so

152
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,418
I as a lover of you know good taste and

153
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,740
piano and everything else I've always

154
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,319
had a bit of chip on my shoulder about

155
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,900
good food sort of being so expensive and

156
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,519
you know this was my way to to to be

157
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,560
able to taste what I wanted to Taste and

158
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,439
to talk with chefs and that kind of

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,478
stuff and it was great but I also it was

160
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,639
great it was also terrible and I got

161
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:21,180
very disillusioned and so when the

162
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,600
opportunity to sort of bring the

163
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,180
the structure of

164
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,580
in particular to the Cannabis world came

165
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,759
about I jumped on it because it was you

166
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,079
know the the culmination and honestly 16

167
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,560
year old me wouldn't have believed it

168
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,198
you know it's just a dream country right

169
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,079
yeah absolutely and so

170
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,080
um basically lucky enough to be working

171
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,639
in in restaurants with a budget high

172
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,839
enough to pay for traveling in terms of

173
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,600
r d and pre-covered a lot of traveling

174
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,060
you know looking for indigenous or

175
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,220
traditional fermented beverages for for

176
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,100
food pairings

177
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,900
um let us let me in my team

178
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,819
um to be in contact with a lot of

179
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,879
communities who are also growing Canada

180
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,560
and in the course of you know spending

181
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,478
time in these communities learning how

182
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,300
they ferment different grains and

183
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,478
cereals pulses Etc into into alcohol and

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,220
drinks the opportunity came about to to

185
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,680
to sort of learn more about the land

186
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,120
race cannabis and it was very nicely

187
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,038
timed

188
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,939
um a few years before the legalization

189
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:33,300
in Thailand which gave a little bit more

190
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:35,579
confidence to us and to others to be

191
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,500
able to sort of open up because as I'm

192
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,079
sure a lot of you are aware the panels

193
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,639
disease for you know engaging in

194
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,439
anything kind of isolated in Thailand

195
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,918
before legalization where we're very

196
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,560
very severe yeah so it was yeah it was

197
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:53,579
really about it was about timing and

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,360
about passion I guess and about a lot of

199
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,800
like-minded individuals with you know a

200
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,020
singular Target I guess

201
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
um and that Target again being the

202
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,620
conservation of of land races and I

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,478
think it's a subject which is pretty

204
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,360
easy to be passionate about you know so

205
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,779
it's a substance there's stories there's

206
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,038
so much to it yeah there's a lot to it

207
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,359
um when you were talking about like

208
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,719
going into the communities and looking

209
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,240
up fermented uh different fermented

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,680
drinks that's fascinating man like what

211
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,560
yeah can you give us an example like

212
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,840
bang is that like do they make fermented

213
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,519
bang and stuff like that

214
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,859
um well I you know I've actually never

215
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,299
seen uh fermented bang

216
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,180
um it's not definitely not out of the

217
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,278
bounds of the imagination no you know we

218
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,559
we're looking at doing in this

219
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:44,820
particular context sort of pre-colonial

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,518
Indian and Thai recipes and wandering at

221
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,899
our intellectual dishonesty at charging

222
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,639
really high prices for French wine

223
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,639
pairings with that you know yeah yeah of

224
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,919
course and so it was a matter of yeah

225
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,299
trying to find you know different sort

226
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,039
of unique things which we could bring

227
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,958
that value element to the to the

228
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,659
customer to the person consuming the

229
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,879
beverage of your complex drink with a

230
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:07,199
good taste and a story there's quite a

231
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,299
lot of them around but unfortunately we

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,019
don't really find them so much in the

233
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:15,359
big sort of urban city context where a

234
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,220
bank might be consumed you know and bang

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,259
is a regulated good so it's sold in the

236
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,200
government shops you can find it outside

237
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,399
of course but uh primarily it at least I

238
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,680
associate it with a bit more of an urban

239
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,860
context whereas the drinks we were more

240
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,719
in tatiskar and jharkhand in orisa in

241
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,159
the tribal regions

242
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,540
um you know mostly grains rice

243
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,819
one of my favorites in Thailand is

244
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,399
called Sato there's different forms but

245
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,160
essentially it's a glutenous rice with a

246
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,379
little yeast cake called lupang which is

247
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,439
made from a bunch of different local

248
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:52,860
herbs and essentially you get a little

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,500
clay pot and you add your your rice and

250
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,639
then your your lupang and your water you

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,200
fill it up with a little bit of water

252
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,899
and then you seal it off the top of the

253
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,000
jar is filled off with clay and that'll

254
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,639
be left for a few days and you can just

255
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,259
first uh there's like a bamboo straw you

256
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,000
burst the clay seal and you just pop it

257
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,720
straight in and drink right out of it

258
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,080
and it's

259
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,259
got the most wonderful like sour uh

260
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,940
funky fermentation Aroma frankly

261
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,799
um and you know that provided a really

262
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,839
solid base efficient experiment with

263
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,819
infusing different you know flavors into

264
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,019
it making it sparkling that kind of

265
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,740
thing

266
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,899
um you know I mean the the equivalent of

267
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,519
you know a really expensive wine if it's

268
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,740
something going to be like you know

269
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,379
traditional there's a lot of racism in

270
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,060
the world of food and it was Thai food

271
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:42,360
Indian food is very often looked down

272
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:44,039
upon and so for it to sort of be valued

273
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,839
as an equivalent by something like a

274
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,319
Michelin inspector it needs to really be

275
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,399
sort of yeah yeah I bet

276
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,360
so as a sommelier did you guys uh did a

277
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,740
lot of the experience with like

278
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,000
chirpings and stuff cross over into

279
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,000
cannabis

280
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,139
yeah at the end in my last job that was

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,139
something that we were playing with

282
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,539
quite a lot the last two jobs actually

283
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,759
um I was uh I was the beverage director

284
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,559
for a group which included some cocktail

285
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,720
bars and a couple of restaurants in

286
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,119
Bangkok and they were very sort of

287
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,240
progressive and open-minded one of the

288
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,879
owners smoked a lot of weight

289
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,159
um and so it was a little bit easier to

290
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,720
sort of Swing those things however we

291
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,399
weren't able to actually roll it out in

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,980
the dining room because it was before

293
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,778
the legalization yeah and despite you

294
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,639
know terpenes not having any cannabis

295
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,139
it's not the sort of attention that any

296
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,000
sort of restaurant was looking for at

297
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,778
that time um but we were playing with it

298
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
because

299
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,320
you know apart from the fermented

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,120
beverages they're talking about they

301
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
have alcohol in them and there's a lot

302
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,940
of people who don't consume alcohol in

303
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,799
Asia and so

304
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,680
um we were looking yeah much more at

305
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,479
doing stuff with tea uh Botanicals of

306
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,578
which you know terpenes

307
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,539
um key component in almost any that you

308
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,819
look at

309
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:00,059
and so as a stoner I'm always interested

310
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,278
in sort of you know finding some OG Kush

311
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,500
taste and some mad tea from somewhere or

312
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,019
something like that you know yeah of

313
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,578
course as you got into the Asia

314
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,220
political sphere and you started making

315
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:14,159
these connections and inroads what got

316
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,320
you then to move from maybe

317
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,480
um as much of a preservation of Thailand

318
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,940
races which was really you know the main

319
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
starting goal into working with the

320
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,839
farmers and making sure the farmers are

321
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,759
absolutely taken care of

322
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,260
I see those two things as absolutely

323
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,259
synonymous that's beautiful

324
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
um yeah I mean I I can go in more into

325
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,699
detail if you'd like but please do well

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,919
there's a lot of conservation

327
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,860
um I see people tagging their indoor

328
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:48,240
grows as preservation runs

329
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,879
um you know and the thing with zoos is

330
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,159
that they're pretty big entities that

331
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,278
require a lot of coordination and moving

332
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,319
parts and until the Advent of pretty

333
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:01,200
strict regulations

334
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,300
um and even despite that they can be

335
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,360
pretty dark places

336
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:10,379
um and so

337
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,500
when I think of exit to conservation I

338
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:15,419
think of yeah little amateur zoos

339
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,320
um it's a noble effort but ultimately

340
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,399
the only people who can grow

341
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,680
significant populations of open

342
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
pollinated cannabis

343
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,759
um from Land race genetics

344
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,980
is people in the traditional land race

345
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,259
growing regions I mean they don't have

346
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,778
to contend or at least for now with all

347
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,539
of the licenses that's needed in in the

348
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:38,879
west or in North America and Europe

349
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,259
um they don't need to contend at least

350
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,778
until recently they didn't need to

351
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,240
contend with hemp Farms or contamination

352
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:47,820
those kinds of things and so

353
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,379
I'm hesitant to say that no preservation

354
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,139
can be done outside because I think it's

355
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:55,799
pretty obvious that it can but at this

356
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,419
point the focus seems to be so much on

357
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,759
um getting seeds out of the traditional

358
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,699
growing regions and into cryogenic

359
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,980
storage or into long-term you know

360
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,800
growing facilities and there's not much

361
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,720
thought going into actually just helping

362
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,699
out the farmers who are growing land

363
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,620
races in the traditional growing region

364
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,839
and keeping them growing these

365
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,259
traditional yeah like yeah they're

366
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,180
already doing it like

367
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,259
a lot of places including in Thailand

368
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,059
um people are coming all over and

369
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,559
they're like oh well listen like we need

370
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,119
to teach these guys how to be more

371
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,919
profitable so they can sort of keep up

372
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,539
with the modern industry blah blah blah

373
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,479
blah this is not the solution answer

374
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:36,360
sorry this is not a solution either yeah

375
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,459
um by modernizing and changing either

376
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,278
the target of their grow for example

377
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:43,739
that move away from tariffs to trisift

378
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,078
and bubble hashes and Parvati and other

379
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,820
places this changes the way that the

380
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,500
selections are made and despite being

381
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,180
maybe quite subtle

382
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,458
um they have long lasting consequences

383
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,979
you know and so ultimately we'd be

384
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:59,638
looking at providing essentially a

385
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,800
subsidy for Growers that are growing a

386
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,320
product which unfortunately is not

387
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,240
profitable in the modern Marketplace but

388
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,879
has significant value for the community

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,039
and Industry as a whole yeah

390
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,078
um and you know giving them that

391
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,179
incentive to make the choice to grow

392
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,278
these land races despite the

393
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,698
disadvantages that are you know created

394
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,559
by legislation policy Etc

395
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:24,539
um you know because ultimately everybody

396
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,299
has families to take care of and you

397
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,519
know wants to eat and so when faced with

398
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:31,319
a choice of or not necessarily the

399
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,100
choice when faced with having a

400
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,079
long-standing land race grow

401
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,240
no more customers and knowing that all

402
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,159
it would take is to switch to a modern

403
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,019
cultivar for your Market to suddenly

404
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,879
open up you know that's that's a choice

405
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,320
which almost every land race farmer is

406
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,278
facing today and we need to give them a

407
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,260
reason to

408
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,179
if you like hybrids let's you know keep

409
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,799
doing what we're doing

410
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,179
um yeah it kind of reminds me a little

411
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,539
bit of The multi-state Operators

412
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,439
dropping the prices you know below

413
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,740
um

414
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,420
a sustainable uh you know price yeah for

415
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,539
producing yeah because they can afford

416
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:09,979
to sustain that and take that loss

417
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,980
yeah exactly so it kind of feels like

418
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,078
everybody sort of

419
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,940
really what they have but nobody's

420
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,919
really willing to actually hook them up

421
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,660
or even able really to buy their

422
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,399
products and so it's just kind of going

423
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:23,360
to disappear in the meantime and that's

424
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,399
what we hope hope to address and to to

425
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,800
redress and so what we do essentially is

426
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,899
we approach the it depends who we're

427
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,838
approaching and when but if we can we're

428
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,399
approaching the the community as a whole

429
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,220
um the the village elder or Village

430
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,539
Chief or whatever the equivalent is and

431
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,540
you know coming up with some sort of

432
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:45,000
agreement for them to continue growing

433
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,399
land races and for us to to make an

434
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,078
attempt uh you know offering their

435
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,059
germplasm

436
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:55,620
um and seeds to to the International

437
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:58,319
Community with for which to breed with

438
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,480
um the idea is that you know people back

439
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,000
home don't need to be concerned with

440
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,400
conservation if we actually let the pros

441
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,019
take care of it in a way and then they

442
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,839
can have fun creating all the crazy

443
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,418
hybrids from the final hunt which can be

444
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,159
done each year in such a of you know

445
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,500
genetically diverse population right

446
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,259
yeah

447
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,519
um yeah so that's the way we see it

448
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,619
that's amazing man

449
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,418
um the whole the whole way that you

450
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,458
approach it is very I don't know just

451
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,020
socially conscious to me and I and it's

452
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,220
something that's been lacking a lot in

453
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,660
cannabis

454
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,140
um I think a lot of people that I've

455
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,000
I've seen over the years tend to maybe I

456
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,620
don't want to say exploit the farmers

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,240
but it's hard to say anything other than

458
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,219
that because they try to get the

459
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,319
cheapest absolute price so that they can

460
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,640
then take a cut off the seeds over the

461
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,099
top and that's how they make their money

462
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,200
you know but back it all goes back to

463
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,939
what is the incentive for the farmers to

464
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,580
keep growing these when people come to

465
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,400
them like uh without using any names

466
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:58,319
like a big Seed Company you know from

467
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,298
Amsterdam that says hey we'd rather you

468
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,099
have you you know you give us your land

469
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:03,538
races we'll store these in germ play you

470
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,639
can grow some of these feminized seeds

471
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:08,819
in the meantime you know like this is

472
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,580
how this is how things disappear for

473
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,558
good and uh I appreciate your work on it

474
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,199
hey look I mean I I don't think that

475
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,058
we're going to be able to to prevent the

476
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,759
laundry is going extinct unfortunately

477
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,019
but we'll definitely do what we can with

478
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,298
you know the communities that are

479
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,058
willing to work with us to to try and

480
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:28,980
keep what we can for as long as we can

481
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,779
but ultimately it's going to require a

482
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,160
concerted effort on behalf of the entire

483
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,619
Community

484
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,700
um ultimately there needs to be a demand

485
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,798
for tehua driven products and a clear

486
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,500
understanding of what theof driven

487
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,179
products are ultimately I think a lot of

488
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,419
people they want to have that experience

489
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:50,640
of the Colombian gold or the Thai stick

490
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,500
that they had back in the day and you

491
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,020
know that was all imported cannabis and

492
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,000
so if we want to return to experiences

493
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,639
like that we need to consider a

494
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,038
normalization of trade since that's so

495
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,900
so far away it seems to make sense to

496
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,519
support the little and race growers in

497
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,840
the meantime by breeding with their

498
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,019
genetics

499
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,519
so let's define land race as you see it

500
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,099
as you understand it because that's

501
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,160
super important

502
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:19,019
you know I I I hate to do that actually

503
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,759
because

504
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,839
um but I don't hate to do it but I just

505
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,599
think that

506
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,418
um there's a lot of uh opinions and a

507
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,639
lot of oh sure words out there

508
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,100
um I don't see why we need to reinvent

509
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,840
the wheel every time you know like it's

510
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,439
my take

511
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,500
um is not as as interesting or I think

512
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,940
um as accurate as the numerous studies

513
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,319
which have been published over the last

514
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,240
few decades

515
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,839
um you know dealing with land races and

516
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,679
also specifically defining land races so

517
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,959
um

518
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,820
I would say that um I can't actually

519
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,980
remember the name of the authors of the

520
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:59,700
paper right now there's a paper called

521
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,140
towards an evolved concept of land races

522
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,019
which

523
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,700
um basically

524
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:08,519
it's looking at the history of the

525
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,919
definition of the term and making a

526
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:14,400
proposal that land races should be

527
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,799
considered as basically in Dynamic

528
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,900
populations

529
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:21,058
which can be subjected to introgression

530
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,460
while still retaining their designation

531
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,619
as land races interesting and that's

532
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,679
important because the earliest

533
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:33,119
definitions of land race Von grumker for

534
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,660
example but even you know until seven

535
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,359
which I think was 1998

536
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:43,320
were much more about static

537
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:46,319
um you know the land races uh monolithic

538
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:49,079
uh never changing thing right yeah and

539
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,058
if it becomes polluted it's gone and if

540
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,220
that's the case then they're destined

541
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:54,538
for the museum and they'll never you

542
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,038
know that's not my that's a quote from

543
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,298
the paper you know they'll yeah you'll

544
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,859
never get out

545
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,660
so

546
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,399
in one sense that makes a lot of sense

547
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,580
on one side that makes a lot of sense to

548
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,820
me on the other I think that the

549
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:11,399
implication of this sort of evolved

550
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:13,200
understanding of land races

551
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,780
um is

552
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,519
is underlined by a world view or sorry

553
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,700
maybe sort of a structured by a

554
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,918
worldview which cannot consider a future

555
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,460
where indigenous people might be sort of

556
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,860
left in peace to grow alone you know

557
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,900
like the paper can't even consider that

558
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,038
which bothers me fundamentally because

559
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,620
as

560
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,720
a naive dreamer I suppose I'd like to

561
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:39,538
imagine a future where you know

562
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,400
everybody could be left alone yeah

563
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:44,158
I suppose that is somewhat unrealistic

564
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,259
so you know given the context the

565
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,740
capitalism will continue to expand into

566
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:52,079
every single possible Market that it can

567
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,759
land race cannabis in traditional

568
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,899
growing regions far away from the

569
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,519
nearest road to City no exception

570
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,440
um you know if that's the case then then

571
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,759
I think that that paper does make a lot

572
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,419
of sense

573
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,558
um if we if we are going to integrate

574
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:10,559
these communities into the global

575
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,158
economy and their crops into the global

576
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:16,678
economy as Commodities then certainly

577
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:21,659
there needs to be some sort of uh

578
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:24,179
new look at how we Define land races

579
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,340
yeah I would basically say yeah go go

580
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:29,280
read the studies don't listen to me like

581
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,079
I've got nothing fresh to say on the

582
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,000
definition of land races you know I'm a

583
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,220
bit boring on that I'm happy to defer to

584
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,140
the to the scientists but that's a great

585
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,720
answer because you know some people will

586
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,159
insert their their opinions as facts

587
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,679
state it very confidently and that's

588
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,240
that you know and and the real answer is

589
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,500
man you just gotta do let's check out

590
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,720
the research and stay up to date with

591
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,220
the research right yeah yeah because

592
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,538
it's changing you know and it has

593
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,900
changed

594
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:57,119
um and the way we interpret the study

595
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,980
ourselves you know the I read it you

596
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,418
read it and somehow we come up with two

597
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,000
slightly different conclusions you know

598
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,740
so I would rather instead of um because

599
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,519
I see that something that's happening a

600
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,079
lot

601
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,298
um I'm constantly having these

602
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,859
conversations and I feel like instead of

603
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,779
constantly Reinventing the wheel and

604
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,979
giving our opinions as to what the

605
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,480
definitions of these things are we

606
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,460
should maybe be doing more reading as a

607
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,919
community and and seeing what you know

608
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,360
the biologists have to say about land

609
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,360
races because there's a lot of work done

610
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,979
for corn land races for weeds Etc yeah

611
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,319
um and despite the fact that there's

612
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,839
very few cannabis specific studies

613
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,839
there's a lot of studies on similar

614
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:35,759
organisms on hops Etc you know we can

615
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,439
learn a lot from yeah

616
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,779
so people that are watching this

617
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,220
probably one of the reasons they're

618
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,740
going to come to watch a show about

619
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,558
Thailand races and and we talked about

620
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,599
this yesterday what is the chocolate tie

621
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,359
it's always the first question I get um

622
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,000
I've worked with a line called chocolate

623
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,279
tie from a dude named Dro who supposedly

624
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,019
sourced it from the people that DNA down

625
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,359
in there and sourced it from to make

626
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,179
chocolate back in the day there's of

627
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:07,259
course all these fantastic Legends and

628
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:11,460
fables of Pasa dipped you know heroin

629
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:13,259
infused cannabis there's all these Tales

630
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,940
of what chocolate Thai is in your

631
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,599
experience what have you learned about

632
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,600
chocolate pie

633
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,099
um very very little and I think that's

634
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:26,220
the the message here is that

635
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:29,099
um in Thailand the area which produced

636
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,079
cannabis the largest area isan

637
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:34,500
um was incredibly like really really

638
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,658
poor until quite recently and the idea

639
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,298
that farmers were sort of walking around

640
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,760
eating Nestle chocolate and naming

641
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:43,259
things I mean not saying that no one had

642
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,640
ever heard of chocolate in Nissan in the

643
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:49,679
70s but it's an English word and it's in

644
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,500
my opinion a pretty sort of pretty

645
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,259
clearly it's foreigners who you know had

646
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,619
some accession or selection

647
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:00,179
um or bags of weed with some seeds in it

648
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,759
you know

649
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,380
um and they had you know a chocolate I

650
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,298
really because I really can't speak on

651
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,760
DNA or anything like that at all I can

652
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:11,038
think of is you know having gone through

653
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,379
the motions myself asking pretty much

654
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,298
everybody that I can you know to deal

655
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,280
with chocolate Thai and you know being

656
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:18,359
met with the same thing one issue is

657
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,859
that

658
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,339
um a lot of the traditional knowledge

659
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:25,619
here in Thailand has sort of slowly been

660
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,599
sort of dissipating and becoming

661
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:29,579
unstructured and a lot of the youngins

662
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,558
are learning from the same sources that

663
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:34,319
we are and so you'll meet some

664
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:36,899
especially ethnic pie like they'll be

665
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,178
maybe aware of chocolate Thai and maybe

666
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,100
if you rocked up to Thailand and a few

667
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,298
years ago and you asked for it you would

668
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,439
have got something and they would have

669
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:45,240
told you it was chocolate pie I don't

670
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,558
know

671
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,419
um I can't speak for anything like that

672
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,000
but what I can say is that as far as

673
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,380
large open pollinated populations of

674
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,599
cannabis that we could describe as land

675
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,820
race that the farmers are sort of

676
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,038
engaging with and in their head

677
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,379
conceiving of as chocolate Thai that

678
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,298
doesn't exist as far as unaware of

679
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,980
um what I can say though

680
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,980
um to give people some some hope yeah

681
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:16,200
exactly exactly is that the

682
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,640
the aroma of chocolate also that of

683
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:23,460
coffee dark earthy musty Aromas are very

684
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,440
typical of narrow Leaf drug type land

685
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,019
race when it's been subjected to

686
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,980
compression curing which I think a lot

687
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:35,158
of you will know is Thai sticks and so

688
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,500
um I guess when you have this sort of

689
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,520
um this mechanical pressure plus

690
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,819
temperature plus time we see significant

691
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:48,000
impact on the terpene profiles when we

692
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,220
can add anaerobic conditions on occasion

693
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,759
aging underground or these days in

694
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,558
vacuum seals we do see some pretty funky

695
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,319
Aromas coming out of it but one thing

696
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:01,200
that's quite consistent is sort of

697
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,058
earthy chocolatey character

698
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,120
um that's something that I've I've had a

699
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:08,339
lot in my time in Southeast Asia in Laos

700
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:11,158
in Cambodia and Myanmar and elsewhere

701
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,678
with the older you know six month plus

702
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,480
Europe staff and so

703
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,860
I don't want to speculate too much but I

704
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,839
think it would be interesting if it

705
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,099
turned out to be some sort of uh you

706
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,379
know terpene

707
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,240
um which which was sort of uh maybe bio

708
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,700
synthesized

709
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,679
um during this aging process

710
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,019
um and you know was leading to that it

711
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,640
could also be a combination of different

712
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,619
compounds which are leading to this

713
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,538
smell but uh yeah there's definitely

714
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,339
something to to research there and I

715
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,679
think for those interested in the

716
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:43,558
chocolate pie your best bet is the final

717
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,000
hunt the the Lao isanjinku

718
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,700
um and so for that you can approach

719
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,380
squirrel tail Tiger Tail Thai mango

720
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,240
snake teeth

721
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,679
um a bunch of other stuff

722
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,179
um and you know you'll find pretty

723
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,620
consistently you know applying these

724
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,419
compassion curing techniques that you'll

725
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:58,739
have these chocolate Aromas they're

726
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,299
delicious by the way

727
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,538
um if you nail it you're looking at a

728
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,918
slow degradation of the chlorophyll

729
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:07,099
leaving almost everything else intact

730
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,020
and so you've got a very smooth smoke

731
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:12,000
which doesn't have this sort of Full

732
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,099
Green character which chlorophyll brings

733
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,259
which is so ubiquitous the smoking

734
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:19,379
cannabis flower and I'll say as a note

735
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:21,720
that um you know just as sort of

736
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,700
curiosity a couple times we've had some

737
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,159
some professional summaries coming into

738
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,860
our we're partnered with a dispensary in

739
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,679
Bangkok and they have a total of 64

740
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,839
trains in the in the in the shop front

741
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,460
now and we let all the Somalia smell

742
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,439
them and they're like yeah next next

743
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,600
next next next they get to the

744
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,659
compression cured Lao gold land race and

745
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,038
they're like oh what's this because it's

746
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,080
the only one that doesn't smell green

747
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,359
yeah and doesn't have that chlorophyll

748
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,220
and then wine green is an aroma that's

749
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:54,298
very sort of uh we

750
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:57,240
yeah it's viewed as a flaw almost yeah

751
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:58,619
almost universally and so yeah I think

752
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,058
that there's there's something to be

753
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,819
explored there and I think that there's

754
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:05,519
a reason why so many people are in love

755
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,558
with this chocolate high with the myth

756
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,759
of it with the story because there is

757
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,278
something there that's you know

758
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,500
rewarding delicious

759
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,919
um I just don't think it's a strain

760
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,480
Australian it's proper yeah yeah yeah I

761
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:23,159
know what's interesting is growing up

762
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,620
here and in in the 90s earlier 90s uh

763
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,799
getting a lot of Mexican compressed

764
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,479
brick constant and in that Mexican

765
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,519
compressed brick I've always said it

766
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,399
smelled like minty chocolate but

767
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,440
definitely a cocoa type smell and I

768
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,500
would I mean it was compression

769
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,940
cured and sat forever so it it kind of

770
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,119
you know speaks to what you're talking

771
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,460
about very very very interesting

772
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:51,418
um you mentioned of course the the

773
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,100
infamous Tiger Tail squirrel tail can we

774
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,740
start talking about some of these

775
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,658
different uh what you would call like

776
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,339
maybe an expression of these different

777
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,539
land races or yeah yeah sure so

778
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,480
um

779
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:08,220
it's gotten really confusing and that's

780
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,159
the picture that I'm trying to paint

781
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,720
yeah um the way I'm explaining it it's

782
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,399
probably going to be a bit confused and

783
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,538
what I'm explaining is very confusing

784
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,219
yeah

785
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:20,278
um essentially

786
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,740
the first attestation to the word

787
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:26,038
squirrel tail in the Lao script

788
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,099
um that we saw was in reference to

789
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:32,158
um traditional Kip weaving which is a

790
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:34,199
style or a squirrel tail is a pattern

791
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,320
found in traditional kit weaving which

792
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,840
today is practiced in silk and I think

793
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,778
one day I'd like to find if I can a

794
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:45,058
traditional Thai fist or you know a

795
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:47,038
weaving historian if that exists oh

796
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,798
right did they did they make it with

797
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,440
hemp because that would be my interest

798
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:54,418
to be a hunch right I mean squirrel tail

799
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,880
the Tiger Tail

800
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,500
um these are many things

801
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,120
um it's

802
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:06,058
all down to the the Lao isan we can call

803
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,918
it so on both sides of the Mekong in

804
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:10,200
Thailand and Laos

805
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,960
um live flower speakers in the Thai side

806
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,600
it's referred to as a region as isan or

807
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,340
the Cora plateau and

808
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,459
essentially

809
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:24,359
the words that are used to describe

810
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,058
cannabis of a certain archetype

811
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,219
um or squirrel tail tiger Tails Tetris

812
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:32,038
so squirrel tail describes like a big

813
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,360
like cheerleader like Pom-Pom style but

814
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,599
you know like really like

815
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:40,859
fake like yeah not to leave very puffy

816
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,839
and then the Tiger Tail is the

817
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:44,038
it's more like the the creeper I've

818
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,839
heard it refer to in English as a

819
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,179
creeper style it makes sense like Robert

820
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,980
described creepers

821
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,159
I think so yeah yeah you have a lot of

822
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,140
lateral branching low to the ground with

823
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,159
these branches sometimes forming new

824
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:02,100
roots and then big swoopy main colas and

825
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,200
strangely the English translation

826
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:07,199
um for Tiger Tail is sometimes rendered

827
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,240
as Rudder and I'm not sure who got

828
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,759
confused the English speakers of the

829
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,919
Thai but some of the ties have also been

830
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,819
telling me that no this is Rudder as in

831
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,820
like

832
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:20,759
boat Roger uh yeah something they'd be

833
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,839
most used to seeing I don't know but in

834
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,640
that sense

835
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,000
we're thinking just like a long upright

836
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
rigid

837
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,599
on some of the Tiger Tail they really do

838
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,179
like they have this huge main top call

839
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,879
and then the branching's already low to

840
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,899
the side so it's quite as with a lot of

841
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,480
these things there's a lot of different

842
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:42,000
stories but so far you know the we were

843
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,819
able to differentiate between the the

844
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,339
the the structure on these two

845
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,200
um and then also the structure for the

846
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:51,000
tire for the snake teeth

847
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,640
um which is the

848
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,558
the vine-like growth kind of like Dr

849
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,720
grinspoon where you have a running

850
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,319
caloric structure

851
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,298
um and then the mango or would be the

852
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,158
you know the mercy enrich

853
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,500
um accessions

854
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,020
um but it's also pretty common to find

855
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,038
mango Aromas in Squirrel tail tiger

856
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:16,918
tails and the snake teeth so ultimately

857
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:20,278
I think that originally it would have

858
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,220
been a singular gene pool which during

859
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,940
its dissemination and the cross-cultural

860
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,220
contact between the Thai the Lao and

861
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,620
other groups in the region

862
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,819
um seeds were exchanged planets were

863
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:37,678
exchanged and we ended up with both

864
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,720
autoctones

865
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,419
um you know land race populations big

866
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,759
open pollinated populations

867
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,380
um sorry autotronus and allotones in

868
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,500
different regions

869
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,760
um a bunch of inbred lines some single

870
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,240
plants

871
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,759
um reproductions from Single Seeds you

872
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,759
know multiplied into millions and then

873
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,158
disseminated and then the mess and a lot

874
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:05,398
of them carry the same names

875
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,280
um so I think it's best understood you

876
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:11,159
know as archetypes within the gene pool

877
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,300
but have since become established as

878
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,000
their own land races and in some cases

879
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:21,780
more like modern strains as in ibls yeah

880
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,239
yeah and all of them coexisting uh

881
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,519
temporally and geographically in some

882
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:30,000
cases pollinating each other yeah it's

883
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:33,739
just like really really complicated

884
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,960
um we basically have done our best to

885
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:40,378
ignore everything that we sort of hear

886
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,720
and focus on what we see yeah and look

887
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,940
for large open pollinated populations

888
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,519
that breed true

889
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,519
um they seem to have you know

890
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,800
um seemed to express what we consider to

891
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,500
look more like a primordial character

892
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,539
but ultimately as long as the population

893
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,239
size is big enough and it's grown in

894
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,940
open pollination then you know that fits

895
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,759
the the base criteria and so we're

896
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,280
looking to collapse from everything but

897
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,160
what we're sort of getting involved in

898
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,200
heavily is is what we can determine to

899
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,539
be the more I don't want to use the word

900
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,419
pure because it's not accurate but the

901
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:20,699
the stuff which is grown properly

902
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,320
managed properly and not just you know

903
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:24,480
every single little thing that we can

904
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,960
find because honestly it's a rabbit hole

905
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,240
there's at this point since legalization

906
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,460
every single Uncle you know whoever had

907
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,319
a single plant in his back Garden making

908
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,940
seats and selling them

909
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,820
um giving them away you know people are

910
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,039
selling clothes for about 30 cents a

911
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,660
clone on the side of the street in in

912
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,059
Bangkok out a little trucks and stuff

913
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:48,059
and so I believe there's this really

914
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:50,460
intense sort of mixing and hybridization

915
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,019
of everything going on at the moment but

916
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,099
that's just sort of the culmination of

917
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:55,858
the last

918
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,780
um 40 50 years and so as far as the laoi

919
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:59,759
sanjin pool is concerned

920
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,380
um we've been looking at plants that you

921
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,380
know look like a squirrel tail look like

922
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,539
a Tiger Tail and our captain they go

923
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,519
from pollinated growth in Fairly remote

924
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,619
regions where we can and basically

925
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,820
that's taken us out of isan for the most

926
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,160
part

927
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,680
um and into the into the more hilly

928
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,779
regions where you can find that

929
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:22,078
you know we can get that distance that's

930
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,079
required to you know to totally prevent

931
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,859
the the cross-contamination

932
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,660
so you've done you've done a lot of work

933
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:33,239
in Thailand to you know try to pick

934
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,039
apart a lot of these stories and over

935
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,779
time it seems like zomi is kind of

936
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,519
spread out a little bit are there any

937
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,320
other areas that you you've been really

938
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,179
excited about that you've been looking

939
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,099
into I mean you've talked about you know

940
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,799
around Thailand there's you know

941
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,599
Cambodia Laos Myanmar are there other

942
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,700
places in there that you're excited

943
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,859
about or elsewhere

944
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:55,439
yeah absolutely

945
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:57,239
um Cambodia is you know the place that I

946
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,059
spent the most time personally so I have

947
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:02,279
a really soft spot for for Cambodia and

948
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,199
a lot of my best friends or or Cambodian

949
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,540
people that you know they were little

950
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,939
rascals and now they're big Rascals and

951
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,759
we're looking forward to being able to

952
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,500
to return there probably this year and

953
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,940
look at what we can do to expand our

954
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,440
collection

955
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,599
um try and see if we can recruit some

956
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,400
some different communities into into the

957
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,680
collective and bring out some new seeds

958
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,260
otherwise Laos you know that's always

959
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,699
one of the most interesting regions

960
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,440
um if you're you know the Thai

961
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,960
nationalism prevents them from admitting

962
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,019
how good the Laos and weed is and the

963
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,579
laoshin reverse with the tie they're

964
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,679
both excellent

965
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:41,060
um there's a lot of synergy there

966
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:43,739
um and you know Laos has a few iconic

967
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:45,059
areas producing you know land race

968
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:48,179
cannabis that we're really looking

969
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:52,199
forward to to go to uh in particular the

970
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:53,159
the C pandon the the 4000 Islands which

971
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,338
is

972
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,899
basically an area of the Mekong where

973
00:37:56,338 --> 00:38:00,539
there's cataracts on the border with

974
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,200
Cambodia and Laos and Mekong spreads out

975
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:06,300
into these loads of islands and it's a

976
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,919
pretty well known tourist destination a

977
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,380
place where a lot of people have you

978
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,019
know fond memories of kicking back and

979
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,260
fishing and smoking great pot from the

980
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:18,420
60s onwards and it has you know

981
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,300
there's not a lot of places left on the

982
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,338
Mekong Pacific Islands which grow this

983
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,500
beautiful golden weed which all the

984
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:27,059
old-timers are looking for and so that's

985
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,800
probably going to be one of the the

986
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,420
priorities in terms of where we're going

987
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,119
to be going around it's not necessarily

988
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,039
grown within the main areas but you know

989
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,720
along the Cataract there's there's a lot

990
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:37,739
of people growing here and there and

991
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,838
we're looking forward to getting some

992
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,399
seeds so yeah golden meekong wheat

993
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,480
blouse that's going to be I think that's

994
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,700
going to be a big hit with the

995
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,139
old-timers but there's a lot of stuff in

996
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,419
the north of the Street near the border

997
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:50,219
with unan and then of course the the

998
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,320
Bola Haven Plateau

999
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:55,739
um that's beautiful coffee growing

1000
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,480
region with a significant amount of uh

1001
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,879
local population belonging to the Lavin

1002
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,619
ethnic group who is a very talented

1003
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,420
cannabis Growers

1004
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,338
um there's so much in Laos that we can

1005
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,019
explore it's really a very very diverse

1006
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:09,900
country very small but with a lot of

1007
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:12,119
diversity in cannabis and in the people

1008
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,180
the Landscapes and everything Myanmar

1009
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,858
unfortunately is um this you know I mean

1010
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,419
it feels a bit silly saying

1011
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:19,739
unfortunately in the context of seeds

1012
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,960
because that's not really what makes it

1013
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:24,419
sad obviously but me and Mars undergoing

1014
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,338
you know uh severe political upheaval

1015
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,320
Civil War

1016
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:31,500
um if anybody um

1017
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,359
you know wants to wants to help out

1018
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,539
they're taking Volunteers in Chiang Mai

1019
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,819
right now you can go and uh sign up to

1020
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:40,980
go fight for the for the militias that

1021
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,900
are fighting against the government it's

1022
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,599
it's absolute chaos out there it's been

1023
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,599
getting really really really bad and you

1024
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,980
know we we're not doing anything in

1025
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,760
Myanmar right now

1026
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,380
um

1027
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,140
yeah it doesn't make any sense it

1028
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,280
doesn't sound so safe right now or or I

1029
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,799
mean people's priorities are different

1030
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,780
right now yeah that's it people's

1031
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,980
priorities are different and and we

1032
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,839
don't feel like

1033
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,940
um we've spoken to you know to our

1034
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,159
contacts out there and we theoretically

1035
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,960
could get seeds out but it just again it

1036
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,179
doesn't seem like a priority

1037
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,519
um I think the priority probably seems

1038
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,919
to be for us now to to continue focusing

1039
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,960
on our work in Cambodia Laos

1040
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,380
um and in the northeast of India in you

1041
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,900
know mizoram tripura nagaland Etc

1042
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,000
um but we're also very very excited to

1043
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,579
to be bringing out some some Colombian

1044
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,858
genetics hopefully soon oh wow

1045
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,760
yeah well we're all very excited about

1046
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:34,078
that

1047
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,640
um this is a lot of similarities with

1048
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,060
the tie it seems between you know the

1049
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,379
Caribbean and Latin American Gene pools

1050
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:43,199
um we're looking forward to having

1051
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,760
closer collaboration with us and you

1052
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,399
know Growers members of our collective

1053
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,960
in that group and together try to build

1054
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,700
a better picture of you know what's

1055
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,400
going on with the land races between the

1056
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,719
two regions a lot of similarities in the

1057
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,119
in the the sort of setting up

1058
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,679
semi-outdoor uh curing styles with

1059
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,160
golden weed as a result that kind of

1060
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:02,879
thing and so

1061
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,118
our

1062
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,039
um yeah our boys are based in kalka but

1063
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,200
they're mobile so we're looking forward

1064
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,779
to Bringing out some some genetics from

1065
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,879
there pretty pretty soon

1066
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,339
um pretty sure the next dropped or the

1067
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,440
the current drop is probably I just we

1068
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:22,320
just came back from from Himachal

1069
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,780
Pradesh but uh I think next is going to

1070
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:28,079
be yeah in that order Thailand Cambodia

1071
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,180
Laos followed by followed by India again

1072
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,280
can we talk about some of the current

1073
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:33,779
recent accessions that you got

1074
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,339
um that are on your site right now let's

1075
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,380
talk about some of those so people have

1076
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:39,358
a uh an understanding from you other

1077
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,099
than what you write which is uh like

1078
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:45,000
that's kind of what initially drew me to

1079
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,320
you you know a good friend of Neville's

1080
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,420
um send me to your son said you've got

1081
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,420
to check these guys out man like this is

1082
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,880
legit and I did and it's not just it's

1083
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,099
not just descriptions like lulling you

1084
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,640
in with you know words and marketing

1085
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,619
it's how you collected it it's how you

1086
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,118
listed the accessions it's done very

1087
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,400
well like in my opinion very

1088
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,019
scientifically and all the details that

1089
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,700
people need to know

1090
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,320
um a lot of people will of course Be

1091
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:12,659
Wondering like what is this taste and

1092
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,059
smell like what's a THC content you know

1093
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:17,219
like what's the high yeah and and and

1094
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:18,480
not not understanding that like they're

1095
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:20,039
thinking of it from a very modern

1096
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,920
mindset of what's this going to be like

1097
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,838
in my room indoors and we just it's not

1098
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,599
something you can really tell them you

1099
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,719
know how this plant that grows outdoors

1100
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,039
in in this Expresses in this environment

1101
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,838
now it's going to be indoors in your

1102
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,239
environment where it's never been you

1103
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,099
know so right yeah please talk about

1104
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,799
some of your your more recent accessions

1105
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:44,280
and and what people can expect

1106
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,200
sure so yeah like uh like you said we

1107
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,140
don't really we don't really put you

1108
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,000
know like expected yields or you know we

1109
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,159
do we do go into terpene profiles a

1110
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,858
little bit but you know not massively

1111
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,539
and certainly not THC percentages or

1112
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:59,279
anything exactly I'd like to know that

1113
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,800
you know we've found some accessions in

1114
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,079
Cambodia which have very few trichome

1115
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,720
heads on them however they absolutely

1116
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,940
laugh and so I'm just gonna go ahead and

1117
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,679
go on a limb and say that maybe there's

1118
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,519
even some other kind of annoy to play

1119
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,639
there

1120
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,980
um and so you know measuring you know

1121
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,679
that strange quality or that accessions

1122
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,858
quality based on its THC percentage just

1123
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,078
seems like an absurdity yeah um there's

1124
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:27,179
so many missing cannabinoids out there

1125
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,460
like that we that aren't tested for we

1126
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:32,159
have no clue what is causing some of

1127
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,420
these highs right right so for as far as

1128
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,598
the most recent exceptions we were in

1129
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,420
Parvati Valley which um is you know one

1130
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,940
of the the true hot spots of land races

1131
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,400
in the world in in India

1132
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,559
um it's maybe not as much of a priority

1133
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,440
as far as conservation goes the farmers

1134
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,940
there are pretty pretty well off and

1135
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,980
doing pretty well in fact they don't

1136
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,619
really need our help in the same way

1137
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,838
that farmers in Southeast Asia do but

1138
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:59,700
it's important to us because Parvati is

1139
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,578
one of the most visible one of the most

1140
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:04,500
famous of the growing regions in in the

1141
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,960
whole world and so you know without

1142
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,659
having you know a few pictures and some

1143
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,139
accessions from Milana it's really hard

1144
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:14,879
to have that clout as a you know a land

1145
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:17,759
race Collective you know is that where

1146
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,539
Milana is in Parvati Valley or is it

1147
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,339
called it is yeah yeah it is in the

1148
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,440
state of Himachal Pradesh which

1149
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:28,078
basically means like the you know the

1150
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,440
the Himachal Province and machale is

1151
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,619
like a Heavenly Mountain I believe in

1152
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:38,519
and it's the it's you know the the place

1153
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,960
outside of Kathmandu so basically a lot

1154
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,659
of um

1155
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:46,619
Parvati Valley is in is in Himachal

1156
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:49,379
Pradesh which is in the north of India

1157
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:52,200
near the near the border with with China

1158
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,480
and not so far away from Pakistan

1159
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,719
kashmirs in between it's in the the

1160
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,059
northwest of the of the country and

1161
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:03,239
it's basically a hub for cannabis

1162
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:05,940
growing since the since the 1960s as one

1163
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,559
of the sort of the tail ends uh of the

1164
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,519
of the hippie Trail you know other than

1165
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,619
do in Nepal and starting I'm not exactly

1166
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:17,159
sure when but you know I would say maybe

1167
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,619
late 70s early 80s a lot of Italians I'm

1168
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:21,899
coming to Parvati

1169
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:24,720
um La Paz and Malana villages in

1170
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,579
particular and

1171
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,500
um and getting involved with Charis

1172
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:30,720
production there and so it's had a big

1173
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,639
International reputation

1174
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,239
um and in Europe

1175
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,259
um pavati hash is not necessarily the

1176
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,799
most common

1177
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,560
but in a lot of places in Italy um in

1178
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,240
this Scandinavian countries is one of

1179
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:48,119
the prestige

1180
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:51,959
um hash that is is available on offer

1181
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:54,900
and so for us it it's it seems like you

1182
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,119
know a very a priority let's say

1183
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,800
basically because you know when

1184
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,539
foreigners are learning and educating

1185
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,339
themselves about land races one of the

1186
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:04,159
first places that they learn about is

1187
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,719
generally

1188
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:09,118
you know Tosh this kind of thing and so

1189
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:12,118
yeah we we felt like in order to bring

1190
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,338
attention to smaller villages in other

1191
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,380
parts of India and in other countries in

1192
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,299
Thailand that it was in the best

1193
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:21,240
interest of approaching and working with

1194
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,920
the farmers there and so but the farmers

1195
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:24,899
there they're not

1196
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,720
conservation is needed everywhere but

1197
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,519
Milana and liminal but Parvati Valley as

1198
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,838
a whole is sort of one of the more

1199
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,239
stable

1200
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,338
um one of the larger land race producing

1201
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,219
regions the people there are holding on

1202
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:40,679
to their Traditions pretty hard

1203
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:42,659
and so it's not necessarily an area

1204
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,759
where we can engage in necessarily the

1205
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:47,219
the same type of conservation work that

1206
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,400
we can in tribal regions in the

1207
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,259
northeast of India or elsewhere

1208
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,599
um but it's somewhere where we you know

1209
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,540
could Source some very high quality

1210
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:01,559
seeds from very very famous gardens

1211
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:04,259
maybe you know do our part in helping to

1212
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:05,759
build up the body of knowledge for what

1213
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,520
could eventually be an appellation

1214
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,440
system in the region

1215
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,940
um and you know that that in particular

1216
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,179
is something with it on a personal level

1217
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,280
I'd love to to see happen and you know

1218
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:19,500
it'd be a privilege to be involved in

1219
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,119
anything even remote to that

1220
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,338
um I think Parvati is one of the the

1221
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,460
grand crew so to speak of the the

1222
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:30,059
Cannabis world there's a lot of it's a

1223
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,159
storied place with a big diversity of in

1224
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:35,159
French we call them reliodi and Klima

1225
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:38,179
they refer to the smallest Geographic

1226
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:41,039
designation basically individual plots

1227
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:44,219
sometimes having multiple within one

1228
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:48,480
Vineyard and so you know in Parvati we

1229
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:50,399
see a similar system with very small

1230
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,920
individual plots making up a

1231
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,139
constellation that forms a larger sort

1232
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,000
of system that spread throughout the

1233
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:59,818
whole valley and so that provides us

1234
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,159
with a lot of different Expressions

1235
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:04,500
um you know of that gene pool from the

1236
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,078
various sort of terroir of the area

1237
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,179
whether they be the the dark side of the

1238
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,480
valley with a lot of humidity a lot of

1239
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:15,299
rain or you know the the best most sunny

1240
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,800
spots at High Altitude above Milano

1241
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,300
Village right and everything in between

1242
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:23,039
and so in total we made 74 accessions

1243
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,560
um which I

1244
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,679
I maybe it's I don't need you but I just

1245
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:32,299
want to point out like how much tracking

1246
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,299
was involved okay

1247
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:39,358
you know Gardens that are uh you know

1248
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:39,959
between let's say 2 100 to 3

1249
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,259
000

1250
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:46,619
4 000 meters basically at the highest so

1251
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,720
um between what like 6 000 to to almost

1252
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,940
12 000 feet

1253
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,858
um and a lot of The Villages for example

1254
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,780
uh Tosh

1255
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:56,039
um maybe I don't actually know the exact

1256
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,000
outage

1257
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:02,400
um the result is 2600 or so

1258
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,338
um and uh because I Ram Fields above it

1259
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,519
are hitting 3 000 right and so yeah you

1260
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:11,099
need to get up to Russell and then up to

1261
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,659
the fields Beyond so similarly to in

1262
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,579
Southeast Asia we're next to the rice

1263
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,960
fields there's these little Huts where

1264
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,220
they dry out

1265
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,119
um a lot of the products and where they

1266
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,980
rest

1267
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,140
during the hot parts of the day there's

1268
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,960
rubbing houses in a lot of the higher

1269
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:27,179
fields in Parvati and so a lot of the

1270
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,280
time we were hanging out with the boys

1271
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,299
there and asking them you know like you

1272
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,339
know what's the name of this Garden

1273
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,140
what's the name of that Garden you know

1274
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:36,239
can you make sure you separate plants

1275
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:40,379
from those two next time you rub we'll

1276
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,879
we'll give you more money yeah honestly

1277
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,660
they're like why would the Foreigner pay

1278
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,400
more

1279
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:46,739
is for knowing that it comes from one

1280
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,019
garden and not the other and then you're

1281
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:52,979
like let's put some [ __ ] stamps on

1282
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:55,380
the Charis and uh yeah right that's very

1283
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,760
Western mentality and

1284
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,559
um I think but I think it's it's

1285
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,880
rewarding and it helps it helps the

1286
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,799
farmers differentiate their product

1287
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,700
without having any change on the product

1288
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,039
itself and you know it helps us again to

1289
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:09,899
to bring a better clearer picture of

1290
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,960
what is going on in the gene pool in

1291
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,800
that area and to represent that visually

1292
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,960
a text and with our seats

1293
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,640
I'm really excited about that um you

1294
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,380
were telling a story yesterday about

1295
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,239
hand rubbing that I thought was

1296
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,019
fascinating and like the one thing that

1297
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,699
like

1298
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:32,280
as as a person you might have a few ocds

1299
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:34,980
um like the idea of hand rubbing like to

1300
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,319
me is is skin cells and stuff like that

1301
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,380
like that drives me nuts but I

1302
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:43,440
understand the tradition and the quality

1303
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,358
that goes along with this and you had an

1304
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,980
interesting story about like how bad it

1305
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,480
can screw up your hands

1306
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,099
um can you tell me a little bit about

1307
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,139
that so people can understand what goes

1308
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,059
into this yeah

1309
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:56,639
um I'm actually what I didn't mean to

1310
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:58,680
emphasize that honestly like the I think

1311
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,279
the eyelashes are more of a concern than

1312
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:04,259
this really yeah yeah because you like

1313
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,300
you'll never even really see the skin

1314
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,760
cell you'll just notice that your hands

1315
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,079
feel a bit papery and thin right and

1316
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,819
then you know if you let them dry out

1317
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,619
afterwards they'll get all ragged but

1318
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,880
yeah you'll often notice little

1319
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,260
eyelashes

1320
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,900
um because they're always hunched over

1321
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,460
when they're oh yeah yeah or when

1322
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,740
they're rubbing so

1323
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,420
um basically you know everybody all the

1324
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,039
foreigners they come up to Parvati for

1325
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,599
the first time and they have it in their

1326
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:29,219
head that they're gonna you know run

1327
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,850
naked through the field of weed maybe

1328
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:34,928
yeah something like that right yeah

1329
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:34,929
[Music]

1330
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,960
and then I also want to say before I

1331
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:41,699
before we say anything else you know

1332
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,500
because a lot of these conversations in

1333
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:45,779
the past have led to people going to

1334
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,880
where we've talked about on the back of

1335
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,740
me explaining where the grows are if you

1336
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,740
go to Milano Valley and you touch any

1337
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:54,539
plants expect to pay about a 500 fine

1338
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:57,179
for every plant that you touch every

1339
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:59,219
time you touch one they are not so keen

1340
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:01,679
on foreigners coming in and but in other

1341
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:03,779
places you can yeah probably run naked

1342
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,940
through the fields as you imagine you

1343
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,339
could it could and

1344
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,200
um you know the the first thing is like

1345
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:12,480
okay well I'm not gonna buy hash while

1346
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:14,098
I'm here because I'm a cannabis nerd and

1347
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,500
I know how it's made so I'm gonna rub it

1348
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:18,960
myself yeah so you wait rarely and you

1349
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,460
go up and you rub and you rub and you'll

1350
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,338
notice that unless you're doing this

1351
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,500
regularly it takes a big toll on your

1352
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:27,539
hands the terpenes are somewhat caustic

1353
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,940
and you're applying a lot of pressure

1354
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:32,279
onto your palms and specifically when

1355
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,980
you're collecting the matter at the end

1356
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,440
you're pressing your thumb not only is

1357
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:40,139
it pretty bad on your our joints pretty

1358
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,639
quickly but you'll notice blisters on

1359
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,838
your thumb if your Technique isn't on

1360
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,879
point

1361
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:46,739
um so I think that yeah for people who

1362
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,960
have these kind of like uh you know

1363
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:50,279
whether it's OCD or just you know being

1364
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,338
concerned about hygiene which is

1365
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,960
reasonable you know I get yeah yeah

1366
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:57,000
I can't even see the skin cells but like

1367
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,280
even when I when I'm like doing that at

1368
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,159
home like going through picking seeds

1369
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,079
and I've got like caked caked or resin

1370
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,779
on my hands I'm thinking but if I smoke

1371
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:10,800
this and it's not really going to be

1372
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:13,619
perfect you know but yeah also also

1373
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:17,579
knowing about melodic cream that is like

1374
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:20,280
in my mind like supposed to be what the

1375
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,980
ultimate hash what I understand melonic

1376
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,839
cream so that's like there's no way any

1377
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,719
skin cell would make me pass up some

1378
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,338
melanocrine to try you know the top

1379
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,199
level cream will have very few skin

1380
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:33,119
cells in it because the whole point of

1381
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,960
cream is for it to be very delicately

1382
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,358
rubbed yes um and so when you do rub it

1383
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,760
delicately there's you know and also

1384
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,739
we're talking about you know for for

1385
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,180
someone with soft hands who doesn't rub

1386
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:46,439
every year then yeah it's going to be

1387
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,019
filled with skin that's a good point

1388
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,838
whatever you calloused hand not so much

1389
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:53,818
yeah yeah

1390
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,799
um I will say though that during the

1391
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:59,338
season you'll find the whole village is

1392
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:02,280
empties and you know

1393
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:04,199
in a way you could child exploitation or

1394
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,579
whatever but I mean I mean it's not

1395
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,439
really like they have such thing as

1396
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,599
child care up in the hills either so

1397
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,119
we'll leave the kids at home now they

1398
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,838
come with and the whole family rubs and

1399
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:18,599
you better believe that the dad is gonna

1400
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,039
tell you later like yo this was my 16

1401
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:21,420
year old daughter who rubbed this her

1402
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,818
hands are really soft you can pay more

1403
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,260
for this you know oh I bet yeah you do

1404
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:26,818
that they're always like no no this is

1405
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,619
the youngest you know the this is my

1406
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:31,079
wife or it's always the wife or the

1407
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:33,900
daughter who's actually gets the highest

1408
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:37,800
prices that's funny very typical though

1409
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:41,460
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1410
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,559
so is there like you mentioned Colombia

1411
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,780
is there any other like pie in the sky

1412
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,640
like ideas you want to pull off with

1413
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,079
omia that you haven't yet

1414
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:51,799
yeah

1415
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:55,140
um we'd like to I mean

1416
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:57,539
a lot of things we'd love to to get more

1417
00:54:55,139 --> 00:55:01,739
into the production uh and aging and

1418
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:02,940
then selling of Thai stick and Charis

1419
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:04,739
um those are what we're passionate about

1420
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,358
traditional compression curing and

1421
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:09,358
traditional hand rubbing you know the

1422
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:12,078
the artisanal craft which don't involve

1423
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,400
the mediation of many tools or Machinery

1424
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,900
in the elaboration of traditional

1425
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,980
cannabis products that's always going to

1426
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,079
be something that we want to get

1427
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,519
involved in so I just maybe if you'll

1428
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,780
allow me want to go back a little bit to

1429
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:23,099
Milana

1430
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,140
um

1431
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:26,280
yeah no I think I think that there's a

1432
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:29,179
bit more Nuance that needs to be

1433
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,180
explained here sure

1434
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,920
the cream the charas is rubbed from

1435
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,960
domesticate plants

1436
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,180
um which over the course of the last 25

1437
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,099
years in particular every single farmer

1438
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:43,799
who's been around long enough to see it

1439
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:46,440
talks about a decline in THC levels and

1440
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,780
in in trichome condensity and so it went

1441
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,480
from being a lesser amount of plants

1442
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,119
needed to rub 10 grams to a much higher

1443
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,500
amount of plants okay

1444
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:58,380
10 grams and so

1445
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,119
my personal experiences in India were

1446
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,079
not in Parvati Valley actually the first

1447
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,380
ones

1448
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:06,300
um they were in mostly in kinar in spiti

1449
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,338
um in the more remote regions of

1450
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,559
Himachal Pradesh where there's much less

1451
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:13,858
of a tourist drug trade and much more of

1452
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,740
a local traditional consumption and

1453
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:19,980
there the Charis is referred to as

1454
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:21,959
jungli jungli being the word which gave

1455
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:25,440
us the word in English for Jungle it

1456
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,599
means forest in Hindi and his Forest

1457
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,420
hash in that regards can be thought of

1458
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,640
as hash rubbed from feral plants yes now

1459
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,700
the hash rub from feral plants in my

1460
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,338
opinion that is the Pinnacle of the

1461
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:40,799
world of Charis because not only have

1462
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:42,420
the domesticate plants been losing

1463
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,019
um I can't really explain much more

1464
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:48,059
about why but the the the testimony of

1465
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:50,759
the farmers that they're losing

1466
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:53,460
um THC content over time

1467
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,440
um whereas the feral plants are becoming

1468
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,260
irrelevant with very few people outside

1469
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,358
side of like for example in Kulu which

1470
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,280
is at the bottom of the valley

1471
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:05,098
um it's a much bigger city it's outside

1472
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,260
of Hawaii you'll find drug addicts like

1473
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:08,940
you know going and rubbing handsworth

1474
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,200
from the feral plants on you know the

1475
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,818
dusty ice plants on the side of the road

1476
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,219
that happens

1477
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:16,558
um but more and more in the main sort of

1478
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:19,199
producing Villages like rasal Malana

1479
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,940
there are far less feral plants now than

1480
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,439
there were before because the feral

1481
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,900
plants are often the first to be

1482
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,480
targeted in in eradication campaigns you

1483
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,280
know the cops will come and put a little

1484
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,019
bit of pressure and the cops themselves

1485
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,319
probably won't be clearing the field but

1486
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,480
they'll be telling the villagers

1487
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:38,818
and they'll clear the federal plants

1488
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,880
below the village that are in plain view

1489
00:57:38,818 --> 00:57:43,800
of the path yeah what's up Village you

1490
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,180
know and that doesn't satisfy the Cubs

1491
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,339
then maybe they'll cut down a few

1492
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:49,078
domestic Fields so I think that really

1493
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:51,719
the sort of the Pinnacle the Holy Grail

1494
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:54,660
whatever you want to call it is the the

1495
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,299
jungli is the and not all jungle is

1496
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:59,879
equal it needs to be

1497
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,680
who can rub very well and can rub a good

1498
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,019
quality cream slowly without much

1499
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,659
contaminant but if he rubs from feral

1500
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:09,719
plants you can expect a bigger diversity

1501
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:12,659
of cannabinoids and terpenes which you

1502
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,699
know when consumed fresh or aged leads

1503
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:17,399
to much more pronounced and distinct

1504
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:20,699
experience and I think that's where the

1505
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,880
magic of of Parvati and Charis in

1506
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:26,039
general is is is live resin made from

1507
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,619
you know live plants

1508
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,818
um funnily enough all the all the Gora

1509
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,559
you know all the foreigners they're

1510
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:33,019
pretty excited about consuming it fresh

1511
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,460
because that's when it's really terpy

1512
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:37,920
but it's also quite caustic on the

1513
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:40,380
throat all local swear by smoking it

1514
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,240
after a year when it's lost a lot of its

1515
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,160
taste but it's much smoother and

1516
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,179
provides a more competitive narcotic

1517
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,139
kind of effect

1518
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:51,358
that's really interesting

1519
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:53,098
uh I think so too man I love going out

1520
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,279
there and trying all this stuff you know

1521
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:57,960
the locals are like yo like because they

1522
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,220
don't have some they produce a lot but

1523
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,900
they don't produce a lot of the best

1524
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,719
grades you normally need to commission

1525
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:05,338
that so if you wanted say a few kilos of

1526
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,379
super cream or something you'd need to

1527
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:09,239
come in advance and say I want you to

1528
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,579
make and you need to trust and stuff and

1529
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,139
so when you're sort of going there on

1530
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:14,940
the spot and asking them give me your

1531
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:16,858
best stuff they're kind of like don't

1532
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,220
smoke it too quick and I'm like here I'm

1533
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:21,480
on a mission try everything

1534
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:24,719
as fast as possible so you better

1535
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:28,079
believe you know yeah dude

1536
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:30,239
yeah man I you know usually my I have my

1537
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,220
co-host Nazo with me and right now I

1538
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,039
would be making a joke about sending him

1539
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:36,838
over to suitcase some a lot of cream and

1540
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,298
bring it back you know what I mean the

1541
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:42,480
the old traditional suitcase if you get

1542
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:44,400
my drift yeah

1543
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,740
um

1544
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,798
I remember back in uh I was in Denmark

1545
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:51,598
for a little brief time

1546
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,519
she met a Danish chick and they're

1547
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,940
pretty famous for bringing bringing the

1548
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,139
dudes back to Denmark and anyway

1549
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,880
they got this little hippie commune

1550
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:00,779
there that sort of or anarchists call me

1551
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,160
in the

1552
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,660
um let's change a lot but basically

1553
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,940
there's kind of this Marketplace and

1554
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:07,920
it's all it's changed a lot a lot a lot

1555
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,940
so but back in the day I remember there

1556
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,318
was always

1557
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:17,460
um ass hash or briefcase hash uh well

1558
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:20,519
like eggs or super flat or big bricks of

1559
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,679
kashmiri that came God knows

1560
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,298
but you know it was always like the the

1561
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:26,639
briefcase hash yeah man that was yeah

1562
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:27,679
yeah how often did you choose the ass

1563
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,118
hash

1564
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:33,058
honestly I don't like it you know like

1565
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,980
you know what like uh there's a study

1566
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:39,119
with Madrid where they found that like

1567
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:41,099
every sample of uh of hash that they

1568
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,798
they found was contaminated with fecal

1569
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:47,160
matter oh wow do you ever heard of that

1570
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:48,480
yeah yeah brutal look I think you know

1571
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:50,578
I'm not that's definitely not something

1572
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,920
I'm looking to consume yeah

1573
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:55,559
but you know in order to maybe sort of

1574
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,940
contextualize this and

1575
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,440
um everything else that might seem a

1576
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,760
little bit odd about hygiene that we're

1577
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,980
talking about

1578
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,680
um I I think I'd like to sort of

1579
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:06,298
um explain a little bit about how

1580
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:09,480
um you know an analogy in winemaking

1581
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:12,119
would maybe be the most uh illustrative

1582
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,699
um and it's that when you have an Old

1583
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,559
Winery with you know very porous walls

1584
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:19,259
from an old traditional building you

1585
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,599
know one that wasn't built you know up

1586
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,160
to code or according to what some

1587
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,960
bureaucrats wanted just traditional

1588
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,399
building you know people knocked it up

1589
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,280
because they needed it

1590
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,318
um those walls will accumulate yeast and

1591
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,780
all these things over long long periods

1592
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:35,338
of time but when you're talking about a

1593
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,260
country which has you know heavy

1594
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:38,699
bureaucracy especially when it comes to

1595
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,579
things like food products you know the

1596
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:43,439
US does not allow like I mean maybe this

1597
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:45,480
has changed but I remember like it was a

1598
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,519
big deal that if you guys didn't allow

1599
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,019
like raw cow's milk cheese which is like

1600
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:52,559
the best cheese

1601
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:55,500
okay yeah yeah like the live you know

1602
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,980
lactic bacteria culture leads to much

1603
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,599
more complexity of taste and flavor

1604
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,460
but there are a huge big hygiene you

1605
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:04,798
know concerns in the US which

1606
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,599
confuses me because I also get told on

1607
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,818
the other side that standards are lacks

1608
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,559
compared to the EU and so I think

1609
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:12,179
without being a chauvinist or without

1610
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,680
trying to

1611
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:16,618
um I'd like to I don't know I guess

1612
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:19,798
praise the the the the Europeans for

1613
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:22,318
having that sort of uh ability to be

1614
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:24,420
very hygienic when they think that it

1615
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,739
matters yeah for example during the

1616
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,500
harvesting of the grapes and everything

1617
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:30,000
else but allowing certain contaminants

1618
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,880
during other parts of the process

1619
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,338
because they're either a part of the

1620
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,260
traditional method or they have some

1621
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:41,039
sort of an impact on the taste or

1622
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,780
something yeah in that regards I I kind

1623
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,460
of place the skin cells in that regards

1624
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,720
it's if you're a Craft Beer Drinker

1625
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,699
you'll probably

1626
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:49,259
seeing the Brett beer that's came about

1627
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:51,960
in the last sort of

1628
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,180
10 years or so and you know

1629
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:58,079
um we describe it as like barnyard

1630
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:59,940
Aromas and smells right and taste we

1631
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,859
find it very typically in well it's

1632
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,358
caused by bacterial infection which you

1633
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:05,338
know you can get rid of through proper

1634
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:07,920
hygiene yeah I find it a lot in French

1635
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:09,659
wines and you know the Americans you

1636
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,099
know they they're tasting panels when

1637
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:12,960
the supermarkets are going to buy like

1638
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:14,960
100 000 liters of stuff and they're like

1639
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,599
nope

1640
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,579
and it took you know decades and for the

1641
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,859
craft beer and hipsters to come out and

1642
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:25,140
be like no these bacterias are actually

1643
01:03:22,858 --> 01:03:27,239
okay and we're gonna incorporate them

1644
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,739
you know voluntarily into the beer and

1645
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,899
then that's still changing the mind but

1646
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,659
there is a big difference sort of

1647
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:36,298
um there's a big difference in

1648
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:39,058
um the the way the traditional water

1649
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:41,280
driven products are conceived of and the

1650
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:42,960
requirements you know a lot of people

1651
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,740
um where I come from might say that if

1652
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,139
you

1653
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:49,259
create a formula and you sanitize

1654
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:51,719
everything then it can't express the the

1655
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,540
soil and the culture and the life you

1656
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:56,039
know yeah so so bear that in mind if you

1657
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:58,858
feel a little bit disgusted by finger

1658
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:00,480
hash yeah yeah you know it's it's one of

1659
01:03:58,858 --> 01:04:02,400
those things where it's like hey I can't

1660
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,858
see it but in my in the back of my mind

1661
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,980
it's always there you know it's just

1662
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:09,719
like on someone's proteins yeah you know

1663
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,219
I will I'll tell you what what you

1664
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:12,779
really should worry about and this is

1665
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:14,818
this is a significant concern actually

1666
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,079
is is adulterance

1667
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,139
um adulterance

1668
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,839
um caused by the I mean the size of the

1669
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:24,058
of the fields in place like Parvati or

1670
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:27,900
in uttarakhand they've increased

1671
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:29,339
passively you know 10 volt 100 fold or

1672
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,139
in you know different places over the

1673
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:34,199
course of the last few decades and they

1674
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:37,199
still can't quite meet um demand and so

1675
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:39,659
you know there's always sort of a lack

1676
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:42,960
of product and for example in poverty

1677
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:45,179
the the backstop is made up by Nepalese

1678
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,940
who themselves make up the the laboring

1679
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:51,419
class in Himachal Pradesh and they also

1680
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:53,519
often rub hash on contract for himachali

1681
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,260
landowners and if they can't meet their

1682
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,780
quotas they'll incorporate a little bit

1683
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,980
of Nepali hash into into the Milan at

1684
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,319
the bulk it out so they can get a better

1685
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,298
price per gram from their landlord

1686
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,519
um and then down in the in the valley

1687
01:05:03,298 --> 01:05:07,440
it's definitely being contaminated or

1688
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:11,039
adulterated with all sorts of things

1689
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,440
like dupe like incense sticks henna

1690
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,699
um just mud

1691
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,619
random crap

1692
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:18,539
um just in order to to you know bulk it

1693
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:20,818
up and I mean explain why they do

1694
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,900
everybody knows why they do it yeah but

1695
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:23,400
the other thing the one when you're

1696
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,920
getting only the top quality and you

1697
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,240
know it's not adult rated well then you

1698
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,200
need to make sure you know you're

1699
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,939
probably going to want to rub it

1700
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:31,798
yourself if you're worried about hygiene

1701
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,079
is that they do stuff like when they're

1702
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:36,239
first starting they'll rub their

1703
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,940
eyebrows in order to get some oil on

1704
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,798
their fingers and that will provide the

1705
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,000
the first

1706
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,019
um you know because what you're trying

1707
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,059
to do is you're trying to lift the

1708
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:46,619
trichomes off of the off of the plant

1709
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:49,319
yeah so

1710
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:52,260
in they need you need good weather

1711
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:54,599
conditions and you need your hands to be

1712
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,040
the basically the perfect humidity and

1713
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,500
smooth if they're too dry or something

1714
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,900
it's not a real problem if your hands do

1715
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,480
need to be conditioned somehow the

1716
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,880
easiest way is to spit on them or to rub

1717
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,980
your hair to rub behind your ears to rub

1718
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,420
your eyebrows and they do that and the

1719
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,760
most oil that part of your face yeah

1720
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,798
yeah yeah they got the same I mean so

1721
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,220
yeah honestly I probably shouldn't be

1722
01:06:13,798 --> 01:06:18,900
saying this stuff on

1723
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:21,539
but it's the truth you know it's part of

1724
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:24,960
the culture and how exactly and frankly

1725
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:27,358
when you're combusting it

1726
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,460
yeah you're burning the [ __ ] out of it

1727
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:32,880
right but but I understand the icky part

1728
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:34,500
of it yeah I mean yeah it's it's just

1729
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,200
one of those things as an OCD person

1730
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,460
like that it just yeah but I I can get

1731
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,500
over it pretty easily when it comes to

1732
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,420
weed or I mean I just think back to the

1733
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:45,239
[ __ ] that was in like

1734
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:48,059
hard drugs that I did and it's like it's

1735
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:49,739
finger like worrying about skin compared

1736
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:53,579
to some of the cut that was in hard

1737
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:55,919
drugs like it just it seems uh silly but

1738
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,599
yeah there we are

1739
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,980
so a lot of people that are going to be

1740
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:04,940
going to your site after watching the

1741
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:08,219
show which is um zumia cannabisco.com

1742
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:10,619
we do stuff by consensus and the

1743
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:12,798
consensus was a an unwieldy and

1744
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:15,838
cumbersome website name and

1745
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:18,380
advantages of being uh you know a

1746
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:20,058
collective led by consensus so yeah

1747
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:22,740
zomia

1748
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:23,760
cannabisco.com so one of the first

1749
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,379
questions that people are going to be

1750
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,299
asking and I know and you're probably

1751
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,700
going to get 100 emails about this after

1752
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:31,920
so I figured maybe let's just try to

1753
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:34,439
curb some of the emails so what's what's

1754
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,559
one of the lines you would recommend for

1755
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,858
a California indoor garden from your

1756
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,640
indoor garden indoor light Garden from

1757
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:45,598
your

1758
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:48,000
um selections and exceptions so I think

1759
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,920
that there's like um it's kind of like

1760
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,480
the Chinese restaurants in the UK or the

1761
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,180
US you know people feel more comfortable

1762
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,519
with kind of like an intermediary or

1763
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:58,078
familiarity of some sort yeah wheat in

1764
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:00,599
diversion perhaps a little bit less

1765
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:02,700
spicy and so in that regards I think

1766
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:04,740
some of the land race ibls can be quite

1767
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:07,259
appropriate for Growers who lack the

1768
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:10,259
confidence to approach you know a long

1769
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:13,200
flowering varietal in that regards the

1770
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:15,420
the the classic sort of uh lowland Thai

1771
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:18,420
stick accession from us would be the Dai

1772
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:20,338
Deng which is the transliteration for

1773
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,920
Red Thread

1774
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:24,960
um that's the the legendary Red Thread

1775
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,719
Thai sticks from from Eastern from back

1776
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,420
in the day we're working with a clan

1777
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,239
from who you know have been working with

1778
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,579
old seed stock reproducing in a in a

1779
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:38,639
pretty large population now uh since

1780
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:40,979
quite a few years before legalization

1781
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,440
um yeah and so that would be a little

1782
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:45,899
bit you know shorter flowering

1783
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,338
um a little bit you know more it's still

1784
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,778
going to have a lot of vigor but it's

1785
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:51,119
going to be a bit more uniform in its

1786
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:52,620
canopy and its growth patterns and so as

1787
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,599
far as the the sort of the very

1788
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:56,579
equatorial lines I think that would be a

1789
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,100
really approachable line for beginners

1790
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:01,679
saying that the picture I think that's

1791
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:06,298
on the background here of the of the

1792
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:09,960
post of the issue and that's a scar

1793
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:11,698
Karen genetics from the King krachan

1794
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,279
National Park area on the border with

1795
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:17,639
Myanmar in Thailand yeah I can see it's

1796
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:19,500
huge plant grows really vigorously you

1797
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,539
know it just it's resistant to

1798
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,219
everything you don't need to walk too

1799
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:26,100
much don't need to feed it much it just

1800
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:28,798
grows like hell and so if space isn't

1801
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,179
your concern you know then you know you

1802
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,198
can consider going for something like

1803
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:33,600
that

1804
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:36,659
um but ultimately if you're working with

1805
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,460
really stretchy long flowering varietals

1806
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:40,079
like this there are quite a few tricks

1807
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,480
that you can take

1808
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,460
um to both shorten the flowering and to

1809
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,838
manage the canopy more evenly maybe we

1810
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,759
can get a little bit yeah please do

1811
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:48,719
people are going to be wanting those

1812
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,060
jobs

1813
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,439
well so I would say that if you have the

1814
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,000
ability if you're not a commercial

1815
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:56,759
grower even if you are and you have the

1816
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,219
ability to sacrifice a space for a cycle

1817
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,960
in order to do final hunts I think

1818
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:03,539
that's the way to do it

1819
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,159
um the idea of you know stabilizing

1820
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:07,140
Pinos and also you're going to be

1821
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:09,119
dealing with the intersex traits that

1822
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:12,060
are common in the Landry's Gene pools of

1823
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,019
Asia yeah and so you know breeding with

1824
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,780
those can be a bit of a challenge

1825
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:18,360
however doing Mass selections you know

1826
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:21,119
hunts based on big amounts then putting

1827
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:24,359
your your cuttings from select mothers

1828
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:27,119
directly into flower in small pots with

1829
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:29,639
a high planting density you can turn

1830
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,439
pretty pretty fast cycles and you can

1831
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,000
get really good yields and so I would

1832
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,419
say if you have the ability to do so

1833
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,039
please attempt to follow this uh this

1834
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:41,420
path as it's probably the most

1835
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:44,600
commercially viable otherwise

1836
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:47,158
the Indian Land races from the Himalayas

1837
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,440
they're going to be somewhat shorter

1838
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:52,859
than the ties

1839
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:56,698
um the difference would be 24 to 20

1840
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:58,859
weeks or 20 to six weeks not huge but

1841
01:10:56,698 --> 01:11:00,719
still if you're if you're somebody who

1842
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:03,599
struggles to maintain the plant's health

1843
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:05,520
during long flowering periods then maybe

1844
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,620
you're looking you know to shorten that

1845
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,420
down a little bit you'll find that in

1846
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:11,698
the in the cultivars from higher

1847
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:14,819
altitude and from more northernly

1848
01:11:11,698 --> 01:11:17,158
locations in general your your Thai

1849
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:18,719
varietals your cambodians your laotians

1850
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:21,359
are going to be

1851
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:24,840
depending on you know you and your

1852
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:27,359
growth we've seen seven meter plants in

1853
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,699
the village in sagang in Myanmar so

1854
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,319
that's that's your upper limit

1855
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:35,099
um

1856
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:37,500
so generally speaking LST a lot of

1857
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:39,000
pruning a lot of cutting back topping

1858
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,679
Etc I think the techniques that can

1859
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,140
benefit you

1860
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:45,658
um if you have the ability to let the

1861
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:48,360
plants grow without any sort of topping

1862
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:50,099
they do respond better to them these

1863
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,859
plants are not used to being

1864
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,020
individually coddled their land race

1865
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:57,719
plants coming from huge Fields the

1866
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:59,219
farmers do not pay attention to single

1867
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,380
plant yeah

1868
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:03,420
fields are too far away too high up too

1869
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,739
remote Etc and so

1870
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:07,260
um you know they a lot of them will

1871
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:09,299
never ever have been talked before you

1872
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,159
know and we've seen that given the

1873
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:14,159
intersex traits being a little bit of an

1874
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:17,099
issue for some people uh if you have the

1875
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:19,738
ability to to not stress them out then

1876
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,960
you know don't stress them out

1877
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:24,238
um but at the same time you know we

1878
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,158
we're saying that in order to earn on

1879
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:29,039
the side of caution yeah my personal

1880
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:31,619
experience has been incredibly resistant

1881
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,000
hearty vigorous tolerant plants that

1882
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:35,279
basically take whatever you throw at

1883
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,960
them and I find it funny to contrast

1884
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,000
that with the image that a lot of people

1885
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,460
have as these really sort of finicky and

1886
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,439
difficult to grow plants like no not at

1887
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,658
all the opposite they're difficult to

1888
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,939
make them stop growing like you're

1889
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,500
you're trying to you're trying to manage

1890
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:51,178
them and that's that's that's a whole

1891
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,219
different new different set of problems

1892
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,679
basically I think a lot of that is for

1893
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:58,140
people trying to bring in stuff that's

1894
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,000
been acclimated to Thailand Outdoors to

1895
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,520
indoors and they just don't get it like

1896
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,738
they're trying to feed it you know GH

1897
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,300
nutrients like just

1898
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:07,439
stuffing it full of nutrients and stuff

1899
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,600
and that's not what a lot of these land

1900
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:10,979
races want they don't they don't respond

1901
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,260
well to that of course it'll make them

1902
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:14,519
finicky yeah yeah you know I think one

1903
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,640
place where the Cannabis industry is

1904
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,620
really far behind in regards to

1905
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,380
um in regards to the wine industry or

1906
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:26,099
other teeth is in terms of understanding

1907
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:29,760
soil compositions and minerals Etc

1908
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:32,520
um the you know clearly fertile loamy

1909
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,980
soils lots of water that is strong

1910
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,900
vegetative growth that is not what we're

1911
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:38,279
seeking to necessarily do especially

1912
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:39,899
with plants that have such a long

1913
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:41,939
flowering period and we're trying to

1914
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:44,219
reduce the overall cycle

1915
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:46,738
um in the wine industry for example we

1916
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:49,319
apply such techniques as partial root

1917
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:51,238
dehydration which would be which will

1918
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:53,840
serve to stress the plant in very

1919
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:56,339
tactical ways in order to induce

1920
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,199
specific physiological changes that we

1921
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,260
want to see in the plant's phytochemical

1922
01:13:58,198 --> 01:14:03,299
makeup right yeah chemical makeup

1923
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,739
um and so as far as that goes with these

1924
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,960
land races you'll find that they're not

1925
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:09,479
not growing in sort of like these

1926
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,219
beautiful pristine soils like you know

1927
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:12,718
like we're talking about like if we're

1928
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:14,039
in Cambodia a lot of the time this is

1929
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,658
going to be maybe a bit sad to hear

1930
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:17,219
these days

1931
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:18,960
um The Growers are no longer next to the

1932
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:22,140
Mekong on sort of floodplain areas

1933
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,060
they're they're in freshly deforested

1934
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:27,060
rainforest which is often been

1935
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:29,699
deforested for Timber or sometimes

1936
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,860
specifically for growing cannabis

1937
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:34,339
um and so in that regards the jungle

1938
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:37,619
soils are often very very poor

1939
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:41,539
in Parvati Valley we see totally

1940
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:45,479
degraded soils from overuse of urea

1941
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:47,219
and very very very acidic soils on the

1942
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:49,319
bottom of slopes where everything's sort

1943
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:52,198
of draining down and accumulating and

1944
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:55,198
the plants are still thriving

1945
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:56,698
um relatively um yeah we've got

1946
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:00,178
different criteria here too when you're

1947
01:14:56,698 --> 01:15:01,678
growing 25 acres on a hillside it

1948
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,719
doesn't really matter if you have one or

1949
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,560
two plants that are a little bit raggedy

1950
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:05,880
looking

1951
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,500
um especially right

1952
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,600
no one's ever going to see the flower

1953
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,100
it's going to get robbed anyway so yeah

1954
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,800
it's a little bit of a different

1955
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,300
concerns in that regard

1956
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,820
that makes sense

1957
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,400
um yeah the way we treat plants in the

1958
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:22,859
U.S compared to these big massive Fields

1959
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,599
is night and day different uh we're just

1960
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:26,479
modeling them it's cute you know yeah

1961
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,640
all right

1962
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,959
taking care of your babies and for

1963
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,699
people that are worried about intersex

1964
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,260
traits and stuff just remember like

1965
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:35,579
anything if you're watching this

1966
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,219
anything

1967
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:40,079
intersex like any other trait in

1968
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:44,100
cannabis whether it's purple whether

1969
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,719
it's a scent it can be bred out or bred

1970
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,280
in you know I mean this is something

1971
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,198
that can be selected for or selected

1972
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,539
again so you're a little scared of

1973
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:55,579
things like that it's it's very easy to

1974
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:55,579
work out yeah well yes yeah

1975
01:15:56,859 --> 01:16:02,219
[Music]

1976
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:05,279
I agree about patterns of cultivation

1977
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:07,920
um including periods of time where many

1978
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:10,259
males are being called before reverting

1979
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,119
to Total open pollination for a few

1980
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,739
decades for example

1981
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:16,260
um that'll be enough to bring out

1982
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:18,419
intersex traits in your population sure

1983
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:20,100
um and if you're talking about you know

1984
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,199
hypothetical land race which has been

1985
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,659
growing on a hillside or maybe that's a

1986
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,519
bad example on a flood plain for a long

1987
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:28,379
time there will be maybe a little

1988
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,780
portion of the field that's

1989
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:34,079
raised above the water the water level

1990
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:35,579
and so you know every again this is

1991
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,219
totally hypothetical scenario I'm just

1992
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:40,019
making up sure here every you know maybe

1993
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:44,100
60 years you've got some catastrophic

1994
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:46,800
plots and once every cycle of floods

1995
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:49,320
they happen to kill all the males yeah

1996
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,600
literally every single one if the plant

1997
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:54,119
or the population did not have the

1998
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,579
intersect traits within it then that

1999
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:58,800
population would just disappear

2000
01:16:56,579 --> 01:17:01,140
um with the flood correct and so it's a

2001
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,600
survival mechanism that's found in large

2002
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,880
cannabis populations and so it just goes

2003
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,219
hand in hand with land races but

2004
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,199
especially with land races that have

2005
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:11,819
gone through periods of intense

2006
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:14,579
cultivation

2007
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:17,219
um or which are being grown according to

2008
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:20,399
the the modern sort of breeding

2009
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:22,859
practices of separating males and

2010
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,179
it makes sense that's some good context

2011
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:26,460
to add to it

2012
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:28,380
so is there any other strains you want

2013
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,239
to talk about or get into

2014
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,500
um before we wrap it up like because I

2015
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:33,299
want I want to be able to point people

2016
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,500
to some specific stuff they could check

2017
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:37,140
out on your site is there something

2018
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,399
other than what we've mentioned sure

2019
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,260
well we talked about the sort of the

2020
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:41,759
easier to approach ones

2021
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,440
um which again I don't think that

2022
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,119
there's you know maybe necessarily a

2023
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,460
huge difference in the in the skill

2024
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,960
curve acquired sure but I will say that

2025
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:53,100
kronkravio

2026
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:55,079
um cronkravia is the reputed to be you

2027
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:57,840
know the most potent the strongest of

2028
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:59,819
all the the land race is grown in in

2029
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,279
territory of Thailand

2030
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:04,380
um and it's it's a wonderful it's a

2031
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:06,960
wonderful kind of a succession

2032
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:09,060
um we we see phenotypes that are really

2033
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,539
really resonance with a sort of

2034
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:15,120
fermented sticky Sweet Lemon character

2035
01:18:12,539 --> 01:18:18,420
which I very personally fond of it

2036
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:20,340
reminds me of my experiences with

2037
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:23,579
um cannabis from Amsterdam in the late

2038
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:26,340
90s with amnesia hazes which have this

2039
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:28,920
sort of a incense the incensey kind of

2040
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:31,619
lemon character the best friend kravia

2041
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:35,219
expresses itself along those lines and

2042
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:38,399
it's very very potent it grows with a

2043
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:41,579
pretty unique uh bud structure which I

2044
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:44,099
think will take a lot of You by surprise

2045
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:45,359
um it's it might if you look at it if

2046
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,100
you look at it from far away it looks

2047
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:49,079
like a totally normal cannabis plant you

2048
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:51,420
look at it close up looks a little bit

2049
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:54,238
more like a mutant the the bud structure

2050
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,460
very loose and open and that allows for

2051
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:59,099
the UVS to penetrate you know deep

2052
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,658
inside and so it

2053
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:03,420
it's

2054
01:19:00,658 --> 01:19:06,539
it's rare to find sedative narcotic

2055
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:08,119
cannabis due in in Southeast Asia due to

2056
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:10,319
the long growing period

2057
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:12,359
where the trichomes are taking a long

2058
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:15,179
time to ripen but we found that on the

2059
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:17,039
cronkravia there's there's you know such

2060
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:18,480
penetration all the way in that we're

2061
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:21,658
seeing quite a high amount of photo

2062
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:23,759
oxidation and so if you cut it at the

2063
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:26,099
right time it's got this clear bright

2064
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,960
racy cerebral high but if you let it go

2065
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,940
all the way which can be as long as 28

2066
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,859
weeks you'll definitely see a lot of

2067
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:33,779
really dark colored trichomes in a much

2068
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:35,399
more narcotic sedative effect and

2069
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:37,679
personally I've really enjoyed both

2070
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:40,619
expressions of the of the krunkravia in

2071
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,960
that regards otherwise the Thai mango is

2072
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:44,880
like you know everybody loves mango it's

2073
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,980
such a Delicious Fruit

2074
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,980
um and you know the mango expressions in

2075
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:52,979
in Asia whether that's you know mysuru

2076
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:55,678
or high or Cambodian mango or whatever

2077
01:19:52,979 --> 01:20:00,479
else they range from the sort of the

2078
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:03,899
green mentholated camphor mango blue to

2079
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:06,419
the or ripe red juicy mangoes and people

2080
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:08,579
price different things generally if it's

2081
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:11,219
called mamuan which is mango and Thai

2082
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:13,140
it's going more for the ripe mango

2083
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:14,579
Spectrum as the green rainbow is

2084
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,520
something that's more commonly found

2085
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:19,800
across the board in Southeast Asia in

2086
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,140
we've seen a lot basically

2087
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:25,020
it's the right angle that sort of really

2088
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,340
valued and prized as far as that goes

2089
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,620
the

2090
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,079
lowland areas where mango traditionally

2091
01:20:28,619 --> 01:20:33,960
was grown and selected are pretty much

2092
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:35,640
overrun and so we our accessions in the

2093
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,800
north of the country around Chiang Mai

2094
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,219
with some smaller Growers doing open

2095
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:43,500
pollinations in in the sticks only like

2096
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:46,198
80 to 100 150 kilometers outside the

2097
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:48,960
city and one of them one of the groups

2098
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:52,979
is a Hmong group in DOI in tanon the

2099
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:54,960
tallest Mount Chiang Mai and not only is

2100
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:57,119
it one of the most stunningly beautiful

2101
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,920
places that if you just if you could

2102
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,539
picture yourself smoking weed from that

2103
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,819
place in that place it's really just

2104
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:05,420
have an honor

2105
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:07,439
but the Thai mango from this

2106
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:09,539
due to the altitude in the cold

2107
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:11,399
temperatures which is not that cold in

2108
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:13,500
Thailand but a few thousand meters a

2109
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,379
thousand feet gets a bit nippy comes

2110
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:19,560
across really purple and so we we used

2111
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:22,739
to back in the day sell that as the the

2112
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:25,380
Thai purple mango and the selling out

2113
01:21:22,738 --> 01:21:26,819
like that every single time so we

2114
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,020
actually just took the purple out the

2115
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:30,420
name because we wanted people to try

2116
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:32,760
other stuff you know yeah

2117
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:34,920
but yeah you you probably should check

2118
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,300
out the time angle if uh if that's your

2119
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,579
thing if you like purple colors

2120
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:41,100
otherwise we made some selections from

2121
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:44,340
Individual black plants in Parvati

2122
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:47,159
Valley namely in Iran

2123
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,800
um also in Tosh I think Tosh is really

2124
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:52,619
the two to look out for the shoran and

2125
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:56,279
[ __ ] Fields they're really high altitude

2126
01:21:52,619 --> 01:22:00,719
Fields above the Tosh kutla and you know

2127
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:04,019
there we we saw maybe like one plant in

2128
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:07,260
10 showing any coloration one plant 100

2129
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:09,780
showing significant and then one in a

2130
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:12,060
thousand being like pure black or dark

2131
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:14,819
maroon red kind of purple and so those

2132
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,560
plants we made selections from and we

2133
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:18,179
separated those out so if you're looking

2134
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,560
to Fino hunt

2135
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:21,420
um you know those are going to provide

2136
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,360
you you know a slightly better chance

2137
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:26,039
than the general population

2138
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:28,198
um which is which which one specifically

2139
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:29,519
is that

2140
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:30,839
um well maybe I'll just explain to you

2141
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,640
how we split up so we got the general

2142
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,560
populations which are from you know

2143
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,960
we've asked the farmers to basically

2144
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,060
they say mix all this that's actually

2145
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,198
what they do by standard they rub plants

2146
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,760
from all the fields and they sit in

2147
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:43,319
their house and a little pile of seed

2148
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,420
accumulates below them and we ask them

2149
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:48,779
just to sort through it to clean it out

2150
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:50,940
Etc sure the selections is either us or

2151
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:52,979
like members of our team or the Farmers

2152
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:54,899
making selections so it's like a village

2153
01:22:52,979 --> 01:22:56,879
selection then that that's just when

2154
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:57,899
we've gone there for two three days for

2155
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,640
example

2156
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:01,379
um we're going and looking for all the

2157
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,420
best plants that we can

2158
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,219
um and putting the side the seeds aside

2159
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,440
for those apart from the general

2160
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:09,239
population and then there's the single

2161
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:12,000
plant selections which you'll see or

2162
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:13,500
sorry the the Leo D we need to figure

2163
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,880
out an English word for this I don't

2164
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,579
know what it should be man but in French

2165
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,300
it's Beauty it's like the climate it's

2166
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:22,920
like the plot the plot is such a clumsy

2167
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,039
word it's not very romantic you know

2168
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,359
yeah right so I don't know we need to

2169
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:29,939
talk about the word for that but yeah so

2170
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:32,698
the the plot selections are obviously

2171
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:33,960
selections made from Individual plots

2172
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:35,819
um you know as I said before we're

2173
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,460
encouraging the farmers to rub from

2174
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:39,840
Individual fields and to tell their

2175
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,399
customers the name of the fields that

2176
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,619
they're rubbing from as a way to

2177
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:45,479
increase the value of the product

2178
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:47,099
um and so we're making selections from

2179
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:50,939
those two and then the individual plants

2180
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:52,560
and so for example it'll be like um the

2181
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:55,559
Tosh goodla which is the name of the

2182
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,980
village and then shorang the name of the

2183
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:01,739
of the of the garden and then the black

2184
01:23:58,979 --> 01:24:03,718
selection and so you know that's your

2185
01:24:01,738 --> 01:24:06,079
your single plant selection from from

2186
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:06,079
the going

2187
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,719
that's awesome to make all of them

2188
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:11,600
available so people actually have a

2189
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:14,060
choice you know

2190
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,679
well well well well well well well

2191
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:18,900
subscribers and patreons get first dibs

2192
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:20,219
so let's talk about this real quick um

2193
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:23,039
because I didn't even know this was a

2194
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:24,960
thing and I'm gonna join myself I went

2195
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:26,819
and bought seeds from you before we ever

2196
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,439
spoke because I was so stoked about this

2197
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:30,000
and like the purchases from the site go

2198
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:35,339
to the farmers which is super important

2199
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:36,960
to me and and Noble as can be and and I

2200
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:39,480
commend you for it

2201
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,158
um but the patreon thing I want to join

2202
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:44,039
so let's talk about some of that

2203
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:45,539
so yeah well basically the we talked a

2204
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:47,760
lot about incentivizing the communities

2205
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:50,039
the way to do that is to you know as we

2206
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,960
said to sell their seats and to get them

2207
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:53,579
paid for it and so yeah

2208
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,039
um you know given that a lot of what we

2209
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:58,019
do is touching on social issues ones

2210
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:00,000
that you know deal a lot heavily with

2211
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:01,920
with class with race with the

2212
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,779
colonialism Etc

2213
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,699
um and given that there was a need for

2214
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:07,619
for me as a foreigner and for a couple

2215
01:25:05,698 --> 01:25:10,619
of other foreigners to do administrative

2216
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:12,960
slash communication roles

2217
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:14,698
um we felt that it wasn't right to you

2218
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,579
know take us take a cut out of the seed

2219
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:19,439
sales and so instead what we set up was

2220
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:21,658
um a patreon program and a subscription

2221
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:24,238
program on the website and you know

2222
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:26,698
during the course of our work

2223
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:28,919
um we you know myself personally when

2224
01:25:26,698 --> 01:25:30,178
I'm traveling all you know for example

2225
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,300
if I'm accessing the general population

2226
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:35,100
I'm going to go go see some go see the

2227
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,840
village and go pick up a restock on on

2228
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,400
the general Pub a few others there's

2229
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,400
going to be like maybe along the way

2230
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:44,279
some Uncle who's like yo seeds here and

2231
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:45,779
there and that stuff that we can't it's

2232
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:47,460
not we because we're not in the business

2233
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:49,380
of doing reproductions right like yeah

2234
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:51,000
yeah we don't get seeds from the hill

2235
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,980
tribes or whatever and then grow them

2236
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,800
out in Bangkok no no it's directly yeah

2237
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:56,879
so we almost you know I mean I have my

2238
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,159
own grow

2239
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,960
um but I have so many things so we're

2240
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:02,819
like okay so we're gonna get these these

2241
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,560
small quantities the rarest stuff and

2242
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:05,399
that's going to be for for the Nerds you

2243
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,679
know for the people who are really

2244
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:09,599
passionate and who want basically you

2245
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,819
know hand selected

2246
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,699
um seeds from from people who are

2247
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:16,019
currently and actively sourcing in the

2248
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:18,059
traditional growing regions you know

2249
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:21,120
hand selected point of origin seeds and

2250
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:23,699
so yeah that allows us to to draw an

2251
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:26,880
income which allows us to do the

2252
01:26:23,698 --> 01:26:28,799
recruiting work to bring new you know

2253
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,239
groups or communities into the

2254
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,159
collective

2255
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,678
um and so it's it's working with a lot

2256
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:37,439
of synergy and

2257
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:39,119
yeah maybe we're not the best at keeping

2258
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,039
all the social media up to date which is

2259
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,960
probably why a lot of you guys might not

2260
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:45,479
have heard of us until now

2261
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,819
um but we definitely you know we we hold

2262
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:49,439
it down with the seeds and you know I

2263
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:51,059
feel like everybody involved is

2264
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,319
satisfied with the amount of genetics

2265
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:54,719
that we're that they're getting from us

2266
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:57,059
we're we're doing our best to stand by

2267
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:00,600
our people you know ultimately doing

2268
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,820
solid by the traditional indigenous land

2269
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,079
race Community growing communities in

2270
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:06,479
some ways

2271
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,738
um takes bread out of people's mouth in

2272
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,138
the west

2273
01:27:07,738 --> 01:27:13,979
um and so we you know we want to be sort

2274
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:16,079
of as as as honest and as helpful

2275
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:19,259
um with people in the west you know to

2276
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:21,119
give them you know as much of a room at

2277
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:23,039
the table as as we can you know because

2278
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:26,219
at the end of the day

2279
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:28,619
we see this as as a

2280
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:31,380
a way to form new connections and new

2281
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,760
Bridges between the communities in

2282
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,380
different countries you know we're so

2283
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,000
disconnected right now

2284
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:38,579
um and with integration I think we would

2285
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,260
all benefit right yeah I I would think

2286
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:42,420
so I mean that's what this is all about

2287
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:45,000
in the end for for us and it's why we

2288
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,739
started The Syndicate and yeah

2289
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,420
I mean it's you guys are doing your

2290
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:51,419
thing on the other side and hopefully

2291
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:53,219
you know we were talking even uh more

2292
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:54,840
recently about

2293
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,698
um The Strain database we're building

2294
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,319
and stuff so hopefully even we can

2295
01:27:56,698 --> 01:27:59,939
continue to collaborate on stuff like

2296
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:03,059
that like I've asked you to help with

2297
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:04,738
the uh land race portion of our strain

2298
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:06,600
database that we're building that I'm

2299
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:09,479
really super stoked about to have

2300
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:11,760
something accurate and uh yeah there's

2301
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:14,339
all kinds of fun collaborations that we

2302
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,840
can do and reach out and some of it to

2303
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:18,000
some people seems like pie in the sky

2304
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:22,260
stuff but I think we can accomplish a

2305
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,880
lot I agree it's time for for a little

2306
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,199
bit of time to come out of the Shadows a

2307
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,239
little bit

2308
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:29,460
um you know particular countries like

2309
01:28:27,238 --> 01:28:32,099
Indonesia with a rich tradition of

2310
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,439
cannabis are very very very oppressive

2311
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,940
and so it's not for lack of want you

2312
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:37,859
know we we you know people have always

2313
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:40,500
wanted to perform these legs and

2314
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:43,859
collaborate but now the time feels right

2315
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:45,359
and you know and so if if we can you

2316

2317
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:50,759
some someone make a name for themselves

2318
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:52,979
by reading the next Cannabis Cup winner

2319
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,900
um from final hunting some Landry's gene

2320
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:56,099
pool they access through us you know

2321
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:58,379

2347

it's your second viewing we ask a gentle

2350
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:07,679
person's agreement that you click the

2351
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,960
Subscribe button it costs you nothing
