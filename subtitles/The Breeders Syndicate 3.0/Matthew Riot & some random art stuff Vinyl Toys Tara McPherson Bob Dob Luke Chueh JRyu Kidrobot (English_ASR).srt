1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,040
hey everyone so the past few weeks I've

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,660
been showing some of the art and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,120
different toys and stuff my collection

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,179
as I've been rearranging our whole house

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,480
and uh trying to put everything together

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,679
from the last move you know and um I

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,300
just figured I'd share some of it

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,759
because I think most of the stuff people

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,699
don't get to see and I take no claim to

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,220
ownership of any of this so yeah don't

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,560
use it against me anywhere anyway

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,979
um this one I put up earlier this was a

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,420

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,420

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,320
and as you can see I've been trying to

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,620

favorites of all time

58
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,199
all right

59
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,539
um

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,280
oh I think one of the picks

61
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,539
one of the picks from the Chiefs if

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,239
you're a punk rock fan that's kind of

63
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:24,419
cool right we have um some stuff from

64
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,219
Chris rainiac and Amanda Louise Spade I

65
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,079
don't remember which one did these in

66
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,340
particular usually you can see a little

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,860
bit of the difference in their Styles

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,739
that's Amanda

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,739
should be raining maybe it's Amanda

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,420
it's so hard to tell Chris swariniak I

71
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,979
think is definitely a rainy app right

72
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,839
here

73
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,018
and these are like uh

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,180
special edition Prince I think of some

75
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,920
sort they're thick

76
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,019
and then these ones I have several of

77
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,958
them so most of them are frame them from

78
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:01,800
riniak and I just you

79
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,439
yeah I'm weird I even like Q [ __ ] just

80
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,360
don't tell anyone still tough

81
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,539
there's an old flyer from one of their

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,280

83
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,280

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,140
art from the Deftones

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,878
I love his stuff especially as rabbits

86
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,259
like holding each other hostage so my

87
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,439
favorite part

88
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:24,318
move that so you can't see anything

89
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,878
lewd lascivious

90
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,458

91
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,139

101
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,219
saying like hey if you're interested in

102

103
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,199

and these this is like stuff in hand and

108
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,098
then there's a certificate authenticity

109
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,019
too

110
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:12,719
which is okay

111
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,120
um here's an old original Peter Max

112
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,040
envelope from the 60s or 70s I'm not

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,180
sure which they're probably 60s and 60s

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,459
early 70s

115
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,860
oh Expo 74.

116
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,720
there you go

117
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,139
um

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,340
autographed Brief Encounters I don't

119
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,978
know whatever

120
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,138
I really I really admired Luke and his

121
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:38,959
work um I have seen one of these boxes

122
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,960
right here is one of his um bears but

123
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,699
the guy guy wasn't terribly nice I mean

124
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,620
like I spent a lot of money on his stuff

125
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,180
and we're trying to you know you always

126
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
want to connect with people and there's

127
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,060
just no way to connect with this dude

128
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,680
for me so

129
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,759
it kind of ruined a lot of the art for

130
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,139
me

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,580
anyway

132
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,840
um

133
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,839

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,040
she uses and the my first style her

137
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,779
whole style is beautiful everything she

138
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,520
does

139
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,519
I like her her perspective

140
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,599
let's see I'm going to Tara McPherson

141
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,600

I need to get these in frames I don't

148
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,859
know what they're doing out of the frame

149
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,138
can sign that one this one's probably

150
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,400
signed to I would think

151
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,400
maybe not

152
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,019
back but it's one of my favorites you

153
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,500

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,699
that I have in the big one I think it's

171
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,359
uh I don't know it's probably a print

172
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,960
another Fox what else we got

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,960
this is a coin

174
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,240
little punk rocker this is cool it's

175
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,899
like the it's a newspaper

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,120
for the Mouseketeer Army and like these

177
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,799
statues are some of my favorite statues

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,699
ever and two of them broke in the

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,199
earthquake that we had and then I

180
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,520
ordered them right after we moved and

181
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,900
they got shipped to the wrong house to

182
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,219
replace them so I just never got them

183
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,439
again

184
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,860
yeah that's a bummer because I

185
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:23,038
absolutely loved um yeah they're still

186
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,160
kind of broken that's just that

187
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,219
