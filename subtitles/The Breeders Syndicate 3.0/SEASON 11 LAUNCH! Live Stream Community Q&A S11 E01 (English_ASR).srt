52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,840
it Mr

53
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,719
Dan you're

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,840
muted uh I just took some rips of the

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,919
wet dream the Green Crack times blue

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,479
dream and that [ __ ] was fire so shout

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:27,639
out to screw for send sending that

58
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,639
out about you than that oh yeah um I've

59
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:34,559
been sampling my freshly Harvest Santa

60
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,079
Cruz RS so I've got four of them um and

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,840
two of them I mean again just visually

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,840
purely visually look a lot more Blue

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,959
Dream than the other two but you know I

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,200
think profile wise there's definitely a

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,080
quite quite the mix across them so still

66
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,639
getting used to them but uh one of

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,519
them's got a killer he Buzz which I love

68
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,878
for the daytime so I'll probably be no I

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,480
I don't know that I've ever talked about

70
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,359
why I'm not smoking on our show um but I

71
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,759
got sick with something that people have

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,080
been arguing about ever since I brought

73
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,719
it up cannaboid hyperemesis I think it's

74
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,840
s supposed to be pronounced like hyperic

75
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:14,199
right local maybe Science Guy uh I'm not

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,920
a medicine guy man I don't know

77
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,158
hyperic Hy emesis syndrome which makes

78
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,399
you uh essentially you you flood your

79
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:25,798
canabo system so much that it makes you

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,640
uh throw up non-stop until you either

81
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,920
die or quit smoking and it it shows up

82
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,158
quite a bit so I had to stop smoking and

83
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,559
it's supposed to be for supposedly 11

84
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,280
months if you're a lifetime smoker uh to

85
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,158
completely flush it out so you can smoke

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,080
again so that's why my Hiatus exists but

87
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,639
it's been fun um shucking stuff and not

88
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,439
being able to smoke it it's been quite a

89
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:51,679
treat uh the SHP cream pie seem very

90
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:54,400
nice I mean it like uh it's very greasy

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
resin and it makes a lot of greasy resin

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,680
people like opposed to the Sandy so

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,878
that's about all I got to say on the

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,920
smoke front kind of sucks

95
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,798
um Matt did you want to kick us off with

96
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,518
Al some of the Tas us some of the drops

97
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,159
that are happening okay so we have uh my

98
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,560
drop we have uh uh packs drop uh Santa

99
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,959
Cruz go form and we have high and

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,759
loansome drop so my drop's going to be I

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,959
call it Viva la bluevolution which is

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,680
just it's the blueberry in crosswork or

103
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,439
as it's written um which is a totally

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,639
madeup term for cannabis but it it fits

105
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,079
because you need a term for something

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,199
like Crossing in between Generations as

107
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,719
as opposed to going straight

108
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,280
generational

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,440
work so you know like there's there's a

110
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,198
backat cross in there at some point and

111
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,759
and reading back to DJ shorts blue so we

112
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,319
have the blueberry incross which was my

113
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,720
most popular from the original Blue

114
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,599
Bonnet release and that was DJ shorts

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,160
blue b or blueberry uh F4 from an old

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,080
pack that I selected cross to the blue

117
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,080
bonnet of course and what it did was

118
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,198
take all the looks from DJ shorts

119
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,439
blueberry which is probably some of its

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
most

121
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,439
awesome part of its traits is the looks

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,800
because it's beautiful purple cushy

123
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,639
looking stuff and cross that to the Blue

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
pond it so it injected heavy blueberry

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,478
TPS into it so it was kind of what I

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,880
always imagined the pictures of of like

127
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:16,560
when I was buying seeds at DJ Short

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,759
Stuff it's how I imagine those things

129
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,079
growing out smelling like blueberry

130
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,240
looking like that and that's that's what

131
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,198
I reimagined with this and it worked out

132
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,079
really well um so we we redid that and

133
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,720
then we crossed that to Mac Daddy which

134
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,519
I have no idea what mac daddy is but it

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
looks like a better version of Mac one

136
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,198
um well it smells like a bubble gummy

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,000
Mac one to be honest I don't know what's

138
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,919
in it um that that's like clone only

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,079
type I don't know um we have blue cocky

140
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,159
which is a new

141
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:51,478
name Dan came up with for the sherb

142
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,680
cream pie cross to uh the blueberry and

143
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,240
cross and I'm pretty stoked on that one

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,240
it's fat chunky sherb um a little louder

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,800
than normal

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,000
sherb um but yeah like I mean there's a

147
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,960
cut out there called Blue sherb that

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,439
everybody was all stoked on when it came

149
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,079
out I was too I was like wow this this

150
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,079
sounds pretty good and then tried it and

151
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,399
it wasn't really blue at all so kind of

152
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,120
wanted to reimagine that one uh blamy

153
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,959
which is the white runs blueberry and

154
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,598
cross which again smells like it's it's

155
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,079
a lot smaller yielding version of the

156
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:24,918
Sher cream pie and then the the trop doy

157
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,198
blueberry and cross which really is like

158
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:31,159
a a Tangi dominant uh cookies blueberry

159
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,038
and cross so basically it's um kind of

160
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,120
leaning into the hype crowd a little bit

161
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,120
to try to get some injection of Interest

162
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,399
into what we do in the first place and

163
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,680
as it were like thousand said maybe a

164
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,638
trojan horse style attack

165
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,160

so Sol assassin number one OG which is a

185
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,199
cut I held for years it's a really

186
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,080
really dank old OG cut it's probably a

187
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,720
hybrid it grows way better than OG you

188
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,680
never needed to stake it um super OG and

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,000
turps almost like Irene but it's just a

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
way better growing plant than any OG um

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,759

I I don't remember the list I need to

220

221
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,559
one there's

222
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:13,559
a I think I want to say

223
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,559
eie

224
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,919
mango um yeah bunch of other ones that's

225
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,278
all regular stuff too so we've got a few

226
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,000
a few different regular seed drops and

227
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:27,159
one fem seed drop and uh for my next

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,399
drop it's going to be probably I think

229
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,278
we're going to do the blue and cross f

230
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,958
we're going to see we're going to see

231
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,159
where it takes us um that's the hopes

232
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,278
anyways but you can never bet the farm

233
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,199
on that stuff yeah

234
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,000
pretty there's another round of blue

235
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,680
drop right I mean another round of

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,799
there's another blue drop after this

237
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:48,239
right to come that we we may not leak

238
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:52,199
yet oh which which one's that I don't

239
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,879
know that blue oh yeah A5 A5 mango Haze

240
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,240
that was the other one oh yeah yeah

241
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,039
hopefully that one will work and come

242
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,278
out thank you G and then um we also have

243
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:07,039
the TGA crosses coming soon which is

244
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:10,320
like the the epitome of something that I

245
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,799
said I'd never do and never say

246
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,560
never yeah so that's going to be fun

247
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,919
that's going to be all the newer um bet

248
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,319
I think better moms that should have

249
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,240
been crossed to space dude personally

250
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,600
yeah that's gonna be coming very soon

251
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,680
too these are insane drops by the way

252
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,839
like all of them yeah they're pretty

253
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,958
good

254
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,000
stoked I don't have enough space or

255
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:36,479
money for this [ __ ] yeah me either I

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,320
know all right what's next on the agenda

257
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,360
well we can start off with some of the

258
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,680
questions so the first one um which

259
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,720
we've had before I think but let's go

260
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,399
over it again so Diggy effects asks I'd

261
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,519
love to hear more about mother plant

262
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,679
maintenance especially in Solo cups

263
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,639
maybe we can expand that to say mother

264
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,799
plants in smaller containers all right I

265
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,959
I could I could start with this one uh

266
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,799
mother plants in smaller containers the

267
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,399
main thing you're going to run into is

268
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,719
like mold

269
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,799
PM bugs because you have a lot more Leaf

270
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,440
in a smaller area because if you're

271
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,359
using the stuff in a smaller area you're

272
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,360
topping you're training you're cramming

273
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,000
as much as you can into a tiny scale um

274
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
so yeah IPM has to be on track uh air

275
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,078
movement has to be on track um a lot of

276
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,200
times people like to use and I know this

277
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,519
is like absurd nowadays but t5s lower

278
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,959
light if you're in a smaller environment

279
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,078
to to induce like slower growing as

280
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,559
opposed to like decreasing health for

281
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,719
slower growing decreased light for

282
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,958
slower growing if that makes sense um

283
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,160
that was one of our big tricks back in

284
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,559
the day keeping you know 100 moms in a

285
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,679
small space was using e5s and uh light

286
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,879
like light raising lights and lowering

287
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,759
lights as they go up and down and yeah

288
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,360
that was the main thing um I don't know

289
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,360
what else you guys

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,600
got

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,078
um I would say probably the biggest

292
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,240
thing is the thing that Matt mentioned

293
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:06,319
in my at least in my situation cuz that

294
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,360
helps like mitigate how much growth

295
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,600
you're going to get and like once you

296
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,879
start getting that many moms it just

297
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:20,240
becomes a lot to manage um but also like

298
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:22,838
me in my case I also uh do um cocoa only

299
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,839
uh so I have to water and feed like

300
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,240
every single watering and like if I do

301
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,399
my plants are going to fall over because

302
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,278
like the weight of the plant is just

303
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,000
like too too much for the kind of the

304
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:40,159
width of the pot

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,198
um let's see I also do uh racks racks

306
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:48,078
help me a lot um that's I mean you could

307
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:50,240
double your area with that easily um

308
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,559
let's see what else

309
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,120
um I mean yeah just keep your plant your

310
00:12:53,559 --> 00:13:00,719
moms like well fed well like well

311
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,639
watered

312
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
um I had a question about this as well

313
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,799
uh is there any sense

314
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,078
in with mothers like do you keep the

315
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,559
lights as intense as you would for

316
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,359
plants that you're growing out to crop

317
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:19,359
no um yeah I I give them less light just

318
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,278
in general like less intense

319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,720
light what about

320
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,679
feeding I feed him every time they need

321
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,360
a lot they need heavy food in pots yeah

322
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:34,479
I mean they're getting the same feed as

323
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:37,079
my like plants and flower um so yeah I

324
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,399
don't I don't really reduce diet or

325
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,679
change diet for them too much you got to

326
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,278
keep it

327
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,759
consistent yeah Kyle's right constantly

328
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,278
taking Cuts constantly taking Cuts

329
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,720
that's another good way to keep it lows

330
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,838
I mean it's essentially the same thing

331
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,680
as topping in many sense or many sense

332
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,079
the same way same achieves the same

333
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,399
thing as topping but it's a huge

334
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:57,958
important part of the process especially

335
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,919
if you're keeping a lot of moms and

336
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,359
you're doing like a strain library to

337
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,078
keep stuff alive you have to take lots

338
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
of cuts because [ __ ] dies as you keep

339
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,679
them smaller it's just part of the

340
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,759
number scale yeah and that turnover just

341
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,439
helps keep them small too it's like if

342
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,159
you're cutting it every you know four to

343
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,839
six weeks and restarting it then you

344
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,078
know you're going to constantly pretty

345
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,320
much have like a SE six or seven inch

346
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,838
clone up to like you know a foot or two

347
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,920
tall and then it immediately goes back

348
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,600
to a clone and so it's a ton of work but

349
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,719
that's that's how I do it or try to do

350
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,000
it I'm behind right now I've got some

351
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,199
clone trays that are like 2 feet

352
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,039
tall you know that that was another

353
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,599
trick I used to use and I don't I mean I

354
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,319
don't know if I recommend this or not or

355
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,120
don't recommend it it's something I did

356
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,240
um you know the 10 x 20 plastic Mii

357
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
trays or whatever like the thick ones I

358
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,959
put load those up with peite and I would

359
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,199
keep essentially like a hempy bucket for

360
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,719
a lack of a better term just peite and

361
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,479
water and keep the Clones in that or not

362
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,600
water but a feed and constantly water it

363
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,159
that way the problem with it is if it's

364
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,959
all different strains they overgrow each

365
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,799
other real fast some get like two feet

366
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,319
tall some stay four inches but I was

367
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,359
able to keep things in that for like two

368
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,920
months sometimes if I needed oh yeah it

369
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
would look like [ __ ] but it would it

370
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:14,599
would work it would function if you know

371
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,479
I mean oh I've got a tray of 50 yeah

372
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,120
that's like two months in the tray two

373
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,240
feet tall and I'm [ __ ] watering it

374
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,399
twice a day and I'm just like I I don't

375
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,278
have time to [ __ ] pot these up yet

376
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,240
but they're going in next I've saved

377
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,600
whole libraries that way just like

378
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,399
backing them up that way and that's like

379
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,800
a emergency scenario or if you're

380
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,600
feeling extra lazy or have very little

381
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,838
room it'll work um yeah it's just

382
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
essentially what it would be is uh Mii

383
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,920
tray peite and then one of those

384
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
skeleton trays you know you set clones

385
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,439
in that are open and just set the Clones

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
in there rock wool more perite water

387
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,800
that [ __ ] in and they'll go bananas in

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,198
it you know so yeah I mean I've seen sh

389
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,519
take off the flower in it you know well

390
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,359
and you can get groan of any size too so

391
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,679
you could like really easily just get

392
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,919
like the 3in cube oh yeah you know what

393
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,039
I mean and like they're kind of tall too

394
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,439
and so you could fit like 18 of those in

395
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:11,278
one of those 10 x 20s and just like keep

396
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,000
a little mini mom like that too you

397
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,078
know

398
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,799
underneath you're [ __ ] like the 50

399
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:20,159
even when I plugged it was just like oh

400
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,479
I'm gonna have to pop this down like

401
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,600
twice a day yeah guar it's gonna rot it

402
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,159
was nuts trying to do the 72 count I

403
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,680
mean but the tray was off at that point

404
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,600
but yeah I mean it was it was hell like

405
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,318
trying to keep used to do mini Cuts in

406
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,360
the you remember when uh Oasis cubes had

407
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,639
the the wedges and they were like the

408
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,879
102 count and the little plastic insert

409
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,039
yeah um yeah we used to cram little like

410
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,198
three-inch Cuts in those and like they

411
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,519
took an extra week to like really get

412
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,758
established but you know if they're all

413
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,679
just like stuff you would have thrown

414
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,278
away and you could sell clones back then

415
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,679
that was [ __ ] great yeah

416
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:59,838
dude I got I'm still working out a

417
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:03,559
system for my like tiny tiny shamefully

418
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,240
tiny space and I had like a got like a

419
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,279
one foot by one foot by like twoot

420
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,798
cabinet in which I there's like a shelf

421
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,289
in there and I stuffed like 25 plants in

422
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:16,038
there I can fit 72 in that

423
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:20,199
[Laughter]

424
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:21,879
spotu crazy dude yeah I mean just to

425
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,439
like keep my [ __ ] though like I cut two

426
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,919
full trays just for like the Dozen

427
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,400
things I'm holding on to CU I like to

428
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,880
take five or six of of each you know and

429
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,480
suddenly you have like you're just

430
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,960
throwing them all away you know what I

431
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,599
mean yeah you do throw a lot away that

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,120
way yeah it sucks but yeah it hurts

433
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,839
every time you're like oh this could be

434
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,918
you know like anything from an ounce to

435
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,678
a pound of weed and I'm just throwing it

436
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,120
away my buddy my buddy Chris assaro down

437
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,519
there he was um he does really nice

438
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,918
Living Water um it's it's I guess it

439
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:56,359
would be living water it's it's he has

440
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,679
worms uh he feeds water through that

441
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,519
through the worm castings that go

442
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,720
through that and I think fish [ __ ] in it

443
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:06,679
somehow right like like aquaponic thing

444
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,038
but like aqu ver vermiponics

445
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,400
he's growing some beautiful Punchy

446
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,640
plants that way absolutely sounds cool

447
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,080
yeah yeah it works really [ __ ] well

448
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,960
never heard living water though yeah lo

449
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,519
you gonna try uh you gonna try growing

450
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,558
plants out of your tanks

451
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,319
dude yeah yeah let the NES feed or the

452
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:27,759
yeah what are those little [ __ ] n

453
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,359
don't be a

454
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:34,158
[ __ ] be a [ __ ] you want n

455
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,519
water bro that's my compost te right

456
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,440
there there

457
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:42,960
you how well it works like with a fish

458
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,240
and just it's [ __ ] nuts

459
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,400
like locco told me that he has like a

460
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,640
shot of that water every

461
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,919
day makes it for life good for the gut

462
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,759
biome it was Gage green that used to

463
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,840
drink Willard's Water you remember

464
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,359
Willard's Water Dan

465
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:03,678
no area

466
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,479
weird [ __ ] and doubt it it was mud water

467
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,519
although he did say one thing that has

468
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,120
stuck with me for years I remember one

469
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,240
time that dude from Gage green was like

470
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,558
well I mean just think he was like

471
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,000
arguing in favor of veganism and he's

472
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,519
just like well think about it if you go

473
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,839
to a vegan restaurant you're probably

474
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,879
gonna want to [ __ ] a bunch of those

475
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,119
people but if you go to an Applebees how

476
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,760
many of those people do you really want

477
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,959
to [ __ ] good point I was like point

478
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,759
taken

479
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,240
bro stuck with me for like five years

480
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:34,038
now like chicks with Harry armpits we're

481
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,679
where you go bro see that that's what

482
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:39,000
that's what my book of poetry would be

483
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,000
right there yeah

484
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,399
right yeah yeah welcome to the live

485
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,400
stream

486
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,280
everyone I didn't say that [ __ ] I think

487
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,319
I think that was that was an actual

488
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,359
quote Yeah Jason whatever his name is

489
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,839
the the younger one the the older one is

490
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,279
the one that was a freak the Asian dude

491
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,720

492
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:03,038
that's Jason he's the younger he came

493
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,120
later um the old dude though he was I

494
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,359
think it was maybe fulvic water or

495
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,439
something yeah it was foul as [ __ ] it

496
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,279
was like kavak Cava or something you

497
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,960
know like mud water it was

498
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,879

567
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,799
not I'm dumb as [ __ ] I guarantee

568
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,599
you Merlin and Clark 2013 that was the

569
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,639
when I first read the Cannabis evolution

570
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,480
in

571
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,880
ethnobotany designs for clone racks and

572
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,798
[ __ ] the evolution in ethnobotany is

573
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,799
like a real college textbook for those

574
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,359
yeah that one's dank this is literally

575
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,960
like me designing my first tissue

576
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,479
culture lab you know what I mean and

577
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,000
like the phases and like different

578
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,519
equipment I need and [ __ ] how do I get

579
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that there we go I just remembered like

580
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,839
that's how I do it is like the lab

581
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,359
notebook's gritted out it's numbered

582
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,199
Pages you can like here's where I

583
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,759
designed a quality index for grading

584
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,120
pounds when I worked in

585
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,640
La grading pounds yeah because we had to

586
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,119
like grade pounds and know what to sell

587
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,960
them for and so like it's my whole

588
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,678
process of like giving it a like a score

589
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,000
basically well that's nice just so when

590
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,480
buyers like try to to push back on it be

591
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000

650
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,440
flowering this stuff I think this was a

651
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,278
run from bio Vortex it was his like

652

659
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,440
his time with [ __ ] you kind of have to

660
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,760
know him to get his seeds you know I

661
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,240
mean yeah that's kind of cool too though

662
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,038
yeah I met up with him in person and he

663
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,720
had this like cool chest you know what I

664
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:07,398
mean like this bag and he like pulling

665
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,679
out all these baggies and [ __ ] I just

666
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:12,079
like oh [ __ ] you're this is awesome this

667
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,960
is like visiting a seed bank in

668
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,759
person you know but not to be confused

669
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,440
with HSC who have has the best marketing

670
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,519
campaign on Earth what else do we got in

671
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,200
here I think that's it

672
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,798
really yeah here's me like mapping out

673
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,558
profits or potential profits you know

674
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:31,240
what I mean [ __ ] okay so we know Dan's

675
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,839
organized as [ __ ] how about you guys are

676
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,159
you guys organized too like this this is

677
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,079
insanity um honestly dude it's gotten to

678
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,120
the point where I just throw plants and

679
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:45,000
flower all the time that I don't know

680
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,839
like I just keep it track of when I

681
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,720
threw it into flower and that's about it

682
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,918
um I feel like everything I've grown I

683
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,798
can reference it in my

684
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,799
brain no I know where you're writing

685
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,398
know all the DMS and pictures on Discord

686
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,679
and stuff that those are those are kind

687
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,038
of notes as well I guess they are yeah

688
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,399
in some sense I use mine a lot actually

689
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,599
where I go back on like IG and I'm like

690
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:13,038
oh [ __ ] yeah okay I remember that now

691
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:15,038
and yeah pretty useful I'm at the point

692
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,839
where I use monkey at zoo like is my

693
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,480
strain index somehow he has EV he has a

694
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,439
list of every single strain I've ever

695
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,759
made from day one like that he keeps but

696
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,200
I have to reference that because I'm

697
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,640
like someone ask me something like I

698
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,278
don't [ __ ] know somehow he knows so

699
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,080
it's really cool that someone has that

700
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:36,119
because I I don't have that in my I used

701
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:40,119
to my brain isn't so good anymore though

702
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,119
long not a reliable tool

703
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,359
anymore what about

704
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,240
you the notes I think I yeah I also tend

705
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:49,959
to rely on IG when I first started

706
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,278
growing the forums were were good for

707
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,759
that obviously you had your own like

708
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:58,240
thread and you know you could obviously

709
00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:00,359
keep a lot of notes in there yeah and IG

710
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,038
you know like Dan was saying it's not

711
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,558
bad but it's not easy to search like you

712
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,119
don't have to manually scroll through

713
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:11,240
everything um to find what you want so

714
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,558
it's not ideal either um ideally I don't

715
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,000
know I could probably use a spreadsheet

716
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:18,119
if I wanted to I'm just I'm still not

717
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,319
there yeah my memory is good for strains

718
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,798
and what they were like descriptions

719
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:26,759
it's pretty accurate for that my own

720
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,480
strain names less accurate like what I

721
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,759
called something at certain points but I

722
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,000
like if someone tells me the cross I can

723
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,079
tell them exactly what it was like you

724
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,880
know remember that much but strain names

725
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:37,240
are harder so when you're making seeds

726
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,200
that's probably a good thing to keep a

727
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,319
list of there was one for a long time um

728
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,840
when uh speak sleazy took over the

729
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,639
website they deleted all that so that

730
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,439
was kind of it unless someone finds a

731
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,759
way to go back in time like monkey did

732
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,120
so shout out to him for the help with

733
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,759
that I will say that when I first

734
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,639
started growing one thing that helped me

735
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,960
was actually recording mistakes that I

736
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
was making in the earlier run cuz then

737
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,038
I'd be like oh that's right this thing

738
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,719
happened last time and I I'll try not to

739
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:06,599
do that again um now most of that

740
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,960
internalized but yeah at some point I

741
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,839
was tracking like fuckups basically yeah

742
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,200
I can't imagine you not keeping notes

743
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:17,798
bro as organized as you are C you

744
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,919
probably I'm super into archiving [ __ ]

745
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,240
for sure but you are too Matt like you

746
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,720
you do keep a lot of stuff too maybe not

747
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,000
notes but you know you're into archiving

748
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,679
yeah yeah I keep collections of [ __ ]

749
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,278
look at look at that's behind that right

750
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:37,038
now I'm watching to see if my my hasola

751
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:39,480
autograph on eBay goes for more than two

752
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,720
down to six minutes and at 1500 it's not

753
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,159
mine I'm not selling it I'm watching

754
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,519
someone

755
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,278
sell yeah I guess I'm the only old man

756
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,278
that still does it uh IRL in the hand

757
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,759
you

758
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:52,839
know but uh I don't know I think it gets

759
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:54,599
you back better back into the mindset

760
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,599
you were when you were doing that stuff

761
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,678
too you know what I mean CU like

762
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,798
instantly that took me back you know six

763
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,600
years oh sure I bet where it's just like

764
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,879
oh I know what I was thinking about you

765
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,959
know what I mean and the things that I

766
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,960
thought were important and like what I

767
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,720
know better now and so I think it's a

768
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,720
really good like reflective tool too to

769
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,720
see like how far you've

770
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,240
come okay what do we got nice next okay

771
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,480
so next we have a bunch we have a couple

772
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,720
of questions from

773
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,720
scrwen uh I Know Dan has a lot of

774
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,880
experience reversing plants local

775
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,960
gaining it Matt obviously right um could

776
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,080
you talk about some common mistakes uh

777
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,278
outside of the typical trying to reverse

778
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:38,759
a single

779
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,720
plant go ahead Dan I'll catch up at the

780
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:43,558
end I feel like it's all either maybe

781
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,639
local you go first local um Local's

782
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:49,638
fresh right yeah I actually I just did

783
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:53,000
my first one not too long ago so it's

784
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:56,000
it's still pretty fresh um but the first

785
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,359
piece of advice is don't uh reverse a

786
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,759
big ass plant that's what I did

787
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:06,038
yeah um and like my sweet pee by Nature

788
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:10,599
[ __ ] just grows insane um like at in

789
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:12,720
Sint rates um and then two do more than

790
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,359
one plant uh you never want to put all

791
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,960
your eggs in one

792
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,798
basket um and then another thing would

793
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,600
be

794
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:26,839
timing uh you kind of got to know um

795
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:29,278
when it's gonna throw balls you know

796
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,398
like I I I didn't know about when it

797
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,960
would and it just kind of did around two

798
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:36,079
and a half weeks is when I started

799
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,519
seeing balls but then they didn't really

800
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:42,278
open till a few weeks after that so like

801
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,240
the the timing thing is still a bit

802
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:48,159
confusing to me um but it's all like

803
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,519
trial and error I feel

804
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,240
like yeah I feel like it's like

805
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,120
literally all mistakes until you do I

806
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,558
don't know half a dozen or so and then

807
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,918
you kind of get your bearings a little

808
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:02,440
better um but I agree with everything

809
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,000
that Lok said it's like um timing is

810
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,480
super important because if you spray too

811
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,519
much it doesn't go well if you spray too

812
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,839
high a concentration it doesn't go well

813
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,880
if you spray too low a concentration and

814
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,839
so like knowing what you're working with

815
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,639
and kind of documenting that because I

816
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,720
was Dick to the wind when I started my

817
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:21,558
reversal journey and someone just told

818
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,720
me like yeah mix a few ounces of this

819
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:25,759
liquid with a few ounces of this liquid

820
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,159
and do it in this order and I had no

821
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:31,599
idea the concentrations I was using and

822
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,360
it did not work most of the time um and

823
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,759
it took me like three years really

824
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,319
because I wasn't buying commercial

825
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,319
sprays to kind of like figure out where

826
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,038
I actually wanted to be and like some

827
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,359
stuff's easy too like I was doing some

828
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:47,638
hemp work and CBD work and that [ __ ]

829
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:49,519
reverses really really easily and and so

830
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:51,079
you get this false sense of confidence

831
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,519
same thing with autof flowers I reversed

832
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:56,638
Autos after that and did some of that

833
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,159
work and that [ __ ] is super easy you

834
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:00,199
know what I mean at least this the low

835
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,080
riter stuff that I was working with was

836
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,360
like just went every time and so um then

837
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,239
you get into doing multiple different

838
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,838
types of clones and you start tripping

839
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,279
over your dick and you're just like uh

840
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:13,878
what the [ __ ] happened this has worked

841
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,879
every single time that I did this why

842
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,480
isn't it working now and then you kind

843
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:18,838
of realize like and that happens over

844
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,559
and over again you're like okay well I

845
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,119
don't like know what I'm doing at all

846
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,719
actually and so for me it was once I

847
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,039
started documenting concentrations

848
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,398
blending different concentrations and

849
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,440
like doing kind of just like basic

850
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,838
trials like that where I was like okay

851
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,119
well this is all almost always too much

852
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,799
you know what I mean this is damaging

853
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,079
the plant it's counterproductive and I'm

854
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,519
like the concentration and the frequency

855
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,240
is too much and so yeah timing is really

856
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:49,559
important concentration is important and

857
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,439
then uh knowing the plant that you have

858
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,719
is also like obviously part of it

859
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,079
because it's like if you don't know it's

860
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,480
like General flower rate then you're

861
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,599
probably going to be thrown off like if

862
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,559
it takes a long time to initiate flower

863
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,920
for a normal female flowering it's

864
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,199
probably going to take longer during the

865
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,000
reversal too you know and you may be

866
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,639
doing extra weeks of sprays that you

867
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,880
don't do with an eight or nine week

868
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,319
common cut you know um I'll toss in one

869
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,920
more and this is the thing that I

870
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,760
probably get asked even by Pros like

871
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,280
that have been reversing some seeds some

872
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,920
femin seeds is is the most important

873
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,680
thing is patience because like like on

874
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,800
my bottle it says wait

875
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:32,279
20 4 days 20 24 days till you see any

876
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,039
sort of reversal going on and usually by

877
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,599
24th day you're like the [ __ ] it's not

878
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,838
going to happen and that's usually about

879
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,800
the time it starts to happen when you

880
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,239
start freaking out it's usually 24 days

881
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,880
before you see any initiation any of the

882
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,679
the common clone types out there that

883
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,960
aren't hemp um before you even see balls

884
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,519
and then from there out it's usually

885
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,400
like two and a half weeks two weeks till

886
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:56,480
it drops and matures if it's going to

887
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,760
yeah number one thing it I want to say

888
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,800
it took about four to five weeks to see

889
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,000
any sacks like wanting to open yeah um

890
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,880
makes sense yeah right on yeah and then

891
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,239
like L was saying two numbers is Big you

892
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,440
want multiple small plants I'd say at

893
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,519
least two if you're doing one variety um

894
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,440
and then usually I'll do a second backup

895
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,119
variety that I usually have some more

896
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,318
confidence in or have like reversed

897
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,559
before and kind of know it's whole

898
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:26,039
shtick and deal and so um yeah like you

899
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,078
having a backup plan for if that

900
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,000
reversal fails is pretty key because

901
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,318
otherwise you're like flowering stuff

902
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,599
you don't want flower from necessarily

903
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:36,800
youve been feeding it differently like

904
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,079
you're just kind of off at that point

905
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,960
you're like well I'm either going to

906
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,519
kill all these plants and start over but

907
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,639
if you had that backup plan then you're

908
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,000
like well I'm still happy with this you

909
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,440
know what I mean I'm happy that I made

910
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,159
this and I didn't waste my time in

911
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,079
electrical and space and all that um I

912
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,639
think also another thing too is like

913
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,160
when you're flowering males you know you

914
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,559
kind of see a lot of the flowers open

915
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:05,960
you know at one time I I feel like in

916
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:10,358
reversals it's very like you know

917
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:13,000
sporadic like a fuel open here there um

918
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:14,719
but granted that's you know only with

919
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,280
the the one plant I revers which was

920
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,239
sweet PE so yeah you know what what the

921
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,720
[ __ ] do I know yeah no it it tends to be

922
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,199
correct you don't see a lot of things

923
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:28,639
open all that sweet pee looked real good

924
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:31,759
though man that was a good reversal

925
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,318
hey maybe the next one man yeah yeah hey

926
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,119
but sometimes you get it to perfectly

927
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,239
reverse but the pollen's just like not

928
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,160
viable enough for whatever reason like

929
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:41,639
sometimes pollen drop doesn't mean [ __ ]

930
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:45,838
yeah exactly or like if you're trying to

931
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:48,159
do an S1 then especially not you know

932
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,078
like when I did that AJ sour reversal

933
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,399
like it barely made any seeds on itself

934
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,200
it made like 20 but on everything else

935
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,880
it was perfectly fine you know what also

936
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,239
is common is like getting the plant to

937
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,680
then take the pollen right so you see

938
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,479
all the pistols die off all that stuff

939
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:06,480
or whatever you call them uh stigma die

940
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,199
off and yeah then you see seeds forming

941
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,400
and then they won't mature because of

942
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,159
either plant health or whatever else uh

943
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,760
I saw that even this last time with the

944
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,399
the blueberry and cross some one of the

945
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,079
plants is in lower health so the seeds

946
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,800
started forming but they just ended up

947
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,839
in a lot of immature seeds so there is

948
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,720
that too like it's not always guaranteed

949
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:28,440
even if you see it have you guys [ __ ]

950
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:32,118
around with the uh BR them back under

951
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,960
veg light after like oh yeah set yeah it

952
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,200
worked pretty well for me I actually

953
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,960
very healthy seeds yeah I didn't I was

954
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:40,159
told like to expect a higher proportion

955
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,519
of like malformed and white seed but

956
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,318
like they all came out pretty good it

957
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,400
was a lighter color maybe it wasn't like

958
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:47,119
dark sometimes it could be gray modeled

959
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,880
but I dude I've gotten some amazing

960
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,160
seeds doing that like I did one round of

961
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,720
um I don't the the fake Irene the first

962
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,519
time the Bonnet and then the second time

963
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,480
I did that I did it with the re and made

964
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,318
seeds with the same bonnet mail and it

965
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,440
made some of the most like healthy

966
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:05,000
robust brown tiger stripe seeds I've

967
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,720
ever seen and being able to hold them

968
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,599
side by side and look at them was pretty

969
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,358
wild well just freeing up flower space

970
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,720
you know what I mean like not spending

971
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,880
all that time and having that dedicated

972
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:19,118
space for you know eight to 12 weeks

973
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,838
yeah it's just

974
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,318
huge there is a follow-up question from

975
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:28,480
scrwen which

976
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:31,639
is um I imine for both of you um any

977
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,519
common threads that you see with plants

978
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,519
that are difficult to

979
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,000
reverse I would say not always no CU

980
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,800
like like Girl Scout cookies reverse is

981
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
just fine and it's one of the most dense

982
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,280
plants there is in my opinion um not not

983
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,199
now anymore I mean guess there hybrids

984
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,599
of it but the at the time the the girl

985
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,199
SC cookies was super dense and I

986
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,920
remember thinking when I went into that

987
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,199
that some of the more dense plants or

988
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,559
some of the ones always had the hardest

989
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,000
time with because the flower clusters

990
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,119
and how the floral cluster set up for

991
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,519
reversals they would stack in so tight

992
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,800
they wouldn't mature that one reverses

993
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,559
really well um same with Bubba Kush it

994
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,519
reverses really well and has very very

995
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:15,159
dense flower stacking um I have found

996
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,280
that a lot of the more loose Airy types

997
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,838
like uh older what you would call tra

998
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,839
sativa dominant strains um they tend to

999
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,759
reverse really well but again not always

1000
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,480
there's not um there's no hard set fast

1001
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,720
rules yet well I've what I've I've

1002
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,679
noticed with all the ones that I've

1003
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,959
tried and failed to reverse multiple

1004
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,639
times is they kind of fall into

1005
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,960
different categories depending on like

1006
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:39,199
what branch of the general family tree

1007
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,440
they lie on like the AJ the sour stuff I

1008
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,919
feel like it's just self-incompatible at

1009
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,920
some genetic level you know so that's

1010
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,079
one type versus like the Skittles just

1011
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,280
doesn't make pollen sacks and doesn't

1012
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,200
drop pollen you know and the pollen

1013
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,800
super lowly like super low not very

1014
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,598
viable like when you do and so it just

1015
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,440
um I feel like there's different reasons

1016
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,119
why things don't work out in reversals

1017
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,440
and um for like the really hard to

1018
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,599
reverse plants and like they I think

1019
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,280
it's just different genetic like walls

1020
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,640
that you hit and so and those will

1021
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,400
probably lie similar with the families

1022
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:20,719
of the plants they're in you know

1023
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,480
yeah yeah

1024
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,480
nice um anything else on

1025
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:33,199
reversals yeah yeah numb I guess here's

1026
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,519
another one that maybe some PE it might

1027
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,759
be not common sense to some people but

1028
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,480
like there's no need to spray the leaves

1029
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:45,560
when you're doing reversal you know

1030
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,599
um boy armpits yeah right them arm pants

1031
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:49,599
yeah that's that's just like one thing I

1032
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,760
you know again just being like a newer

1033
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,800
person that that's what ha yeah when I

1034
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,599
was young spray them arm pits yeah well

1035
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,800
cuz the leaves they just end up getting

1036
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:01,920
super damaged after a few sprays anyway

1037
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,920
even if you a lightly dosed spray and so

1038
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,200
uh like with the spray that I'm playing

1039
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,039
with like after the third spray like

1040
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,199
there's usually a decent amount of

1041
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,119
damage that you'll see on the plant yeah

1042
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,159
and that's like the higher concentration

1043
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:18,079
and then the different additives and so

1044
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,639
um you know it's just something to keep

1045
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,160
in mind that it's like the more of the

1046
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:22,639
plant you spray the more damage you're

1047
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:24,279
causing to it which is going to have a

1048
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,118
stress response that may not work in

1049
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,359
your favor

1050
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,079
exactly

1051
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:34,239
nice okay and screw's last question was

1052
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,400
more General um what plants are you guys

1053
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,358
excited most excited about currently and

1054
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,829
I guess cream pie inter whatever sh

1055
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,000
cream pie because you get to call it

1056
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:48,078
[Laughter]

1057
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,358
[ __ ] good name I'm keeping that name

1058
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,000
um I'll say interpret that whatever way

1059
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:53,960
you want whether it's like a plant that

1060
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,679
you're actually growing or something

1061
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,838
that you're interested in working with

1062
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,279
yeah any of any of those things

1063
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:03,759
yeah I'm excited to get into some uh

1064
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,040
Electric Boogaloo crosses that's

1065
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,400
definitely first up on the the list I've

1066
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:12,400
got some blueberry the blue bonnet f2s

1067
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,280
those are going in on the next one

1068
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,760
too um and then what

1069
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,960
else I've got some more stuff from high

1070
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,520
and Lanson that I need to check out but

1071
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,519
I definitely want to get in on the mango

1072
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:26,960
Haze stuff like I I have to I've never

1073
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,400
flowered any like real types of haze

1074
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,838
like like that I also need to hit up

1075
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,559
Pico for some of the the night cap

1076
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,838
wasn't it yeah I think that was his the

1077
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:38,359
sandal Woody one I really want to try

1078
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,000
that out too and so um that's like my

1079
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:41,639
next venture is like getting into real

1080
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,519
long flowering stuff that isn't just

1081
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:48,279
like sour or chem mango Haze is really

1082
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:50,400
good dude I that 2009 was my first grow

1083
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,200
mango Haze and it was one of my first

1084
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,760
real experiences with hay uh after that

1085
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,118
I had the piff stuff but they were very

1086
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,760
similar there there were Sim

1087
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,599
similarities between both

1088
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,800
I thought it was pretty oh and I'm

1089
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:07,519
tossing that Jesus OG in again for

1090
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,359
flour yeah I get my get my teal on again

1091
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,880
it was good dude it was amazing extracts

1092
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,519
I thought I thought it was good the

1093
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,480
flower is not quite as nuanced like um

1094
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:18,679
but the extracts are [ __ ] amazing so

1095
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,159
I want to see if it'll dry sift too

1096
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,118
because I feel like that would be really

1097
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,759
amazing but I think it'll be a cool

1098
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,760
breeding tool I'm kind of interested in

1099
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,359
like a blueberry terpinolene combo I

1100
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,359
think that would be really

1101
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:32,880
interesting

1102
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:34,639
yeah

1103
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,800
local

1104
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,318
um let's see uh what are you allowed to

1105
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,880
talk

1106
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:45,639
about I'm pretty [ __ ] excited for

1107
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,800
like the dog [ __ ] like the act or the

1108
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:51,519
electric boo whatever

1109
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,760
um it's it's a probably one of my

1110
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,280
favorite plants um you mean the Clone

1111
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,440
itself right yeah like the Clone itself

1112
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:03,839
um I got to smoke it once uh at the last

1113
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:08,200
party we had uh Bittersweet SD grew it

1114
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:11,639
uh super tasty Weed really great high

1115
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:15,558
and uh you know the Eppy is always from

1116
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:20,118
H&amp;L I'm always excited on that [ __ ] yeah

1117
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:23,960
um sweet PE as always um I'm actually

1118
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:26,680
growing out the uh p91 S1 for the first

1119
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,679
time and that's really [ __ ] exciting

1120
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:32,838
um I'm stoked on that for you yeah

1121
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:35,679
because it's like you know I've seen in

1122
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:38,318
the double digits of like sweet pea you

1123
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:44,318
know so it's it's pretty [ __ ] cool to

1124
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:46,599
see like the parental gen yeah um and

1125
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:50,079
the cut that I have doesn't smell

1126
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:53,000
exactly like the one that um bitter used

1127
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,160
um yeah but there was a cut that I

1128
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,800
really like that smelled exactly like

1129
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:02,960
that um his is definitely more like true

1130

00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:52,199
are there any

1212
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,119
other any excited any plants that you're

1213
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:56,399
excited so I'm going to be remaking

1214
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:59,559
bubbleberry this year here and and but

1215
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,680
I'm have to do better planning um

1216
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:03,960
obviously like the bug factor is insane

1217
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,118
Outdoors like [ __ ] insane it's an a

1218
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,240
valley so like we have white flies rips

1219
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,119
up the wazu like it's just so you guys

1220
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,439
have the green aphids down there too

1221
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,680
yeah we have we have everything you

1222
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,000
could imagine it's an ad crop problem

1223
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:19,519
and the farmers all spray around here so

1224
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,880
it gets kicked in every direction you

1225
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,318
know um it's not their Direction so I I

1226
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,119
don't know if I'll be doing outdoor this

1227
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,960
year or move it back indoor finally I

1228
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:29,920
just have so much stuff to move but I

1229
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:34,039
need to make more bubbleberry because

1230
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,079
it's finally gone almost gone um I don't

1231
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:38,960
know like I it's hard to to keep like

1232
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,480
being excited about working blueberry

1233
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,159
because I know everybody's so sick of it

1234
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,639
but I I haven't found the end of what I

1235
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:47,519
love like every time I I like the

1236
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:49,480
blueberry in Cross is exactly what I

1237
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,679
wanted from the project that's a

1238
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,000
completed completed thing I feel like um

1239
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,759
but like there some of the hybrids are

1240
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,960
really red so I like want to go there

1241
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,240
there but it's like I keep breeding for

1242
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,838
blue and all the Hybrids you know so I

1243
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:06,879
don't know I it's it's hard to keep

1244
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:09,119
doing that and keep a viable company

1245
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,680
going as I've learned

1246
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,119
but you know it's it's what I'm excited

1247
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:14,358
about still I haven't I haven't moved

1248
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,480
off from the blue breeding just because

1249
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:18,239
I understand it so well and I guess the

1250
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,880
longer I work with it the better I

1251
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,598
understand it the more predictable the

1252
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,400
breeding becomes and the less I want to

1253
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,599
move away because I can predictably

1254
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,318
breed that was the whole goal of

1255
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,920
everything from the beginning I'll just

1256
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,920
say I don't think there's any shortage

1257
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,720
of excitement for blue stuff at least

1258
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,599
not in like these circles People Are

1259
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,798
People St to hear about it dude it's

1260
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,680
been absent other than what blueberry

1261
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:41,599
muffins has been the only blueberry in

1262
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:43,519
the market that's been popular yeah yeah

1263
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,000
and like I don't really like it like the

1264
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:49,159
muffin TPS are like not like it's it's

1265
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,920
cool it's nice for the first time but

1266
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:52,399
like it's not the blueberry that I miss

1267
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,318
and like that I used to get as a

1268
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,960
teenager yeah yeah it's uh yeah I prefer

1269
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,079
like the blueberry jam stuff that the

1270
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,000
Bonnet throws yeah that's where I'm at

1271
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,079
with it it's I don't know like there

1272
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,400
there was a few years there where there

1273
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,480
was a lot of downtime and nobody was

1274
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,559
like crawling up my ass for blueberry

1275
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,000
like a blueberry I've had that before

1276
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,599
blah blah blah and it's like no not this

1277
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,519
one but like how many times have people

1278
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,079
heard that in cannabis not this one it's

1279
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,960
just not you know so it's taken years

1280
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,359
and years of enough people trying it for

1281
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,760
it to build its

1282
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,798
own now we're there and now stuff's

1283
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,000
selling out you know so it's like I got

1284
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:27,519
to go back and remake it but the time by

1285
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,039
the point it's remade are people still

1286
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,960
going to be interested that's always how

1287
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,838
this game goes I think endo's right

1288

every time I've ever been with a group

1316
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
among people like they're like trying to

1317
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,079
get me to grow blue cookies or they like

1318

actually seen some really nice ones and

1321
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,838
like I remember some kid gave me like

1322
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:59,239
eight bag seeds of a blue cookie that

1323
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,960
was really good that I got to see the

1324
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:02,439
weed of and it came in like a little

1325
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,679
Marboro

1326
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,039
cellophane yeah yeah but they didn't pop

1327
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,239
and so I was pissed because that was

1328
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,599
really good weed yeah it's strong it's

1329
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:12,719
just it's just not blueberry like I

1330
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:15,480
would have wanted like that's an ogkb

1331
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:18,358
blueberry Blue Bonnet or blueberry ex

1332
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,760
would be really nice the the OG KB we

1333
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,000
did that one and then we actually I

1334
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:26,520
think I have some we did a back cross to

1335
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,599
ogkb with ogkb cross to Dan has some Dan

1336
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,559
definitely have some yeah whatever you

1337
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,640
whatever you made yeah I think you sent

1338
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,920
me

1339
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,920
some but oh yeah screw Stone's just

1340
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,318
saying um yeah

1341
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,000
sure there you go scu's growing some oh

1342
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:44,719
okay they're gorgeous and like I said

1343
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,159
the ogkb bx1 was awesome but it was so

1344
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,759
blue dominant still which was when I

1345
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,440
really that was early on so I was still

1346
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,799
really learning like how dominant Blue

1347
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,639
Bonnet bread at that point um so it's

1348
00:54:53,798 --> 00:54:59,639
not a true what I would call A bx1 like

1349
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,440
there's no good perfect ogkb

1350
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:04,159
representation sanss blue in it there's

1351
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,720
a lot of bar in that one but it does

1352
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,960
exist it's

1353
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,358
nice

1354
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,199
nice um

1355
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:18,039
okay what's next uh from Pascal's Law

1356
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,919
okay yeah that's right this is like

1357
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:23,400
a very philosophical political question

1358
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,079
what are your biggest hopes for the

1359
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,318
future of cannabis and what are your

1360
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,318
worst fears

1361
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,559
I think we've realized some of my worst

1362
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:35,159
fears already and yeah I don't think

1363
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:38,920
it's really going to get better anytime

1364
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:40,759
soon but um I'll be basic let me start

1365
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,480
this off I want to be real basic here

1366
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,599
and just say uh it would be nice to have

1367
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,280
full

1368
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:50,079
decriminalization uh obviously like no

1369
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,039
regulation

1370
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,760
um don't you know that's what drives

1371
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:54,760
prices up

1372
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:58,479
bro

1373
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,720
well I mean to me that's an obvious

1374
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,400
answer so yeah like true

1375
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,279
decriminalization because there's been a

1376
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,798
lot of studies that have shown that like

1377
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:10,000
in certain minority youth categories

1378
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:12,559
that uh arrest are up under legalization

1379
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,719
in places like LA and yeah um they're

1380
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,519
still getting like every day in the news

1381
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:19,159
here people are getting popped where I'm

1382
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:21,838
from yeah and so like it's not really

1383
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:23,558
true you know and so I think a lot of

1384
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,119
people are like yeah it sucks now but at

1385
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:27,440
least nobody's going to prison for this

1386
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,960
[ __ ] I'm like well you do if you are

1387
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,280
like the wrong color skin and you have

1388
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,798
more than an ounce right you know and so

1389
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,240
like it's a do you guys know about

1390
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,960
Germany's uh news I know that they are

1391
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:42,879
doing something I can't remember if it's

1392
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,318
like a full someone doing right they

1393
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,720
have some weird wreck setup that they're

1394
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,719
doing I think I think it's actually

1395
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,679
pretty good but again yeah someone maybe

1396
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,879
someone in the chat knows uh oh I just

1397
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:54,759
have no trust anymore that's just my own

1398
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,400
yeah that's where I'm at like any kind

1399
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,280
of any kind of country attached the

1400
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,440
United States in any any type S of way

1401
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,039
is going to go our our route with the

1402
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,720
legalization I like whether it's

1403
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,880
Australia whether you know what I mean

1404
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:10,879
like any place remotely attached to the

1405
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,599
UN even probably will have have issues

1406
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,960
like we did where it's just

1407
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,599
corporatocracy um my hes for

1408
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,519
future okay so fish F said it's legal

1409
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,200
now yes we know it's quote unquote legal

1410
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:24,759
we're just trying to figure out like

1411
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:27,480
what that actually means um he says four

1412
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,640
plants each so there's still rtion um

1413
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,400
yeah see that's not legal to me that's

1414
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,759
it's not legal

1415
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,200
regulated for me to hold clones like I

1416
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,319
can't I remember it's it's four plants

1417
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:38,838
and I remember that the person was

1418
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:40,679
talking about it was said four plants of

1419
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:42,798
which you can only yield x amount and it

1420
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:45,159
was such a low amount that it it didn't

1421
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,960
make sense for even four plants to only

1422
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:50,798
yield a certain amount if I remember

1423
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,960
correctly like like four ounces over the

1424
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,679
total of four plants something okay so

1425
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,280
yeah fish farm no so what we're talking

1426
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,838
about is having no restrictions like

1427
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,519
like treated like a tomato plant yeah

1428
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:05,558
like legal legal not not legal yeah at

1429
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:07,079
the same time I don't know I don't want

1430
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:09,039
to rain on Germany's parade like it's

1431
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,960
still something I guess but like even in

1432
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:13,079
a regulated system you could have

1433
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,400
something that's like a farmers market

1434
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:17,880
that kind of replicates our popup shows

1435
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,240
and like has a structure behind it and

1436
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,838
Licensing and fees that go to the state

1437
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:24,759
and taxes collected they just know that

1438
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:26,159
it would usurp their system because they

1439
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,359
can't provide that level of quality

1440
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,519
quity you know what I mean like right

1441
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:32,960
now if you go and meet up with a bunch

1442
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:35,000
of these guys running big companies they

1443
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,358
I think that they are so delusional that

1444
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,039
they've convinced themselves that this

1445
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,719
shit's not mids you know they see what's

1446
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,160
on the landscape and they see all these

1447
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,159

1462
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:19,639

1465
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,078
about the [ __ ] that I like go happens

1466
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,880
legally every day in the state yeah

1467
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,720
right you know what I mean that you guys

1468
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,480
willfully Overlook because you're

1469
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,719
getting paid you know what I mean the

1470
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,358
department of cannabis control

1471
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,000
everything that California has going on

1472
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:37,960
it's an absolute joke and that's what

1473
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
the rest of the company country is

1474
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,639
emulating and so and imitating and so

1475
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,719
it's just like to me it's just a and

1476
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:47,358
until I can show up with my [ __ ]

1477
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:49,759
pickup truck with a couple pounds of

1478
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:52,159
weed with their [ __ ] State stamp on

1479
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,880
it and [ __ ] and I can pitch it to you

1480
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,399
manto man you know what I mean man to

1481
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,798
woman whatever in [ __ ] airm farmers's

1482
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,240
market then like I can actually sell you

1483
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,440
that weed and convince you that's it's

1484
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,159
like this is why it costs more and this

1485
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,358
is why it's better but they've

1486
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,598
completely taken that out of the way you

1487
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:10,279
know what I mean that's not even

1488
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:13,119
possible and so to me that's like

1489
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:15,359
willful deception to the larger market

1490
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,318
that doesn't know better in part by the

1491
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:19,598
state and lobbyists that do know better

1492
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:22,440
that represent these companies you know

1493
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,318
and so it's just big business Corporate

1494
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,880
America and a nutshell and so I don't

1495
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:29,279
really have much optimism but we can

1496
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,760
still do our own thing you know what I

1497
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,160
mean yeah like small collectives of

1498
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,880
people that are just friends that grow

1499
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:37,000
weed together like exactly like the

1500
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,160
Discord Community is like that's what we

1501
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,039
need more of because then you don't have

1502
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:43,118
to go and buy weed from the [ __ ] shop

1503
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,720
and get charged through the ass on taxes

1504
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,760
and like get kind of shitty weed a very

1505
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,480
limited scope it's almost like a union

1506
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,119
in a sorts or Collective you know no

1507
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,519
it's like this is our [ __ ] rights and

1508
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,400
everything I mean that's that's what it

1509
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,798
is about people getting together and not

1510
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,400
being [ __ ] completely greedy bastards

1511
01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:02,159
you know that's that's the hardest part

1512
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,039
with humans because it's like when when

1513
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,639
when bad humans see good things

1514
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,559
happening with between a group of people

1515
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:09,639
where everything is all equal it looks

1516
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:11,079
like something they can pre on and that

1517
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:12,318
they're like always the first to wreck

1518
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,160
it and that's the hardest part is just

1519
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:17,519
knowing how to you know slit the throats

1520
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:20,558
and you SL well you I've met a lot of

1521
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:22,038
these rich dudes and like they tie I

1522
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,519
don't even know if morality is a

1523
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:25,039
question in what they do it's like the

1524
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,519
moral thing to do is whichever thing

1525
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,799
makes the most money for them yeah you

1526
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:31,038
know what I mean that's almost what it

1527
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:33,838
seems like to me but

1528
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:37,680
um godam

1529
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:40,838
it but like seriously like it's uh

1530
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:43,038
anytime you get people that's that are

1531
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:44,558
basically middlemen Financial middlemen

1532
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,039
trying to squeeze dollars out of

1533
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,960
something else that someone else is

1534
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,319
producing and and like because you know

1535
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,960
what I mean like we go out there the

1536
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:53,079
idea is that like you go and you work

1537
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,000
you make production you get paid for

1538
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:56,400
said production but there's so many

1539
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,440
people in our econom

1540
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,079
that are just ringing a few pennies out

1541
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,960
of every little thing that someone else

1542
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,798
is doing and if you get enough of that

1543
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,278
you can make a [ __ ] ton of money and

1544
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:07,318
that's when you start making shitty

1545
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:08,760
decisions where it's like I talk about

1546
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:10,358
this all the time my wife hates [ __ ]

1547
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,720
hearing about it but I'm always talking

1548
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:16,278
about how like a business nowadays like

1549
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:18,919
a corporation's um obligation is to the

1550
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:20,760
shareholders not to the um actual

1551
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,559
customer anymore and that's why we keep

1552
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,079
getting things where it's like well why

1553
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,359
is the quality of like every experience

1554
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,240
in retail

1555
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:29,759
and fast food and everything else going

1556
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:31,719
down and it's like because someone else

1557
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,000
is ringing dollars out of it and someone

1558
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:36,278
else is having to make up that Gap by

1559
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,199
like over hour like giving people too

1560
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:40,000
many hours like it all ties together you

1561
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:41,558
know what I mean it's our economic model

1562
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
that's broken hold on I gotta show this

1563
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:46,839
one I remember this guy came in last

1564

01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:53,480

1566
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,838
he is yeah but yeah you never

1567
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,880
know if anything Denali is my [ __ ]

1568
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:00,639
[ __ ] dad so he was in the right place

1569
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,079
at the right time to have made that

1570
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:08,440

1572
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,679
good dad he's a good daddy local uh

1573
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:14,960
what's your philosophy local what's your

1574
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:18,838
take on the political situation right

1575
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:23,079
now um I don't know dude I'm like the

1576
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:25,599
last person to ask about politics

1577
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:27,599
um but I don't know I just don't want to

1578
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,359
get in trouble for growing plants you

1579
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:34,318
know that's that's really it you know

1580
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:35,960
yeah um on the less political side no

1581
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:40,599
[ __ ] the

1582
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:44,079
man say it with me now um [ __ ] the man

1583
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:46,760
um but on the less political side I

1584
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,318
think uh like for me it's kind of seeing

1585
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,680
where like the culture is going to go

1586
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:53,759
because like I don't know I believe that

1587
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:56,358
a lot of people my age are just like

1588
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,559
lost causes dude yeah

1589
01:03:56,358 --> 01:04:01,798
um so yeah just kind of curious to see

1590
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:07,200
where it's gonna

1591
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:09,440
go yeah no [ __ ] the man yeah I agree

1592
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,278
yeah I don't know I just it's hard to

1593
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,679
find anything optimistic to say about it

1594
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:15,760
you know this point we haven't seen

1595
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:19,078
really any upswings in anything positive

1596
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,920
in my opinion for cannabis uh the events

1597
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:23,400
that we used to have were amaz not would

1598
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,920
even say amazing they were cool like old

1599
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,358
Emerald cup and stuff like that where

1600
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,599
it's at Now versus

1601
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:31,400
even five years ago it's a hot [ __ ] mess

1602
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,480
um no disrespect to the emerald cup

1603
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,960
people it's just the it's a lot of

1604
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,679
people can't participate anymore that

1605
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,119
were the driving force behind it and

1606
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:42,639
that's why it's lost

1607
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:45,119
popularity um [ __ ] I mean laws period

1608
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:47,078
price of cannabis um us being able to

1609
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,838
support our family doing what we've

1610
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:53,278
always done like all of it's changed

1611
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:54,679
none for the better quality so I it's

1612
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:57,400
what positive is there to say more

1613
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:59,199
people smoking but who gives a [ __ ] like

1614
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,000
quality over quantity you know what I

1615
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,919
mean like quality people over quantity

1616
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,278
of people is a real thing um I don't

1617
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,318
know and and it's lost the sense of

1618
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:09,400
community in many ways in that respect I

1619
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,239
mean not everybody listens to the

1620
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,119
Grateful Dead granted you know but uh

1621
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,679
there was some sort of community there

1622
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:19,519
and I I feel like that's just all over

1623
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:22,038
the place I do have to say that more and

1624
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,759
more random people that just casually

1625
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:26,640
smoke weed have been hitting me up for

1626
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,720
seeds and clones and stuff and I've been

1627
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,318
going out of my way to like literally

1628
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,519

1629
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,318

couple different thing like 10 seeds of

1634
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,519

1635
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,799
like that and just like try and Spark

1636
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:45,719

1637
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:47,309
can just do this for yourself he's gonna

1638
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:49,959
get hit so hard now after this

1639
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:53,599
[Laughter]

1640
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,400
show IRL I need some seeds I need come

1641

1642
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,278
then we'll talk but I've been I don't

1643
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:01,000
know whenever I have like less like I'm

1644
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:02,599
always like trying to do too many things

1645
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,719
at once but like I would love to have

1646
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:06,920
like a thing where once a month we all

1647
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,759
met up at some dude's ranch or some [ __ ]

1648
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:11,039
and just got high and [ __ ] drank a

1649
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,160
few beers and talked about weed and [ __ ]

1650
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,760
I would love to have that in my

1651
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,440
community I just don't have the time in

1652
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,200
my life to like structure it I'm like

1653
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,000
trying to like be self-employed and like

1654
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:24,159
[ __ ] do all a million different

1655
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,559
things at once you know and so um you

1656
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,078
know but anyway like maybe at one point

1657
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,640
you know more people need to do that

1658
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,200
kind of stuff because it's cool man it's

1659
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:33,558
nice to like actually hang out with

1660
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,679
people that like have like interest

1661
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:38,400
because weed and being a weed nerd is

1662
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:40,399
kind of like it's a bubble in a bubble

1663
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,440
you know what I mean ning and ning and N

1664
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,880
it's like a a burrito full of burritos

1665
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,480
bro yeah like people don't get it when

1666
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,960
they're like oh so you really like weed

1667
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,480
and I'm just like yeah let's not talk

1668
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,760
about it it's the waters are too deep

1669
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,760
for a casual first

1670
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,319
conversation I mean I think I'll would

1671
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:00,559
just Echo what lots of people have said

1672
01:06:57,318 --> 01:07:02,318
My Hope Is that it's just currently a

1673
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,680
very immature it's at a very immature

1674
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:07,480
stage and like the you know like beer it

1675
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:09,000
will get you know to a better place

1676
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,278
that's probably as optimistic a spin as

1677
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,039
I can put on it right now yeah the weed

1678
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:17,838
swap meat [ __ ] yeah I'm

1679
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:19,880
there that H right so one of the things

1680
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:21,838
that um Pascal's Law I always thought it

1681
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,000
was Pascal's laa I don't know why but

1682
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:26,038
Pascal's Law makes makes I think it's I

1683
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,920
think it's a play on both yeah okay okay

1684
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,760
okay well one of the things that I

1685
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,838
noticed he asked in this other one was

1686
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:36,000
it says or future viral threats and that

1687
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:37,119
wasn't even a part of the the process in

1688
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,719
my brain right now as we were talking

1689
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,039
about the future of cannabis but yeah

1690
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:44,078
that's a major [ __ ] issue right local

1691
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:48,880
like this is a real thing H yeah it's a

1692
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:50,880
real thing um passing AIDS it's yeah

1693
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,079
it's like the SCD

1694
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,559
of of the weed World um yeah hlv really

1695
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:00,318
does show up places people don't

1696
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:02,278
understand phone trading it's abundant

1697
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:05,880
it's I mean it's yeah it's it's one of

1698
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:07,960
the costs you pay um sometimes [ __ ]

1699
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,480
doesn't even look sick dude like you

1700
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:13,079
wouldn't even know it exactly yeah and

1701
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,640
then other things you're like yeah

1702
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:19,679
that's 1,00% sick like I can visually

1703
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,000
identify something's wrong but I don't

1704
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:26,480
know it's just

1705
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,960
like you know you gotta like understand

1706
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:32,599
how it transmits um so like you know

1707
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,719
exchanging a runoff you know like you

1708
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:38,079
don't you want to have everybody on like

1709
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:42,000
a riser or something um or on their each

1710
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:43,519
individual um saucer so that the the

1711
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,119
runoff doesn't touch the bottom of

1712
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,839
another plant because that's how it'll

1713
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:52,278
contract it um you don't want them to

1714
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:56,238
exchange fluids uh you know xylem flum

1715
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:59,880
yeah that that too um

1716
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:02,198
but yeah it's just like I mean yeah

1717
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:05,319
every every little step kind of counts

1718
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:07,399
like if you know say you you forgot to

1719
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:09,440
bleach a pair of scissors and you didn't

1720
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:12,039
realize it you know

1721
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,599
like you may have infected something you

1722
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:16,439
may have not and I think the most

1723
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,600
important thing to nail home is that

1724
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:21,278
some plants like we're noticing like

1725
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,560
they may not look sick at all so

1726
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,960
visually it's not something you can

1727
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,000
necessarily detect visually a lot of

1728
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,439
them can carry it and don't necessarily

1729
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,838
show any of the disease but if you have

1730
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:31,318
those in your garden they can infect

1731
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:34,960
other plants that really show the

1732
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,798
disease real fast so it really is about

1733
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,920
either being super clean only popping

1734
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,920
from seed not taking in Clone ones and

1735
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,960
playing that game or constantly being

1736
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:46,640
able to have access to test and

1737
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,679
test no shared root zones between

1738
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,880
varieties either yeah that's a huge one

1739
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,719
it's like even [ __ ] cloning trays and

1740
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:58,119
[ __ ] like I don't know dude like once

1741
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:01,279
you run into to a scare it's just

1742
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:04,840
like exactly exactly every last thing

1743
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:08,319
for over course of week um

1744
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:11,079
so yeah and I mean I I work with it you

1745
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:15,119
know so I I kind of see how it spreads

1746
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:18,640
too so it's just like once you kind of

1747
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:21,920
see it you just you would rather want to

1748
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,560
stay like on top like be precautious you

1749
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,840
know yeah rather than like oh [ __ ] you

1750
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,320
know my plants are sick maybe I should

1751
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,319
put them on their own saucers so yeah

1752
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:34,079
it's a really really good point for not

1753
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:36,119
using AOC cloners too like if you're

1754
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,559
doing collecting don't use AOC cloners

1755
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,640
oh man that's that for the disease yep

1756
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,000
you can [ __ ] your entire collection like

1757
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,199
that dude super fast I wish I still had

1758
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,399
mine I used to have a couple 128 cell

1759
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:50,079
ones and I kind I want a flower in one

1760
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:52,599
yeah go yeah dude I have one you come

1761
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,479
pick up bro it is ready to rock [ __ ]

1762
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,480
yeah

1763
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:58,079
dude oh we still got to go to that

1764
01:10:55,479 --> 01:10:59,479
underground Garden down by you I sent

1765
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:02,399
you that [ __ ] right yeah yeah yeah you

1766
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:05,639
did that [ __ ] looks crazy yeah it does

1767
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,238
yeah we got a lot to do yeah um and then

1768
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,640
I guess another thing to add uh but they

1769
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:13,919
probably covered this on the Tumi uh

1770
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:17,079
podcast is leaves and Roots can show

1771
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,640
very different results that's right yeah

1772
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:23,000
you get them tested yep yeah parts of

1773
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,760
the plant being tested but again nail at

1774
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,439
home there are carriers that don't

1775
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,840
necessarily show it so don't assume that

1776
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:31,238
you can see it like plants can stay very

1777
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:34,159
healthy looking that are less

1778
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:36,198
susceptible to the virus but still carry

1779
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:39,879
it and transfer it to other ones that

1780
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:40,799
don't don't assume any of it s I'm

1781
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,119
laughing at

1782
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,639
comments yeah yeah someone remembers

1783
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:48,960
back in the

1784
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:51,239
day back in the day in 2017 yeah we were

1785
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,719
talking about back then it's it's been

1786
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:54,319
around for a while it just took a long

1787
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,920
time for us to understand what that

1788
01:11:54,319 --> 01:12:00,639
truly means yeah yeah and um I'll also

1789
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,760
add like I've lurked on clone trading

1790
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:06,719
discords and like I can guarantee those

1791
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,679
[ __ ] Gardens aren't as clean as some

1792
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:12,760
people but dude like I see some pictures

1793
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,880
and I'm like I'd be damned you know like

1794
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,520
what the

1795
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,760
[ __ ] um you know I'm not a big ADV

1796
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,120
advocate for clone sales yeah people

1797
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,560
that don't understand what they have in

1798
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:24,399
their room and that's abundant as [ __ ] I

1799
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,120
get messages from people all day hey I

1800
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:27,759
heard this clone for sale is this a good

1801
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:29,599
price for it and I just smack my head

1802
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,600
like don't even get it yeah dude don't

1803
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,679
even get it I just can't get over how

1804
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,600
many of these people use the the phrase

1805
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,960
breeders cut that's when I know you're

1806
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,440
full as [ __ ] yeah breeders cut yeah

1807
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:42,158
you've got every breeder selected cut of

1808
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,799
every single one of these varieties

1809
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:47,198
exactly Cup winning breeders cut oh I

1810
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,440
met so and so and it's like well how can

1811
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:51,519
you prove that yeah how can you prove

1812
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:52,919
that you got direct from this person

1813
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,120
they're like well I know him and I'm

1814
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,119
just like well like okay

1815
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,600
cool okay um we have a few questions

1816
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,399
from dubie I assume that's how you say

1817
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,760
it right that it's not that's the point

1818
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,079
of his name right duie anyway um taking

1819
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:20,679
care of and feeding long flowering

1820
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:22,679
plants uh let's say 12 weeks and

1821
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:25,840
longer local you want to go I know

1822
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,199
you've had a few recently um I mean

1823
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,000
it's just the same process but stretch

1824
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:29,919
out it is yeah I mean you're kind of

1825
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,439
just

1826
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:36,520
elongating the feed you know like

1827
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:39,559
say because most schedules are designed

1828
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:43,040
for like nine week crops so it's like

1829
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:48,560
you're not going to feed a 14we plant in

1830
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:50,359
a 9we period um but yeah I mean I kind

1831
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:53,840
of just keep them fed because they go

1832
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:56,599
longer they'll get hungrier whatever

1833
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:00,600
um but yeah any

1834
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:02,639
specifics I mean don't go maybe do you

1835
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,520
want to help do the that translation so

1836
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,239
for a 9we feed what are the you know

1837
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,719
they like a few segments right how would

1838
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,519
that translate to like a 14 beginning

1839
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:12,960
flowering mid flower and flower yeah

1840
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,719
just you just elongate each set yeah if

1841
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:19,239
it's if it's a 12we plant versus a nwe

1842
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:20,880
plant each set gets like one more ESS

1843
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:23,119
well like a lot of the feed like if you

1844
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,079
follow like a Bottle recipe that's like

1845
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:26,559
you know like if you're running Cana

1846
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:29,559
they say like oh if you have longer

1847
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:32,600
flowering plants like repeat weeks like

1848
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,920
three to four as many times as you need

1849
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:38,280
to like then and then once you get to

1850
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:41,319
like you know I don't know like seven or

1851
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:42,439
SW call it final swelling like Growers

1852
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:44,719
we should all know what final swelling

1853
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:48,799
is the final swell that's when the end

1854
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:50,560
stage begin yeah experience honestly but

1855
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,880
with also with longer flowering plants

1856
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,199
like they don't necessarily like

1857
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:57,920
nitrogen is heavy other plants yeah you

1858
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:59,439
don't need to to feed as heavy with them

1859
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,000
you don't need to water as much

1860
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:02,879
necessarily with narrow Leaf dominant

1861
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,520
plants um there's little tricks like

1862
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,279
that that you'll learn over time but

1863
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:09,520
generally speaking it's just a longer

1864
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:11,639
stretched out of the same

1865
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,040
thing I do want to say though that

1866
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:15,239
reminded me I was like a little

1867
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:17,079
distracted at first that dude name was

1868
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:19,000
dubie the first guy that I saw growing

1869
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:23,960
indoor his name was dubie he passed away

1870
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,439
recently so uh rip doobie rip

1871
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:30,480

1872
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:30,479

1874

sweet well done dude well done was that

1879
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:57,319
a salmon Pig middle [ __ ]

1880
01:15:53,600 --> 01:16:00,639
yeah uh okay followup from duie

1881
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:03,079
experiences changing growing Styles uh

1882
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:06,800
during your growing career anything from

1883
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:09,399
minor tweaks to major major like style

1884
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:13,039
change I guess I've done everything and

1885
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:15,799
it all works yeah done everything it all

1886
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,880
works except for me I didn't ever get um

1887
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,679
what the [ __ ] is it called deep water

1888
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,639
culture like circul rdwc Rec I could

1889
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,719
never do it right I never nailed that I

1890
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:25,000
don't know if it's because I didn't have

1891
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:26,439
a perfect Chiller whatever it is but I

1892
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,479
never had a chiller that's probably why

1893
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:30,039
it didn't work I tried it a few times

1894
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:31,759
but I think you need a major Chiller to

1895
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:34,039
make it work but I don't know I couldn't

1896
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,360
do it I my friend was working on a farm

1897
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:38,760
in Oklahoma that had like a whole

1898
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:42,000
Greenhouse of that [ __ ] yeah and I was

1899
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,560
like that's too much yeah like that to

1900
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,840
maintain that it just looked like a

1901
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,600
nightmare yeah I was like I'd rather

1902

1926
01:17:51,319 --> 01:17:55,719
shirtless model or

1927
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,239
whatever

1928
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:59,800
you to get you in some Tom of Finland

1929
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:02,359
pics with like a mustache and like a hat

1930
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:06,440
all naked yeah

1931
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:09,198
binging yeah too good I knew it was

1932
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:12,079
coming I want to reframe that question

1933
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:13,879
um have any of you had to change Styles

1934
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:16,519
out of necessity like out of some kind

1935
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,880
of like situational speaking of speaking

1936
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,360
of renting like I started off you doing

1937
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:24,079
tables and I quickly found like when I

1938
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,960
got a 24-hour notice tables [ __ ] suck

1939
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,439
for that like yeah because all of a

1940
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,960
sudden you're having to take plants out

1941
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:32,559
of a a a system of feed that they can't

1942
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,239
be dry like that all the time because

1943
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,280
they're used constantly having a

1944
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:39,198
flooding system um I moved them all to

1945
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:42,279
single pots and that's when I realized I

1946
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,839
have to do uh hand feed drained to waste

1947
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:47,198
after that point because it just wasn't

1948
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:49,440
going to work any other way like renting

1949
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:50,719
kind of necessitated that change uh

1950
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,039
having people come into your grow and

1951
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,480
having to hide your grow necessitate

1952
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:56,840
necessitated that change so you know

1953
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:58,399
that's one thing to think of if you're

1954
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,880
renting don't necessarily jump into

1955
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,119
tables because it's a really risky

1956
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,400
situation at that point they're harder

1957
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,198
to take down and keep your keep small if

1958
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:08,039
you do get some

1959
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:10,599
2x4s right yeah they fit in the Subaru

1960
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:13,800
and in a black trash bag you know yeah

1961
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:16,120
like pots pots you can fit about 90 of

1962
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,520
the three gallon into a small U-Haul if

1963
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:20,039
you really stack it

1964
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,080
hard yeah I mean was my main thing for

1965
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:24,479
me I just bought my first house and so

1966
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:26,840
my style changed a lot once I actually

1967
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,599
like owned a house so I like my setup's

1968
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,119
different now because I like framed out

1969
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,440
a little flower room and I'm going to

1970
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:36,359
frame a little bedroom too in cloning

1971
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:38,238
space and so um now I can be a lot more

1972
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:39,559
permanent but like the mobile setup

1973
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:42,319
which I feel like a lot of people are

1974
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:45,520
stuck with for me it's like yeah 2x4s

1975
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,880
small tents uh growan because you

1976
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,920
bringing bags of soil into your

1977
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,840
apartment I don't how the [ __ ] do you do

1978
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,000
that

1979
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,400
l d I used to do it into a big apartment

1980
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,439
complex it wasn't easy it just just

1981
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:59,238
always

1982
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:01,839
Asing dude people see that [ __ ] my

1983
01:19:59,238 --> 01:20:04,119
landlord was literally so he was floor

1984
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,199
level with street level and I had to

1985
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:08,399
park right in front of his window and

1986
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:10,599
bring it downstairs right under him and

1987
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:14,158
I lived under my landlord and grew above

1988
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:17,639
him to to the left of him behind him

1989
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:18,519
across from him and Below him and I was

1990
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:21,199
different

1991
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:23,600
names yeah it was it was not fun and

1992
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,399
then disposing of all that that's what I

1993
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,000
mean is getting rid of it like the

1994
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:29,638
growan makes it easy CU you're just

1995
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,198
taking the trash out you know I mean

1996
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:34,159
that's kind of what I do you know D the

1997
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:36,238
bottles all the plastic bottles all the

1998
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:39,279
[ __ ] [ __ ] hiding all that

1999
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:42,238
[ __ ] night it was a nightmare I have so

2000
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:44,359
many like Cana DRS that I not like you

2001
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,039
like used ones you know yeah yeah yeah

2002
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:48,399
because like I'm not just gonna throw

2003
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:50,079
[ __ ] away in residential you know

2004
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,719
homeless people are going to [ __ ] go

2005
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:53,920
there Oh They'll dig it out and then

2006
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:55,840
like yeah leave it outside the can and

2007
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:59,000
right when you go use someone you don't

2008
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,679
likes can exactly I did I did a lot of

2009
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,158
that and yeah whatever look we all know

2010
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,480
you're just staying up late gaming and

2011
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,638
you're pissing in those can of

2012
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,198
[Laughter]

2013
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:11,119
jugs the whole tub is just filled with

2014
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:13,559
piss jugs of

2015
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:16,000
Cana nitrogen

2016
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,239
man nitrogen

2017
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,560
formula oh [ __ ] yeah I know I I've

2018
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:22,000
changed especially with clone when it

2019
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,239
came to cloning I've tried every single

2020
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,560
cloning technique from aroc cloner to

2021
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:30,559
you know yeah domes to God bubble

2022
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:32,440
cloners all kinds of different things um

2023
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,159
and I always end up going back to domes

2024
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:36,559
I always end up going back to does just

2025
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:38,238
because I like soil man like I tried

2026
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,679
doing the cocoa thing for the small

2027
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:42,119
scale indoor and I didn't get bad

2028
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:44,319
results but I was just kind of always

2029
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:45,800
mad at it you know what I mean and I

2030
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:47,759
felt like it was harder to dial in

2031
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,920
certain plants and then like I just went

2032
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,119
back to promix and like small amendments

2033
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,239
to it like dry amendments and like

2034
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:56,719
[ __ ] great love it and then I blended

2035
01:21:55,238 --> 01:22:00,519
all that cocoa in too so it's kind of

2036
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:04,158
like a king's mix yeah um nice yeah so I

2037
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:06,960
guess it's a hybrid of all now but um

2038
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:09,319
good [ __ ] yeah good

2039
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,319
[ __ ] this was an

2040
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:13,519
interesting I've never really thought or

2041
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:14,759
heard of something like this before have

2042
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,760
you

2043
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:20,039
guys I could see it maybe stressing it

2044
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,520
out and showing a Herm trait that may

2045
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:25,560
have already been there you know because

2046
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:29,239
gg4 is super hermy

2047
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:30,679
yeah it could be um I mean if it's a

2048
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:33,000
seed plant doesn't it still have still

2049
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,800
have some and km's kind of hurt me too

2050
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,600
you know what I mean not like the worst

2051
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,760
way

2052
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,159
possible so this could be a stress thing

2053
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,880
as well is that what you're saying sorry

2054
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:43,158
yeah it's super stressful to graft a

2055
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,920
plant like most of them die until you

2056
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:46,920
get really dialed in like when I was

2057
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:49,719
watching people do it and like got to do

2058
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,840
a few trays all of mine died on my first

2059
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:53,719
few attempts you know and then like one

2060
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,760
dude just had the touch and so like he

2061
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:57,039
was grafting all kinds of [ __ ] yeah I

2062
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,639
had a friend who could do that I I

2063
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,238
wasn't very good at grafting myself well

2064
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,840
what we noticed was the root stock is

2065
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:05,198
very important and you'll find a plant

2066
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,800
that's very a very compatible root stock

2067
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:08,960
compared to everything else and it's not

2068
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,719
always what you think it was like to me

2069
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,239
I was blown away I was like that piece

2070
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:15,279
of [ __ ] plant is like the best root

2071
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:17,079
stock we have like okay I mean I guess

2072
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,119
it actually has a use in my mind now

2073
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:20,679
because like I don't know why the [ __ ]

2074
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:22,920
we even flower it so hold on what in

2075
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:24,560
what context were you grafting to begin

2076
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,960
with like were you trying to do like

2077
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,199
Apple thing like the apple tree thing no

2078
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,760
we were trying to like see if we could

2079
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:34,359
improve Vigor on hard to grow plants

2080
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,480
with shitty root systems and like just

2081
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:39,920
low Vigor in general so it was like Z

2082
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:41,638
stuff OG stuff um and put it on a more

2083
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,880
vigorous root stock to see if it helped

2084
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:45,639
it grow better and it what it what we

2085
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,239
realized is that it kind of relieved

2086
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:50,039
viral symptoms if you had a cut that was

2087
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:51,519
just dud it out it's the only copy you

2088
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:53,439
have access to and you still wanted to

2089
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,080
use it you could get it like out of the

2090
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:57,359
full dud Zone where it'll flower

2091
01:23:55,079 --> 01:24:01,039
normally make some seeds and move on

2092
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:04,439
that way you can Trash the cut um and so

2093
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:06,880
I did that with like the the Hindu

2094
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:10,158
Skittles that's where those came from

2095
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:12,400
Hindu Z I mean doing those yeah because

2096
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,638
you know they it's a thing with like uh

2097
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:17,039
obviously like agricultural crops right

2098
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:19,520
um yeah they almost breed for root

2099
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,039
stocks I think it' be cool be for plant

2100
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,800
counts too you know someone should start

2101
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,439
a company doing that and be like hey you

2102

pretty cool yeah yeah because we had

2136
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:42,118
really high failure rates depending on

2137
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:44,719
what the root stock was so that's cool

2138
01:25:42,118 --> 01:25:48,519
that it's like not you know not going to

2139

2141
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:56,119

I'll let him know it's so what try a

2148
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:17,479
different browser too we had the same

2149
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:21,039
web person at some point and I agree it

2150
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:22,359
needs to be totally redone there's yeah

2151
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:24,880
both of our sites need to be totally

2152
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:26,359
redone but I I should do that I I'm

2153
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,199
capable of it I just have so much other

2154
01:26:26,359 --> 01:26:30,559
[ __ ] to do yeah I'll I'll let them know

2155
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:32,719
if they're not working yeah definitely

2156
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,920
try a different browser if you haven't

2157
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:38,279
yeah that can be a big issue with h kind

2158
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:40,158
of archaic old websites they can be very

2159
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:42,000
browser specific if you don't just a

2160

01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:17,519
first good weed was from bitters like

2173
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:20,960

2177
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:31,880
wreck in Humble at one time it was at

2178
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,159
hprc and it was all seated and it was

2179
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,039
really good but that was actually one of

2180
01:27:33,158 --> 01:27:37,439
the first seed runs that I like grew

2181
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,158

2182

train wack and I usually don't like

2186
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:47,880
purple urle anything but I really like

2187
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,960
train wack so I kind of leveled it out

2188
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,600
to where it was no anxiety but just

2189
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,719
really Stony that was the first time I

2190

01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:45,319
do a whole episode on this but like a

2236
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:48,198
couple of weeks ago you you were really

2237
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:50,799
wanting to rant about uh

2238
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:53,439
polyploids oh you want to give us like a

2239
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:56,279
little like uh some context for that

2240
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:59,000
well it's all the rage right now like H

2241
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:00,639
HSC just released like a [ __ ] hourong

2242
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,238
video on it like two weeks ago I

2243
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:06,480
couldn't even get through it yeah I was

2244
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:07,959
like I love hsd yeah right unfortunately

2245
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:09,519
why I'm wearing this flannel is because

2246
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,800
I have one of their old shirts on that I

2247
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,800
paint

2248
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:16,359
in and I was like I'm covering this [ __ ]

2249
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,879
up man nothing but love for them polys

2250
01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:20,439
are great talking man they're whatever

2251
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,400
they're running a business it's it's

2252
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:24,118
just a shenanigan another shenanigan to

2253
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,519
chase for people that aren't yeah well

2254
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:27,799
whole thing that people are chasing is

2255
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,280
seedless right and like I've read all

2256
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,239
these papers and like you don't get

2257
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:33,519
seedless you just don't get fully formed

2258
01:30:31,238 --> 01:30:35,879
seeds and maybe it's less but you get

2259
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,199
little white seeds you get pods man yeah

2260
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,639
on a lot of it some of those are the

2261
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:42,759
worst I doubt a lot of them's ability to

2262
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,279
truly make them and test for them

2263
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,639
because I don't know like they at least

2264
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:48,319
hired a real geneticist you know what I

2265
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,679
mean they had him talk in that video and

2266
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,679
[ __ ] I'm like I haven't looked into the

2267
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:54,719
guy at all he may be [ __ ] but like I

2268
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,158
don't [ __ ] know him so of paper on

2269
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,679
polyploids the other day that just kind

2270
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,000
of [ __ ] blew most of it out of the

2271
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:02,960
water well the only the only attribute

2272
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,238
that I can say for sure that might be

2273
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:08,118
beneficial is for Mass scale outdoor

2274
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:09,799
seedless you know what I mean so you're

2275
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:11,559
not worried about hemp farms and Herms

2276
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,679
and stuff you know what I mean but guess

2277
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,679
what like you're you're I I don't know

2278
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:18,158
like I guess like it doesn't even

2279
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,359
protect you if the crop itself Herms you

2280
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:21,319
know what I mean three sets of

2281
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:23,359
chromosomes on a triploid plant like

2282
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:24,479
they I'm they can line up with another

2283
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:27,319
triploid

2284
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:29,599
I would imagine they can yeah you know

2285
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:31,599
and like um there's also people doing

2286
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,880
tetrol work and I'm like well tetr

2287
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:37,280
you'll just make mixoploids and other

2288
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,000
polyols yeah tetrol I believe can breed

2289
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,319
with diploid because you're still gonna

2290
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:46,198
have an even amount of chromosomes but

2291
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:48,319
like yeah uh triploid can't make yeah

2292
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:51,158
PID but that doesn't mean that there's

2293
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:53,519
no seed that forms at all and so I think

2294
01:31:51,158 --> 01:31:54,960
it's dubious that claim in a nutshell I

2295
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,880
haven't really [ __ ] with it in person

2296
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,760
so I'll just leave it at that but like

2297
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,760
the other things more in the hemp Market

2298
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:03,320
that I've seen um and I won't name names

2299
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,480
they're they know who they are but

2300
01:32:03,319 --> 01:32:08,679
they're um um have all these things

2301
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:12,000
about increased Vigor and at least in

2302
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:15,039
CBD plants there was a significantly

2303
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,158
different increase in CBD production but

2304
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:21,519
that wasn't true for the THC plants they

2305
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:24,158
tested and so you get a slightly bigger

2306
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,880
plant but even when uh they were looking

2307
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:28,399
at the yields the flower yields weren't

2308
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,800
increased the biomass yields were

2309
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:31,759
everything's all about biomass for these

2310
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,840
corporate [ __ ] so that's what I mean

2311
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,360
yeah and so like if you're not

2312
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,119
increasing THC and you're not increasing

2313
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:39,279
Bud yield then like I don't really see

2314
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:41,039
what the point is because all you're

2315
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:42,800
doing is enabling people to grow more

2316
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:46,118
boof and crash the market out at a

2317
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:48,520
bigger scale because like biomass at

2318
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:50,000
least like the way I understood it like

2319
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,040
you know like when we were doing like

2320
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,600
lab studies and [ __ ] it's like the

2321
01:32:52,039 --> 01:32:57,800
entire weight of the plant like yeah

2322
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,480
that's stem Lea root yeah anything you

2323
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:02,719
pull out of the ground that gets put

2324
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:05,158
into that [ __ ] bail you know and so

2325
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,719
um to me it just seems fruitless maybe

2326
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:10,319
I'm wrong but like um nobody's actually

2327
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:12,920
doing interesting breeding in the larger

2328
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:15,118
market anyway so like why would adding a

2329
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:18,239
new technique to a bottleneck genetic

2330
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:19,359
pool like really change anything exactly

2331
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:22,319
it's just

2332
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:24,839
a it's a marketing yeah exactly it's a

2333
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:26,439
marketing buzzword yeah it's just gonna

2334
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,880
be I don't think anything's really G to

2335
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:31,919
come of it just like we haven't really

2336
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:34,039
seen anything come up mainam you know

2337
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,880
yeah ex we've read we've read the paper

2338
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:40,198
Benjamin that's that's the paper I was

2339
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:42,960
referencing biomass increase what you

2340
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:45,919
[ __ ] do you know yeah biomass is not

2341
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:47,960
important to me you know I breed for I

2342
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,480
turn it into tinctures and you know what

2343
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:52,920
I mean like hash like it's for me to

2344
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:54,319
consume and so biomass isn't really that

2345
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,520
useful to me

2346
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,989
I'd like this question before we're done

2347
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:02,520
this is a go did Eagle 20 give a certain

2348
01:33:59,989 --> 01:34:05,399
[Laughter]

2349
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,679
flavor yeah I don't I don't know uh

2350
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:09,960
maybe I'm [ __ ] dude I'll tell you

2351
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:14,520
what before I was educated I sprayed a

2352
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:16,039
lot of Spectra side yeah SPX yeah yeah a

2353
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,920
lot of that like the guy that taught me

2354
01:34:16,039 --> 01:34:20,039
how to do clones I sprayed every single

2355
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:23,920
clone tray with that [ __ ] Lear I learned

2356
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:25,920
on Fon 27 Fon 27 and Spector side m

2357
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,440
together turns black we would call that

2358
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,199
black death and then spray that oh

2359
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:32,479
you're it was it was bad and I would do

2360
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:35,359
it without a mask like I'm probably of

2361
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:37,158
cancer as speak from it yeah yeah people

2362
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:39,039
laugh at me at work because I'm like

2363
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:41,158
super serious about wearing a respirator

2364
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,158
when there's just dust in the air even

2365
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:43,519
you know what I mean I'm like I'm not

2366
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,638
breathing that [ __ ] in man you know how

2367
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:49,679
much [ __ ] aminox I breathed in like

2368
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:53,840
oh my God like even how

2369
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:56,279
much oh yeah yeah I just don't I don't I

2370
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,039
just don't use like n95s and dirt you

2371
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:59,279
know dust masks anymore because guess

2372
01:34:58,039 --> 01:35:01,039
what you pull it off at the end of the

2373
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:04,319
day of working and the whole inside of

2374
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:06,519
the Mask is covered in dir yeah have

2375
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,479
like actual I wear a respirator now a

2376
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:10,679
painters respirator yeah with a with the

2377
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:14,718
cans on the

2378
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:15,920
side when I used it when I used it I

2379
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,279
don't I didn't start using that until

2380
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,480
way later uh fun fact is the the pink

2381
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:24,279
cart it's like a pink magenta it's not

2382
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:25,718
like hot pink there's like a hot pink

2383
01:35:24,279 --> 01:35:27,559
and then there's like a m there's like

2384
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:30,079
three tiers of them yeah yeah but you

2385
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,840
want to get like that really dark pink

2386
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:35,800
for pesticide application that's rated

2387
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,920
for it I got hot pink yeah I think

2388
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:40,279
that's just like the dust and fumes one

2389
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:43,158
yeah I don't probably the cheapest

2390
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:45,279
one but yeah um there but it'll say on

2391
01:35:43,158 --> 01:35:46,960

on there I can't remember but it it

2393
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,560

2394
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:59,118
yeah okay so where we at yeah so we

2395
01:35:54,399 --> 01:36:02,559
don't really have uh any questions left

2396
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:05,839
um anything else that we wanted to talk

2397
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,840
about these

2398
01:36:06,039 --> 01:36:11,519
nuts every

2399
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,639
time um oh by the way when I was having

2400
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,520
that brainfire earlier when you're

2401
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,319
talking about the drops I meant that

2402
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,520
there might be another blue drop coming

2403
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:21,319
another blueberry you know another

2404
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,080
Bonnet drop right I don't know if oh

2405
01:36:21,319 --> 01:36:24,079

2406
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:26,960
the

2407
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,238
yeah yeah I mean I guess yeah well no I

2408
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,600
said it within we were talking about

2409
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,319
high and Lonesome stuff so it was

2410
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:35,239
probably confusing yeah the timeline on

2411
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:37,198
it I'm not sure um there is more blue

2412
01:36:35,238 --> 01:36:38,799

2413
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:40,319
stuff being made specifically blue

2414
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,400

2419
01:36:52,198 --> 01:36:57,839
we they things there there might be one

2420
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:59,759
very big and exciting thing um but I

2421
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,880
don't know if I don't think we can talk

2422
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,920
about that yet we're going to be doing

2423
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,079
more with the the can Cabana guys too

2424
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:07,039
there's a few more of the dudes we want

2425
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:09,359
to have on um some really important ones

2426
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:11,800
yeah sub Rob interview sub I'm stoked

2427

for sub Rob I love sub Rob sub Rob like

2428
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,760

2429
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,360
with him um we have his seeds on our

2430
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,520
site under seed trip um sub Rob was one

2431
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:22,279
of the dudes that helped Run San Diego's

2432
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:25,639
finest onight he's probably one of the

2433
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:27,238
most respected members him Sean k um

2434
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:30,039
there are a few others but those those

2435
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:33,158
are the ones that I'm closest with

2436
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:35,800
um it was just such an influential part

2437
01:37:33,158 --> 01:37:40,238
of the Clone only trading scene during

2438
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:42,520
the Forum eras of like 07 to

2439
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:44,759
2001 um almost everything ran through

2440
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:47,639
San Diego's finest and it was one of the

2441
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,280
I think longest running most pages so

2442
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:51,400
far so they I think they completely went

2443
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,920
over page 500 and had to go to a whole

2444
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:57,759
new SD fin

2445
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:59,440

2446
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,480

2447
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:02,799
[ __ ] cool and he he's just very very

2448
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:05,039
down toe

2449
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,400
transparent um we've always gotten along

2450
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:09,359
politically and everything so I'm stoked

2451
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:11,118
to have him on he's funny as [ __ ] but

2452

2453
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:16,839
very humble with his knowledge so stoked

2454
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:19,079
on that one um yeah the the Cana Cabana

2455
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,520

2460
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,360
some insight into our process we we're

2461
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,679
really more than like a couple of weeks

2462
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:35,799
ahead like we're not that professional

2463

yet um so it's not like we have the

2464
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:40,480

2468
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:49,560
goes yeah I mean that's for me really in

2469
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:52,679
terms of like talking points today yeah

2470
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:54,960

01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:29,198
yeah like it's just really good it was

2511
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,760
just unique too and just like different

2512
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:34,479
and the resin on it I was just like

2513
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:37,960
incredible yeah I can't wait to smoke

2514
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:39,319
some I guess other than that I guess

2515
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:41,039
this is I mean I don't know if we're get

2516
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:42,799
this is gonna be the end of season 10

2517
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:44,238
the start of season 11 I think they

2518
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,400
already did the I don't know I think I

2519
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:48,479
already like committed to it this being

2520
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:51,519
the first episode of season 11 yeah that

2521
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:53,799
makes sense season 11 episode one

2522
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:57,199
[ __ ] um oh and we the the

2523
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:59,480
Raffles sometimes in our um the Raffles

2524
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:01,039
were those are super dope yeah yeah they

2525
01:40:59,479 --> 01:41:04,839
were pretty fun the one thing I don't

2526
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,840
want to do is like make gambling

2527
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:08,799
addicts I'm always concerned with that

2528
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:10,719
because like you know like in a group

2529
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,119
based on weed there come a background of

2530
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:14,760
a lot of addictions and addictive

2531
01:41:12,118 --> 01:41:16,079
personalities so like that would be

2532
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,400
horrible to trigger something like that

2533
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:18,920
so I'm trying to be very cautious about

2534
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:20,839
it but at the same time it's a way to

2535
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,880
get we need to keep a tally of who's

2536
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:26,319
playing every week and then H like three

2537
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:28,840
weeks in a row you're out you're out for

2538
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:30,439
like two weeks time it out yeah no I

2539
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,840
just want to be I want to be careful and

2540
01:41:30,439 --> 01:41:33,399
and also say that you know that's always

2541
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,719
in our thoughts too because they were

2542
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:38,279
just super fun with the the live chat on

2543
01:41:35,719 --> 01:41:39,880
there too like co-current with them like

2544
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:41,920
I was just listening to those and like

2545
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,760
doing drywall work in my house and [ __ ]

2546
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,840
and like having a blast man it made that

2547
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,000
