00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,698
fantastic yeah so I was just telling

24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,579
everyone we're going to be going over

25
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:03,599
the Forum era post overgrow so 2006

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,060
roughly and on and uh I was explaining

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,560
how there are a lot of forums still up

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,060
that were around during that time like

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,280
the farm

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,900
um I see mag

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,420
troll it up some of the some of the

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,460
others that came around that time

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
um but there are a lot that are not up

34
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,199
and people that like to pretend that

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,159
they're around back then

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,840
often reference the ones that are still

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,580
up that they can go back and like reread

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
and pretend like hey I was I was there I

39
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,938
knew what was going on but they're

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,439
missing like 90 of the conversations

41
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,179
that were going on because those aren't

42
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,519
even accessible any longer

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,759
one of one of the things I notice about

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,158
that era uh is that

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,140
you know a lot of times we catch people

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,479
on stuff

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,079
um because people go back to [ __ ]

48
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,879
yes and they read uh you know threads

49
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,219
and things like that to pick up years

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,379
and tidbits and information that like

51
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:59,819
make their their stories sound better

52
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:02,938
yeah but they weren't there to know who

53
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,519
was who or like who to take seriously or

54
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,859
what was misinformation even then yeah

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,978
you know and so a lot of times it's a

56
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,979
tell

57
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,759
it's a big tell but to someone that

58
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,520
never read any of those forums you can

59
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,280
come out and confidently start jabbing

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,340
about a bunch of stuff yeah and sound

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,199
like you were there yeah um not I'm not

62
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,300
gonna say anybody's name but uh someone

63
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,060
made a post the other day that obviously

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,599
was not around on the forums and said

65
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,840
you know X person got cloned from y

66
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:40,979
person got cloned from Z person and it

67
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,340
was just super off like the most off it

68
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:46,619
could be I mean we I'm that's learning

69
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,598
from me I try we try not to name names

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,080
when it's not but it was pretty funny

71
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,299
the chain of custody yeah that was

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,860
asserted

73
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,840
you know you you just had you just had

74
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,760
to laugh at a certain point but yeah I

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,780
will say even back then

76
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,280
like uh you know I don't know exactly

77
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,039
know how to describe it but I would say

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,919
that like like overgrow even had some of

79
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,759
the best commentary but also some of the

80
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,158
worst

81
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,019
like you kind of the forums really

82
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,939
helped figuring out what you were doing

83
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,219
if you already went in there with some

84
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,680
connection and some ability to discern

85
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,120
yeah you know cannabis world was a

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,760
little bit more like where the adults

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,340
gathered yeah uh over a girl you could

88
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,500
have like everyone from like some 17

89
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,060
year old kid [ __ ] posting you even

90
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,598
though we didn't use that term back then

91
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,479
yeah to like Chimera and Sam Skunk Man

92
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:42,539
and phds and breeding talking [ __ ] in

93
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,459
another in another area of it yeah so it

94
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:45,419
really was like a cross-section of weed

95
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,539
in America

96
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,098
my main my main thing would be like I

97
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:53,699
would compare that to like grass City

98
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,500
from my era grass City and um roll it up

99
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,658
we always call it a troll it up but

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,919
those two were like what everybody would

101
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:00,900
say like that's where everybody

102
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,679
everybody had an account on those pretty

103
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,680
much because that's where everybody

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,659
started during that era and then slowly

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,840
you'd see people migrate but then those

106
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:12,000
the ones that hung out in that area kind

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,979
of never really seemed to go anywhere as

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,319
far as their knowledge or making any

109
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,899
Headway with anything really that's how

110
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,060
I saw it yeah I mean and you know it it

111
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,219
should be said too that like you know

112
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,899
there was different different forums had

113
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,940
different

114
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,918
I don't know different ethics maybe is

115
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,139
the best way to put it yeah you know

116
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,719
some some were more lightly moderated

117
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,460
and things got left up

118
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,560
um you know obviously like hate speech

119
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,000
and and various other aspects was was

120
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,579
eliminated

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,040
um you know or but a lot of times you

122
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:46,019
know unlike IG or whatever

123
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,419
um you know if you didn't like the

124
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,219
threads got let they might get locked if

125
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:52,918
arguments got too heated but they would

126
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,320
typically be left yeah where in today's

127
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:59,039
environment on IG a lot of times people

128
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,199
just get rid of it yeah oh yeah they'll

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,479
just it's all it's all uh what do you

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,220
call that curated it's all curated as

131
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:06,538
soon as it starts going off the rails or

132
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,880
as soon as they start seeing information

133
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,500
they don't want out there yeah um

134
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,180
they'll just delete comments or they'll

135
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,360
delete the whole thread or they'll turn

136
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,038
off comments yeah right away

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,900
um you know and then you know I see mag

138
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,079
you know there was you know there was an

139
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,000
In Crowd and an out crowd

140
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,698
you know definitely I was the app crowd

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,160
I I think I had a record uh for being

142
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,919
the person most banned from every forum

143
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,360
and it it I think that I mean I even had

144
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,299
my own forums back in the day that

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,038
people rocked on you know it got bad I

146
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,139
mean it was interesting in the sense

147
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,879
that like in the beginning an overgrown

148
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,220
cannabis world and stuff I was super

149
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,959
excited and I got on there to share

150
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,340
information without with a bunch of

151
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,019
people

152
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,619
um and then you know but I was always

153
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,478
nervous about doing any kind like you

154
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,399
know I lived in Mendo or whatever so I

155
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,978
didn't really need to like meet new weed

156
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,799
people yeah but I liked learning what

157
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,719
other people far away knew yeah but a

158
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,400
lot of people used it in the DMS to

159
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,020
trade clones and do all this type of

160
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,239
stuff I never really did that I was more

161
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,399
like an in-person kind of kind of guy

162
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,019
yeah um and then when obviously When

163
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,138
Heaven Stairway got in trouble and they

164
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,818
shut all that down yeah I got scared

165
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,259
so

166
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,979
um you know this era that we're going to

167
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:27,180
talk about like 2006 on it really is CSI

168
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:28,680
and Matt's era yeah it really is where

169
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,478
you know I might have been lurking a

170
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,800
little bit and poking around here and

171
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,300
there

172
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,919
um and even some other friends of ours

173
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,740
that aren't going to join like uh our

174
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,060
buddy high and Lonesome oh yeah yeah you

175
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,038
know there there were some people that

176
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,560
were that were extremely active in that

177
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,779
area sure and know a lot of the the who

178
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,720
you know who was who was a jackass who

179
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:52,079
who was kind uh who was a problem back

180
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,819
then you know where stuff came from

181
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,038
and one of the interesting things about

182
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,280
weed is that it reinvents itself every

183
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,259
five or ten years yeah so you get all

184
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,019
these new people coming in and people

185
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,780
get to Rebrand themselves yeah now it's

186
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:09,418
happening every six months it seems yeah

187
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,000
well it's modern fast turnover yeah

188
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,500
modern marketing I mentioned that I

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,079
mentioned this before but it was kind of

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,418
like what the uh what the old deadheads

191
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,939
told me about how dead tour used to be

192
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:23,418
before the Grateful Dead had Touch of

193
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:27,060
Gray a big hit yeah where it was small

194
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:29,698
everybody knew kind of got vetted in you

195
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,598
know things didn't change that much and

196
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,319
then

197
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:37,079
um you know oh my God Big Ups to Danimal

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,419
okay so then and then and then there was

199
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,459
a top they had a top 10 hit and

200
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:44,579
literally hundreds of thousands of new

201
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,500
people showed up yeah and how do you

202
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,639
assimilate them into your community that

203
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,240
fast

204
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,978
yeah thank you yeah you know it becomes

205
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,478
difficult so a lot of times like

206
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:55,918
Old-Timers or whatever they feel

207
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,719
overwhelmed

208
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,758
because like the Norms of their

209
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,680
community and what they could expect you

210
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,020
know and instead of being like a

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,418
respected Elder somebody's like who the

212
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,500
[ __ ] is this guy yeah why do I have to

213
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,318
listen to you

214
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,060
yeah you know where before when it was

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,360
smaller like those people might have had

216
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,280
respect yeah yeah it's a much it did get

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,319
very different and I want to say it

218
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,959
wasn't quite at cookies where everything

219
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,939
took a big swing but it wasn't much long

220
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,620
after cookies came around that that the

221
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,060
Forum the whole idea of forms kind of

222
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,160
changed but I think that also had to do

223
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,259
with Instagram which is also why cookies

224
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,658
kind of even got even more blown up I

225
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,060
think uh social media

226
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:39,240
um yeah the kind of the difference

227
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,199
between the I would say the forums were

228
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,419
mostly writing with some pictures

229
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,300
where Instagram flipped it 180 degrees

230
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:50,939
to being almost all pictures with a

231
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,979
little bit of writing yeah so you see

232
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,839
some of these old write-ups that people

233
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,539
have and their paragraphs and you know

234
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,360
they're like a small essay yeah

235
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:02,879
right where people ask me stuff all the

236
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,139
time on IG and it's really hard because

237
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,720
it's like what are you going to write a

238
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,919
novel in the comments yeah yeah it's

239
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,180
kind of looks like you're trying to

240
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,579
write something that's like this long

241
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,699
like what can I yeah it's like a haiku

242
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,500
yes how can I get my my thing across in

243
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,720
like you know x amount of syllables or

244
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,980
four sentences yeah yeah you kind of

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,899
have to especially if you're on Twitter

246
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,159
right and then and then you end up and

247
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,259
then you end up leaving out a lot of

248
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,120
nuance and detail we're on the Forum era

249
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,120
people could like write three or four

250
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,980
paragraphs each back and forth and some

251
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,899
like empty could write really really

252
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,580
just

253
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,440
bad really bad un illegible stuff for

254
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,019
paragraphs and paragraphs I mean when

255
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,380
you write paragraphs you really realize

256
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:49,080
why we invented punctuation yeah for

257
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,659
sure you know why we invented paragraphs

258
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,120
in the first place spacing periods

259
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,399
commas all the various aspects it really

260
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,519
helps because yeah you know one one of

261
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,639
the things that hurts you online is that

262
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,139
um Nuance gets lost yeah does are you

263
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,240
being sarcastic

264
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,439
yeah being funny what's your body

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,079
language

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,459
you know all those types of things

267
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,199
you know

268
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,299
um yeah that was actually a good point

269
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,160
uh you know in the overgrow era digital

270
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,859
cameras

271
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,259
um you know didn't exist yeah

272
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,720
I mean I was talking I was actually

273
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,159
talking about that in the in the one

274
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,778
that you missed because you were you

275
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,299
know you were otherwise occupied where

276
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:32,578
it was like people documenting their

277
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,859
stuff really Advanced a lot more when

278
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:38,099
digital cameras came out oh yeah and

279
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,259
then exponentially wants uh phones had

280
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,720
cameras yeah once phones had cameras

281
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,419
it's all bets off the era where you had

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,700
to get your own stuff developed

283
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,860
that's unsadly it's not oh yeah I can

284
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,500
only imagine it's not very documented I

285
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,820
mean I was it I was at csi's house I

286
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,139
don't know half a year ago or something

287
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,680
like that we were looking through a

288
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:02,578
couple of boxes of his um uh Polaroids

289
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,859
right yeah but they fade yeah that cat

290
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,059
sucks

291
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,100
you know and maybe if he would have kept

292
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,659
them in some kind of like a perfectly

293
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,399
sealed environment with the right

294
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,379
humidity or something like that you know

295
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,740
but yeah you're looking at Polaroids

296
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,659
from 95 or six or seven or whatever and

297
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,278
a lot of them the colors are bleeding

298
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,539
into each other and it's hard to make

299
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,000
it's not

300
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,620
it's not you know it's not shark

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,139
yeah

302
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,578
you know yeah that sucks that sucks bad

303
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,500
I would have never guessed that until he

304
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,899
told me that yeah I mean you know he's

305
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,578
got a couple shoe boxes full yeah and I

306
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,958
was busting his chops to get him [ __ ]

307
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,338
scanned I was like you got to get those

308
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,958
scanned at least for history he's like

309
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,720
don't do any good

310
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:46,199
I mean I you know I had my I had my my

311
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,000
uh my first daughter in 09 you know and

312
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,220
I think and I can look back on my phone

313
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,039
I think you know the first real camera

314
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,800
on an iPhone came out in 08

315
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,120
oh wow wow I don't remember yeah later

316
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,458
wait

317
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,919
you know and and that's kind of that

318
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,659
that was a revolution in itself oh I'm

319
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,860
sure because then you can just pull it

320
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,480
out of your pocket and be like there's

321
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,919
my weed plant click

322
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,240
it's always amazing that with all these

323
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,360
cell phones we don't really see many

324
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,220
like real documented UFO picks I know

325
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,480
I'm it's kind of off tangent but I just

326
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,259
thought about that

327
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,120
well I will say as a as as a you know

328
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,039
somebody who's pulled a lot of tarps in

329
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,299
their day

330
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,219
that you know a lot of times when you

331
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,379
pull tarp on you you're doing light

332
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,720
depth you're you're pulling tarp at six

333
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,939
or seven o'clock at night right yeah and

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,278
then you go back out there after dark

335
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,040
which in June might be 9 30 or 10

336
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,539
o'clock at night right so pull the tarp

337
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,219
off so everything can breathe because

338
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,078
you only want to darken it for as much

339
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,759
as you need to right oh yeah and you

340
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,219
don't want to trap in all that moisture

341
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,720
and all that right so you got to go out

342
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,540
there and you know Mendo or whatever in

343
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,100

00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:57,659
most beautiful Skies the most beautiful

345
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,480

00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,879
show you what my eyes could see oh yeah

347
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,459

349
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,479
just never and I'd go online and look

00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,060
how do I take better night photos yeah

351
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,700
and it's just not a camera with like a

352
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:17,638
nice lens and you know the ability to

353
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,379
like you know it's just not it's just

354
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,519
meant to show dicks and tits that's all

355
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,278

fellas ladies you know and yeah and so

357
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,519
you know there's there's an aspect to

358
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,860
that where it's like I can bet like if

359
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,659
you can't see like nobody can imagine

360
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,560
how beautiful this full Moon is tonight

361
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:36,480
yeah and you can't capture that well

362
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,979
how are you gonna capture like I'm sure

363
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,600
there's like this is there's a weird

364
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,519
thing in the sky it's really not rich

365
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,740
you know especially back in 08 or 09 how

366
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,740
am I going to pull out my two or two and

367
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,860
a half megapixel camera yeah on my phone

368
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,980
yeah I'm gonna like capture it

369
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,860
no you know it took a long time for

370
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,899
phones to even begin to catch up to like

371
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,959
what 35 millimeter could do you're

372
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:07,139
busting my skeptical comments not so

373
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:10,979
you know refreshing my skepticism

374
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:13,320
I fully believe that there are aliens

375
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,940
I just disbelieve most people that tell

376
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,420
try to tell me a bunch of facts about

377
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,720
them yeah yeah there are I just don't

378
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:24,419
know if they've ever been near Earth you

379
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,278
know like I I have I that that's where

380
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,979
my skepticism comes in when people start

381
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:31,139
writing getting like very long YouTubes

382
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,860

391
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,619
episode when you weren't here yeah I was

even stuff from some of the 90s yeah and

395
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,120
it was a royal [ __ ] and nobody cared

396
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,920
about it and I and I searched for years

yeah you know and it was really hard and

400
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,778
now within the last five years as

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,639

so yeah we were just talking about

421
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,560
um the different you know what was kind

422
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,778
of going around post 2006 it was the end

423
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,659
of the overgrow era end of the Cannabis

424
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,039
World era and maybe maybe uh you could

425
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,219
talk about some of the things that you

426
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:23,278
saw during those those uh that integral

427
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,800
period between the end of overgrow and

428
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,000
the beginning of things like the farm

429
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,639
foreign

430
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,440
what kind of strains were people [ __ ]

431
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,480
with around then what was the hot [ __ ]

432
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:39,120
uh are are you talking about like 06 on

433
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,980
oh six to like 006 to 08 somewhere in

434
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,839
there yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I think

435
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,839
that's when chemdog really started

436
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,899
becoming popular yeah

437
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,660
um Kim d uh came out I I think I

438
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,379
honestly think that that's the year uh

439
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:59,338
you know Mass G uh posted up on icy mag

440
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,740
although yeah that threat is gone oh is

441
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,959
that thread going I did my research I

442
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,400
think it's like is that the the creation

443
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,279
of sour D1

444
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,120
no no no that was the overgrow that was

445
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,119
okay

446
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:16,198
so yeah that that's well long gone

447
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,599
unless somebody has a archives yeah who

448
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,939
would have that [ __ ] I don't know

449
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,859

time like in the in that end of overgrow

453

494
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,959
they're they're I did have some friends

495
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,939
that I mean we didn't use I did we

496
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,860
didn't know anything about any of the

497
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,558
any of the chems you could spray on

498
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,918
Plants but people used to try to torture

499
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:40,798
their plants to get them to free if it

500
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,720
was if you knew it could herb sometimes

501
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,519
you could put it into too small of a pot

502
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,220
you could let it get dry you could beat

503
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,619
it up a bit you could try to collect see

504
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,079
if it could throw some that was like the

505
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,939
that was like our our way of

506
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,000
you know right can you beat it up enough

507
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,220
to get something off it remember uh

508
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,319
Soma's Soma's way you just flare them

509
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,100
out for like 80 or 90 days and get a

510
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,279
couple bananas yeah

511
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:09,298
rhodolization yeah yeah

512
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,839
and I don't know where you got that term

513
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:16,440
from for it but yeah I remember yeah

514
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:18,359
yeah he's a special guy actually I did

515
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,558
like as when his book came out or

516
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,779
whatever I do like the Soma beds

517
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,460
I don't know that they were interesting

518
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,000
they were interesting they're just

519
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,240
they're just deep indoor beds on Wheels

520
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,400
you know is basically what they were

521
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,319
um you know with with you know some

522
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,480
drainage in the bottom and some layering

523
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,099
you know maybe they have some rocks and

524
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,798
they have some like and then they have a

525
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:46,619
layer of of uh ground cover or something

526
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,240
and then you put soil on top and and

527
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,178
they have never seen

528
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,519
huh they had the air tubes on them in

529
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,400
all four corners where the air came down

530
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,798
to the lower Roots you would put like

531
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,140
big pieces of PVC with holes drilled in

532
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,400
and you would put those on the side and

533
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,980
those would go all the way in the

534
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,659
corners to the bottom yeah so that you

535
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,460
would actually and that would connect to

536
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:11,159
the gravel at the bottom so that you

537
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,400
could bring air yep yeah yeah it wasn't

538
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,400
the worst idea no no no I've done that

539
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,919
much and especially for well it's not so

540
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,840
much you had to go trees you know I mean

541
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,038
you know look now look at look at a

542
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,158
bunch of you could you could actually

543
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:29,279
grow a bed with it you know homie Style

544
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,320
with 25 or 30 plants if you wanted yeah

545
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,759
right right right you know and then you

546
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,939
didn't have to worry about individual

547
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:38,220
ones dying right right because you just

548
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,860
water the bed and everything stays alive

549
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,759
oh yeah I used to use those no drain

550
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:47,219
beds way back in a 2000 or so and no

551
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,980
drain beds it's just shallow like six

552
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,900
inch deep beds you know

553
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,259
how'd that worked out

554
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,419
I did pretty good yeah yeah yeah

555
00:21:55,259 --> 00:22:00,240
um definitely some interesting stuff

556
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,960
that was back in my not so organic days

557
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,440
it's not so organic

558
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,500
organic not so organic

559
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
I mean I I used I used to know this used

560
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,640
to be pretty funny where I used to know

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,240
a lot of guys in Mendo that were organic

562
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,340
like April through August

563
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,079
and then come August they're like not or

564
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,119
September they're not quite seeing their

565
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,339
buds get as big as they want

566
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,619
and then they figure like well what's

567
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,720
one big tub of pink powder gonna really

568
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:33,359
do to my organic it's it's basically

569
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,179
organic yeah yeah a little just a couple

570
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,298
a couple doses of the zero fifty Thirty

571
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,159
it's gonna get me where I need to be and

572
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,259
it's gonna make it happy and I've been

573
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,059
organic for five months already you know

574
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,759
so it'll all flush out at the end and

575
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:49,440
it's definitely still organic uh yeah

576
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,960
that stuff was rough

577
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,298
yeah bud blaster

578
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,298
three cheers for grow more yeah

579
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:03,740
but Blaster was the was the the Canadian

580
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,900
heady version yeah

581
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,279
it was Canadian it was it was it was it

582
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,440
was one of those you know powdered

583
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,700
whatever it was all this it was all the

584
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,919
same there was a bunch of people that

585
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,538
came out with zero fifty Thirty and

586
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,600
tried to make it seem like their Sierra

587
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:20,158
50 30 was special

588
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,779
the one thing I'll say about the the bud

589
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,360
Blaster is that

590
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,639
they had a they had their own special

591
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,500
grinder

592
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,380
so their powder was super fine and it

593
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,419
actually dissolved

594
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,100
some of the cheap stuff you get there in

595
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,538
like a thousand gallon tank or whatever

596
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:38,459
and you're up on a ladder and you're

597
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:40,200
dumping stuff like that in there and

598
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,240
then you get some softballs at the

599
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,120
bottom that you're like wondering how to

600
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,500
hit with a stick to break up

601
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:49,439
because it wouldn't actually dissolve

602
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,778
yeah you know all right so but that's

603
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,480
off topic you know I suppose you should

604
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:56,759
probably ratchet back around

605
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,679
um so we gotta convince we gotta

606
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:03,140
convince Caleb and Matt to talk because

607

00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,519
talking about the chem dog you know

658
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:19,619
there was an aspect where the reason why

659
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:23,099
you know somebody like you know skunk VA

660
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,798
has his name or chemdog 101 or any of

661
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:28,139
these things is because at some form or

662
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,579
another on icmag or whatever it was the

663
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,860
first time these things started getting

664
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,859
argued about and debated

665
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,699
Yeah by people outside and a lot of

666
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,158
times

667
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,960
what happens too is that these things

668
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,360
become references because then you've

669
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,519
got this guy comes out and says this

670
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,740
thing on I see mag at this year

671
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,500
and then three years later on whatever

672
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:53,579
on roll it up let's say he's saying this

673
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,679
and now on IG he said this and this

674
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:57,359
you know and they always they always

675
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,620
want to be like this is the most current

676
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,339
story this is what you should believe

677
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,839
yeah yeah and in some cases those forms

678
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:05,759
don't exist anymore and they're very

679
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,759
fortunate that they don't and you know

680
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,759
one of the one of the ways that uh CSI

681
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,859
got his reputation as inspecta is he was

682
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,460
really good at at using your own words

683
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,459
against you

684
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,058
but I just mean in the sense of someone

685
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,278
would like confidently say this this

686
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:25,139
this this and this and then he would be

687
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,798
like well why did you write

688
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:31,500
in your own words that faster this right

689
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,839
how do you make these two things come

690
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,278
together I've got a bunch of swerve

691
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,720
quotes I can share oh yeah

692
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,798
you know and and that's a lot of things

693
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,319
most people probably don't even know who

694
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,759
swerve is but there's been there's been

695
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:46,798
a bunch of people

696
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,319
you know that come the you know flashing

697
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,359
the pants that come and go yeah they

698
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,700
come up they have their moment they they

699
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,859
they spew a bunch of [ __ ] they make a

700
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,019
bunch of money all of a sudden their

701
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:00,119
stories start to implode

702
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,460
right yeah

703
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,199
and you know and in some cases they

704
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,620
Rebrand themselves

705
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,798
and so again to the to the new batch

706
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,719
right right you know

707
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,220
um who I looked up to is going to be a

708
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,419
lot different than maybe who Caleb

709
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,759
looked up to because when I first

710
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,740
started coming in it was way different

711
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,019
than when Caleb started coming in you

712
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,480
know so who like who are you looking up

713
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,339
to during those years or who who is who

714
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,740
do you think was influencing really well

715
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,599
that that had some respect during those

716
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,839
years

717
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:37,259
um I mean I liked you know just Just for

718
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,959
information you know alone I liked Joe

719
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:42,079
brand I liked uh you know chem dog math

720
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,679
G uh

721
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:49,500
uh you know skunk VA yeah and then on

722
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,140
like the the OG side of things you know

723
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,079
I was I always liked uh you know big

724
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,419
Ricky uh he was old family red back then

725
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:00,058
I actually a lot of people don't even

726
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,700
know but uh I named my old family purple

727
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:05,519
my first TK hybrid kind of after his old

728
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,880
handle old family red you know oh I

729
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,918
didn't even know that that's cool

730
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,260
yeah I gave him a lot of credit

731
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,700
um you know Chrome that was those were

732
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:17,158
the years Chrome was starting out with

733
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,159
the white you know yeah he actually was

734
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,380
growing some of my my hybrids

735
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,020
um and then he introduced the white when

736
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,580
he was growing them so yeah that's when

737
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,538
that started

738
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:30,599
um

739
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:34,379
I I think I was mostly into Bubba's ogs

740
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:37,259
and chem dogs back then yeah but uh

741
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,640
what what were your your main main

742
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,398
interest though

743
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,899
so when I popped in you know like Shanti

744
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,359
baba

745
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:47,459
um was still pretty big and and still

746
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,740
had a good name a lot of the stuff I was

747
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,899
looking at when I came in was was Dutch

748
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,579
stuff I really didn't focus a lot on

749
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,798
Americans at the time because it just

750
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,720
didn't I wasn't hip to it you know I

751
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,158
hadn't right when I came in I wasn't hit

752
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,480
to the fact that all those dudes were

753
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,399
white labeling and most of the Americans

754
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,140
were making their seeds or Spanish or

755
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,879
actually back then I don't even know who

756
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,360
was making the [ __ ] seeds you

757
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,940
know right but yeah I mean it was very

758
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,379
different I mean uh Greenhouse hadn't

759
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,179
been totally trashed it was still kind

760
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,659
of under the radar for new people at the

761
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:21,960
time that that they were doing anything

762
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:24,360
you know untoward DNA was massive during

763
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,220
those years uh they were why I started

764
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,599
doing six seeds a pack because their

765
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,860
[ __ ] was six seeds a pack and they were

766
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,839
the ones selling the most so I was like

767
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,719
okay I guess that's what you do you know

768
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,879
what I mean right um yeah and then sub

769
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,519
cool of course it just started [ __ ]

770
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,580
taking off and I was fortunate that I

771
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,619
met Sunny Chiba very early on so I

772
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,839
learned very quickly oh maybe that guy

773
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:48,778
isn't someone I should be looking at for

774
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,879
breeding tips you know right right it

775
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,440
took me a while but I got it but yeah

776
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,520
that's it was it was a much different

777
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,919
take

778
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,079
yeah it's interesting then because

779
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,480
that's kind of when everybody first came

780
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,519
out of the Shadows yeah and you could

781
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,839
walk out of the Shadows with any stories

782
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,359
you wanted

783
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,359
about yourself or the strains or

784
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,579
whatever else and a lot of times you

785
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,979
were the only person

786
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,839
um you know from Sam's man on

787
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,579
yeah you were the only Pro you were the

788
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,759
only person telling the story about

789
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:24,418
those strengths right right I mean do

790
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:26,398
you remember huh the audience was so

791
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:30,019
small finding people who are actually

792
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:32,518
there you know was was very difficult

793
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:34,019
yeah it was it was a lot smaller than

794
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,419
now I just don't you think people that

795
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:38,000
that came later can grasp how small the

796
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:41,240
community was

797
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,038
and how slow information was

798
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,899
now it's pretty rapid fire

799
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,419
right you know and a lot of people

800
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:50,398
connect all the time

801
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:54,120
um oh yeah somebody said crunch bubble

802
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,918
you know uh that guy I mean he that guy

803
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,298
used to move massive amounts of what was

804
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,340
it Blue Dot

805
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:01,558
through the third floor in Oakland you

806
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:05,418
know he had all those warehouses of 600

807
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,500
watt hps's on hydro tables

808
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:09,960
bumping out a bunch of stuff for third

809
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,778
floor but it was you know what what's

810
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,460
funny about that guy is that some of

811
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:16,319
those pictures were like some of the

812
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,200
first Warehouse scenes that people were

813
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,960
willing to like throw up on IG on on the

814
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,840
internet yeah most people were growing

815
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,000
in closets or bedrooms or greenhouses or

816
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,038
in the woods or wherever and all of a

817
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,019
sudden you see a 40 lighter

818
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,640
right and for a lot of people that was

819
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,819
the first time

820
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,000
right it might look rudimentary now

821
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,740
yeah now but yeah but even just then 05

822
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,440
or 06 or something like that you know

823
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,240
finding people and I think too that like

824
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,880
what most people don't understand maybe

825
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,819
is that a lot of the a lot of the

826
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,380
Breeders like that got famous later like

827
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:55,379
a couple people on the show or whatever

828
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:59,399
like almost all the Breeders were

829
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:02,419
European or American or Canadian yeah

830
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:05,339
right and the people that were working

831
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:08,840
breeding in America were generally doing

832
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:08,839
it through friendship circles

833
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:14,519
there was a lot of trading and Via DM

834
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,120
amongst friends and amongst

835
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,798
contemporaries it wasn't like like on

836
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:22,259
you know at least from what I remember

837
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:25,200
it wasn't like oh I've got a big drop

838
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,419
coming next Friday here's the fifth

839
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,519
here's the 15 here's the names I made up

840
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,380
for him here's the hybrids here's where

841
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,759
you can get them here's how we're gonna

842
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,460
sell them all

843
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,019
it was like you know you'd trade scenes

844
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,058
when you saw people or if people were

845
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:42,000
trade selling them via DM or something

846
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,879
like that like but it was different

847
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,740
um I remember as far as Americans went

848
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,019
there was not a lot of Americans doing

849
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,419
direct sales on websites you would never

850
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,640
really see that like it was all done you

851
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,380
know DMS or like on weird little auction

852
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,759
sites they were floating around but

853
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,320
other than that there wasn't a really

854
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,480
good way to Market yourself as an

855
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,819
American breederer without mostly giving

856
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,058
seeds away to people I mean did you have

857
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:08,639
that experience CSI

858
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:12,659
I I didn't get involved in any of I

859
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,820
wanted to back in the 06 08 era I looked

860
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,159
into it but

861
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,139
um you know I was I was still way too

862
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,599
paranoid to do any of that stuff yeah

863
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:24,599
I I should have done it you know like

864
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,119
you know DNA and sub cool and hell even

865
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,780
swerve you know yeah

866
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,179
you know uh I mean all those guys you

867
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,579
know made huge names because there

868
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,559
wasn't competition yeah there was no

869
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,599
competition you didn't really have to

870
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,779
have a whole lot of talent to be very

871
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,079
successful so what you said Mr Soul

872
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,820
handled all of sssc in the 80s

873
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,679
foreign

874
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,260
well you know so I mean what's

875
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,820
interesting about that is that you know

876
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,480
there's been a lot there's been a lot of

877
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,280
talk about American sssc right yeah and

878
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,820
you know Matt and myself got to

879
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,339
interview uh the owner uh who was very

880
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:09,000
cool and you know all that kind of stuff

881
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:11,338
got put to rest yeah hard it wasn't

882
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,619
there wasn't any American help no but

883
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:16,139
not for maneuver but it goes but it goes

884
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,880
to show how you know in our world you

885
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:19,920
can kind of step out of the shadows and

886
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,160
be like oh I mean there was a lot of

887
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,599
people uh that you know they came out of

888
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,480
the shadows and they were the first time

889
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,980
that people were like you know oh I'm I

890
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,079
this is my cut

891
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,699
yeah and then it turns out that they

892
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,460
just got the cut early

893
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,960
yeah but they got a few years of like oh

894
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,240
if you want to use my cut you got to

895
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,579
give me 50 of the proceeds of the seeds

896
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,159
or you gotta pay me or you gotta this or

897
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:47,160
you got a that it's my work it's my my

898
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,420
my and then it comes out later that they

899
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,759
just got it from these other people

900
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,960
early but they were the first one to go

901
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,540
public

902
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,338
right you know and a lot of times what

903
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,079
happened is is that the first person to

904
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:59,699
go public

905
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,859
um you know got credit

906
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,419
yeah

907
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:05,159
yeah you know

908
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,740
um you know they got credit and their

909
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,358
story was the story for a minute and

910
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:11,699
sometimes other people would get upset

911
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,039
and get online and start you know I mean

912
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,379
I actually think that's kind of what got

913
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:19,320
uh you know you were talking about uh

914
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,980
Kim that's kind of what got cam online

915
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,359
was you know skunk VA got online a bit

916
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,099
you know and started talking about

917
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,259
different things

918
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,460
and then people were like oh my weed's

919
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,460
famous I should talk about it

920
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:36,539
that got Joe brand and and Peabody and

921
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,220
other people that hadn't really met up

922
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:40,679
or like even linked or even realized

923
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:41,639
what was going on after 15 years to

924
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,598
connect

925
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:48,960
right because of stories 707 seed bank

926
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,619
uh Shabbat he's the one who you know got

927
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,720
uh skunk VA on to overgrow and icy mag

928
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,059
to actually post about that stuff

929
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,699
otherwise I think there'd be a

930
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,880
completely different chem dog history oh

931
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:05,578
yeah if he hadn't done that you know do

932
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,920
we remember what the very very first

933
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,880
claim of the chem dog seat not

934
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,519
necessarily the first one people

935
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,200
remember but the very first claims of

936
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,940
Kim dog who was the first one to claim

937
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,439
that string was it even Greg or were

938
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,000
there other people popping up as it was

939
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,639
getting popular going that's mine I've

940
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,338
read that [ __ ] I don't remember anybody

941
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,838
claiming it

942
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:28,320
um lots of people claiming they had the

943
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:30,539
91 or oh yeah yeah sure and it's just

944
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,940
like well I don't know how all these

945
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,679
different cuts could be the right one oh

946
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,480
you know because it's purple that's how

947
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,598
you know when it perks

948
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,599
I I saw a few chem dog cuts and they

949
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,599
they uh uh some of them look like a mass

950
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,820
Super Skunk chem dogs yeah

951
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,940
but that that just basically means

952
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,338
somebody bought some weed that was was

953
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,740
called chem dog and it had some seeds in

954
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:58,320
it and whatever had pollinated that chem

955
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:00,118
dog you know chem dog's not a bad

956
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
hermaphrodite just by itself I mean not

957
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,858
so nice

958
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,559
you know no and so usually if you find

959
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:09,900
seeds in your chem dog you know it's

960
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,420
been pollinated by something else

961
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,858
yeah well there was there was also a

962
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,599
thing too that was that was really

963
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,578
confusing I think and this isn't

964
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,220
anything against Greg or chem dog but

965
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,500
you know it's it's like for people that

966
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:24,838
want specific lineages

967
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,480
he was pretty famous for you when you

968
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,460
buy weed you're buying chem dog weed

969
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,920
from chemdoc

970
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,760
it didn't really matter exactly what it

971
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,579
was

972
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,140
it was weed from chemdog and so I think

973
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,760
that created confusion too because

974
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:40,618
everyone was like oh it's this one

975
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,240
specific thing

976
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,280
you know

977
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,019
um but it really was chemdoc yeah just

978
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,300
branding I mean back then branding was

979
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,159
branding you know it was it was it was

980
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,339
early it was an early form of branding

981
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,199
yeah for sure you know and people

982
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:57,900
weren't and a lot of these guys were

983
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,419
young and nobody knew especially then

984
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,800
when things first started getting famous

985
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't think anybody knew that some of

986
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,940
these strains were going to be so

987
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,559
lastingly famous

988
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,960
so a lot of times they wrote down

989
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,299
various stories or this or that and they

990
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,519
didn't really expect it to get become

991
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,619
part of Canon or become part of the the

992
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,940
fabric of the tail

993
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,380
and then they have to look back and

994
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,480
defend it

995
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,160
you know

996
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,838
um and you know it's hard for people

997
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,159
sometimes to say you know my memory was

998
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:27,119
a little that's what I remembered at the

999
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,858
time

1000
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,358
you know after more after more

1001
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,460
information came out and I talked to

1002
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:34,559
more friends I kind of revised a little

1003
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,880
bit because other people had it's hard

1004
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,559
for people to say that a lot of times

1005
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,599
people would dig in their heels

1006
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,219
yeah and then you've got two or three or

1007
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,519
four versions of the story and you're

1008
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:46,199
trying to figure out which one works

1009
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,420
which one is the most believable

1010
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:51,239
right right you know what what's your

1011
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,039
favorite wildest story

1012
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,959
um from The Forum errors that you knew I

1013
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,119
mean you that that you knew was kind of

1014
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,039
like that's too [ __ ] stupid to even

1015
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,780
be possible do you have any that stick

1016
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:04,818
out where you're like that was a bold

1017
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:08,099
[ __ ] clave and really what wonky

1018
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:11,159
what comes to mind when I say that uh

1019
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:13,019
okay so I hate to keep bringing up my

1020
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:15,299
boy swerve

1021
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:18,119
it doesn't really have a whole lot to do

1022
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:22,200
with him but the guy he got pretty much

1023
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:24,660
most all of his early OG cuts from in

1024
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,279
like 0607.

1025
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:32,639
um this guy

1026
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:34,500
uh had an account on icmag and then he

1027
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,179
made up another account and I think this

1028
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,599
was an 07.

1029
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:42,059
and uh he made up another account

1030
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,338
pretending to be his own Mentor you know

1031
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,920
with all the same spelling errors all

1032
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,779
the same you know type Styles all that

1033
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,780
and

1034
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,880
he made a whole thread on it and acted

1035
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,519
like you know he was the original

1036
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,559
creator of the OG Kush blah blah blah

1037
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:00,539
and his boy right here his little

1038
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:04,559
student you know he's he's best student

1039
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,239
I ever had and four of our boy and we we

1040
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,219
hooked him up we laced him with all

1041
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,739
those those cuts we've held since the

1042
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:13,618
80s

1043
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:17,098
yeah that there's still that story on on

1044
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,858
uh icy Mac it's still oh my God you know

1045
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:22,980
and I'm I'm up in there with a bunch of

1046
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:26,400
other clowns just laughing away

1047
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,679
stupid you know but that that one right

1048
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,619
there was it was pretty much the tops

1049
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:34,858
for for me back in those days I got one

1050
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,980
for you I got one for you uh little old

1051
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:40,139
lady with Asian fantasy oh that was a

1052
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:44,039
really good one too I like it was a good

1053
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:45,539
one yeah yeah that one was was it uh

1054
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,639
there was a string called Asian Fantasy

1055
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,259
Made famous I think I think it's fair to

1056
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,358
say about the can of Bible Jason King

1057
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,280
pretty much made that strain very much

1058
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,039
so yeah known it wasn't a well-known

1059
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,079
strain I don't think was it no no no no

1060
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,420
no

1061
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,220
and you know he he talked about the

1062
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,639
Rarity and how this guy never lets it

1063
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:08,879
out blah blah blah few years later

1064
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,318
um a person that we we know who it was

1065
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,380
but I don't think he'll ever admit it

1066
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:17,039
right went on and tried to say that she

1067
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,920
was the the wife of the man who held

1068
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,420
Asian fantasy and he has died and she

1069
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,000
wants to get those genetics out there

1070
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,159
you know and ended up I think he's

1071
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,440
pretty sure it was NYC kid

1072
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,358
um kind of big upping himself trying to

1073
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,358
give himself some provenance on a cut he

1074
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:35,639
never had access to well we don't

1075
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,078
honestly we don't know that part of it

1076
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:38,358
because

1077
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,960
who

1078
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:46,619
have you or anybody ever seen this Asian

1079
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:51,059
fantasy keyword fantasy outside of the

1080
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:54,720
candle Bible and NYC kid and his crew no

1081
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:57,000
I mean it's kind of a fancy yeah yeah

1082
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,379
and yeah and in fact African black magic

1083
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,358
I mean there's some there's some

1084
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,338
pictures of it or whatever but I mean

1085
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:05,219
Jason King even talked about how homie

1086
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:07,318
wouldn't give it out to anyone and you

1087
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:10,019
know was it was a massive hoarder of it

1088
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,940
you know and so there's an aspect to it

1089
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:14,219
there too where it's like people people

1090
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,019
can hoard something so much that it

1091
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:18,480
doesn't become famous

1092
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:21,239
yeah right you know because nobody ever

1093
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,500
sees it like before before this forum

1094
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,899
time that you were talking about there

1095
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,699
was probably like you know four or five

1096
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,220
people or something in California that

1097
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:32,039
had the chem 91. oh yeah and someone

1098
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:35,699
just said I have Asian fantasy s1s from

1099
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:37,800
th Gods so he's still doing it Go NYC

1100
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,539
kid you go but yeah I mean it was like

1101
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,940
one of those things where like if you

1102
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,800
know if if OG Kush if some of the if

1103
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,260
some of these famous things don't slip

1104
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,240
out and people don't start cropping them

1105
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,160
you know there was an aspect where it

1106
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,098
was like for a long time there was only

1107
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,980
four or five garages pumping chem 91.

1108
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:58,680
mm-hmm yeah so like every you know so

1109
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,760
how much weed is that not very much it

1110
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,980
doesn't really give you very much

1111
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,500
opportunity to try it doesn't really get

1112
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,800
give you an opportunity for like a fad

1113
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,420
to you know like if OG hadn't snuck out

1114
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,579
if all those guys hadn't been money

1115
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,920
hungry down there in L.A and it had

1116
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,359
snuck out it probably wouldn't have had

1117
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,838
that kind of impact

1118
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,759
yeah because it has to be there

1119
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:22,619
you have to be able to get that even

1120
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,920
even if you have to pay a lot for it you

1121
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,599
do have to be able to access it

1122
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,240
right so Asian fantasy is one of those

1123
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,359
things where like it you know

1124
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,338
um it never got out and then so as a

1125
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,960
result of that it allowed scammers to be

1126
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:38,639
like this is it

1127
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,960
right and how could you tell the

1128
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,460
difference

1129
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,519
hey um

1130
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,920
you know you you still you still buddies

1131
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,838
with the with old Jason

1132
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,639
Mr King

1133
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,639
um I haven't spoken to him in a minute

1134
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,838
but we're cool yeah he lives on Maui I

1135
00:44:53,639 --> 00:45:00,358
know uh I wonder if you can uh ask him

1136
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:03,779
kind of maybe some because I talked to

1137
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:07,799
him before I like met you met you yeah

1138
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:10,079
you know he he uh he affirmed that you

1139
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,880
know all my information was right and

1140
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,818
then he was like where'd you where'd you

1141
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,800
find all this stuff out you know

1142
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:18,358
I mean he might know some some

1143
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,280
background details that you know

1144
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,460
definitely didn't make it into the book

1145
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,780
about yeah I bet one of the one I've

1146
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,280
been actually thinking about reaching

1147
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,740
out and talking to him because one of

1148
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,880
the things that's interesting is that he

1149
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:35,098
probably has a [ __ ] ton of pictures

1150
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,019
uh of weed from myself and my and some

1151
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,880
and friends and then people that I don't

1152
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:40,920
know obviously too but

1153
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,079
um that didn't make it in the book yeah

1154
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,818
because you know you might take you know

1155
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,800
dozens or hundreds of pictures or

1156
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:49,500
something and then two make it

1157
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,519
yeah you pick a couple

1158
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:55,318
um you know uh and and all that but he

1159
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,818
um you know and I think I think the

1160
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:59,480
Asian fantasy that he was talking about

1161
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:59,480
was in Hawaii

1162
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,619
I want to say I remember and I I could

1163
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,358
be totally wrong so maybe I shouldn't

1164
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:08,838
say it but I think I think Bodie knows

1165
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:11,940
the Asian fantasy person maybe

1166
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:15,059
I might be wrong hmm

1167
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,800
oh no I'm gonna ask him so figure it out

1168
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,440
I mean to me it's one of the it's it's

1169
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,500
one of those like legendary strains you

1170
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,900
know that like just never I mean you

1171
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,900
know I'll mention another one do any of

1172
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,519
you guys have any uh any um uh

1173
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,639
experience with Elvis

1174
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,920
yes yes but I don't know if it was I

1175
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,598
don't know how real it was it was just a

1176
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,159
cut called Elvis because there's some

1177
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,680
really famous stuff out there that just

1178
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,539
it was never in my crew never in like

1179
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,098
the extended Circles of cruise and you

1180
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:46,139
hear about them for a long time and it

1181
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:49,440
got famous in various aspects but it's

1182
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:52,379
just like you know I also thought I had

1183
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,079
Albert Walker too though so there is

1184
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,818
that you know like who knows who knows

1185
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,800
never got it from a good source that

1186
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:01,800
that could say yes this is where I got

1187
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,960
it none of that [ __ ] and last one I had

1188
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,060
I passed off to skunk bastard flex and I

1189
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,920
don't think he backed it up and your

1190
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:11,519
Albert Walker was the orangey one right

1191
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,318
yep Diego Walker yeah good old day go

1192
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,219
yeah

1193
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:16,079
um

1194
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:17,759
did you ever see the mothership come

1195
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,839
through I can't remember if you said

1196
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:24,540
yeah uh-huh yeah so I told this story

1197
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:28,858
before but like it got mailed to one of

1198
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:30,358
our spots uh-huh so uh Jason King's I

1199
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:32,098
don't think it's Shady to say this but

1200
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:35,159
his girlfriend at the time was this

1201
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:38,039
chick named Rebecca yeah and she was

1202
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:41,699
from Asheville area of North Carolina

1203
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:44,400
and so she you know he used to Rave

1204
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:46,199
about that cut all the time and so she

1205
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,338
finally got some of her friends to send

1206
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:51,239
it to us

1207
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:52,679
yeah right and dude it was like uh our

1208
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,139
Buddy Holly Lonesome has a terrible

1209
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,759
story uh but

1210
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,799
um it was kind of like that in the sense

1211
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,660
where I was expecting to get this tiny

1212
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,240
little box with some clones

1213
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:05,639
and we got this box that was like you

1214
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:07,799
know this big by two feet tall or

1215
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:10,379
whatever and it was two Mothership

1216
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,460
plants in one gallon pots with steaks

1217
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:16,500
and each one was about 18 inches tall

1218
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,179
in O3 or something like that and it was

1219
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,099
like so all those pictures in the can of

1220
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:22,379
Bible that you see of Mothership

1221
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:24,960
those all came from those two moms that

1222
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,220
got mailed to us yeah and then we mom

1223
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,679
those out

1224
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:30,299
and uh you know it got they got grown at

1225
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,578
Eddie laps and they got grown to various

1226
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,960
friends houses and stuff like that so I

1227
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,519
actually had I actually I had the

1228
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,318
mothership for four or five years I

1229
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:41,338
think

1230
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:44,159
um and uh it wasn't I think it was a

1231
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,299
super unique plant uh it wasn't one of

1232
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,980
them I didn't have it didn't have the

1233
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,480
nicest flavor I didn't really like the

1234
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,760
flavor that much but it had a pretty

1235
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,338
cool high and it did this weird thing

1236
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,020
where it would fall half over but then

1237
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:57,299
hold itself up

1238
00:48:55,019 --> 00:49:00,420
so like you know how most branches if

1239
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,460
they flop they flop it would like flop

1240
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,318
but then it would like raise itself up

1241
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,099
and it would grow sideways through your

1242
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,739
garden

1243
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,818
hmm almost kind of a little like train

1244
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,578
wreck

1245
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:14,519
it would yeah it would catch itself

1246
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:17,160
and and just like and it had like these

1247
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,800
it was a really odd sativa

1248
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,960
um it had thin leaves and it was big

1249
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,780
branchy thing

1250
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,059
um but you know I mean I honestly like

1251
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,920
compared to all the other [ __ ] we've

1252
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:31,920
been talking about like Bubbas and chems

1253
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,119
and you know super skunk it was it was a

1254
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,480
little Mitzy

1255
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,980
you know uh in all reality but it was

1256
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,019
one of those things that probably like

1257
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,818
was genetically very different

1258
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,858
than everything else

1259
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:46,500
so I like I like you know we like those

1260
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:49,019
weird things yeah real quick to touch

1261
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,818
back on Elvis since you were you were on

1262
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:54,480
THC Farmers stuff for a long time right

1263
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,199
Caleb or at least attentive to it

1264
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,179
um

1265
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,739
I was on the outskirts of the devil's

1266
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:01,618
Harvest crew

1267
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:03,179
um back in those days too and uh there

1268
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:06,358
was there were some of those guys that

1269
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:09,299
one circulated through that crew a good

1270
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:11,880
bit and it it started uh I think erock

1271
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:15,539
from maybe like I don't know if I should

1272
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:19,079
say a stay eh that's a long time uh

1273
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:22,079
you know uh I think he's he's circulated

1274
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,420
Elvis for a while through there I

1275
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,019
wouldn't be surprised if a doctor maybe

1276
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,338
had grown it because he uh he was he was

1277
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:32,759
real good buddies with a lot of those

1278
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:36,239
cats and I mean the whole time I was I

1279
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,400
was online I only I only traded Cuts uh

1280
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,039
through the mail maybe uh I only

1281
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,940
received cups through the mail twice I

1282
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,239
think

1283
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,280
um yeah like you know 40 50 plus you

1284
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:48,959
know uh packages of cuts but I only

1285
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,940
received twice I did all my other

1286
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,940
business just in person up and down the

1287
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:56,159
West Coast so that's me I'm very

1288
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,920
remember I'm in person

1289
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,500
do you remember uh Miss Elvis from the

1290
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,440
farm

1291
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:06,599
I wasn't very active on the farm at all

1292
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,920
very very little it was a person who

1293
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,140
showed like they were the main person

1294
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,280
showing the the Elvis cut back then

1295
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,719
there was something called like the pink

1296
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Cadillac cut and then there was the

1297
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,899
Elvis cut

1298
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,819
um that's that's the only person I ever

1299
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,400
got it from but I never

1300
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:21,900
they disappeared like not even a month

1301
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,160
after giving it to me but they were the

1302
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,680
ones that were always documenting it on

1303
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:28,739
the farm but I never knew if that was if

1304
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:30,058
it's just someone from that [ __ ] and

1305
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:32,959
made their way through because they

1306
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:32,960
disappeared so fast

1307
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,760
was it super incensey

1308
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,379
uh no it was exactly like what they

1309
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,440
talked about like a vinyl smell

1310
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:47,940
vinyl this artificial vinyl

1311
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,318
hmm yeah not infancy at all

1312
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,059
one of the things that's kind of

1313
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:53,159
interesting about that era too is it's

1314
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:55,800
kind of like the last era before like

1315
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:58,739
the the Clone name dominance thing

1316
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:01,140
started happening where everyone's

1317
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:03,358
growing OG or everyone's growing sour or

1318
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:05,699
everyone's growing all that kind of

1319
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,159
stuff so there was a lot of these odd

1320
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:09,239
strains you know not odd in the sense

1321
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,019
that there's anything wrong with them

1322
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:15,959
just odd odd random strains that were

1323
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:18,119
easily sold you know and so they they

1324
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,980
people liked them and they got traded

1325
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,780
yeah you know people weren't looking

1326
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,338
necessarily for like oh I need to get

1327
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,720
this specific cut because I'm going to

1328
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:26,940
be able to move it and it's going to go

1329
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,739
for X price you know they were more

1330
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,800
interested in like the legend or the

1331
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:34,078
history uh or whatever of said cut or

1332
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,700
the person behind it and you could get

1333
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,039
on there and start talking about your

1334
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:39,679
cut and all of a sudden drum up a bunch

1335
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:42,058
of Interest

1336
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:43,199
and especially like if we wanted to go

1337
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,280
back

1338
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,098
um you know when we were talking about

1339
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,619
how small it was I mean think about how

1340
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:51,420
revolutionary you know just some some of

1341
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:54,079
Matt's favorite some of blueberry stuff

1342
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:56,700
got you know and how it looked

1343
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,559
there wasn't that much competition there

1344
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:02,039
wasn't that much stuff outside of Europe

1345
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:04,200
or Shanti or Scentsy or you know uh

1346
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:06,058
Simon from Sirius or some of that stuff

1347
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,799
like there wasn't that many American

1348
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:11,460
breeders so the few people that were

1349
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,680
doing it like like Mr Soul or or DJ

1350
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,079
Short or whoever that we're willing to

1351
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,058
to show their work I think it kind of

1352
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,839
got like outsized

1353
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:23,940
you know outsized impact

1354
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:25,480
you know like Cindy 99 probably got way

1355
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,000
more famous than it should have

1356
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,858
[Laughter]

1357
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,358
you know just to be just to be just to

1358
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:35,219
be perfectly honest I don't think in

1359
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:38,400
today it would have the same lasting

1360
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:40,199
impact right no not today no it wouldn't

1361
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,300
it wouldn't have it wouldn't have been

1362
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:45,299
able to break through but it was like so

1363
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,680
I do think because it is is like when

1364
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,960
you try to think of an outdoor plant

1365
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:51,598
that's fast enough and still considered

1366
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,280
sativa to most people I think that it

1367
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,680
would be very hard to find a replacement

1368
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,900
for c99 that's at fast with those type

1369
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,719
of high qualities and I think that also

1370
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,639
had a major effect because it was it's a

1371
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,039
perfect outdoor plant for blasting fast

1372
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,558
you know and it could be grown indoors I

1373
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,119
just mean it got like all his work got

1374
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,339
real there wasn't that much competition

1375
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,920
so there wasn't a lot of time to talk

1376
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:15,960
about you know like not only Cindy 99

1377
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,720
but like we're like the genius or the

1378
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,940
Apollos or this or that or whatever or

1379
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:23,219
like you know everybody got plenty of

1380
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,139
time to debate the four or five things

1381
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:27,480
that DJ released

1382
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:29,879
yeah because there just wasn't that

1383
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,559
there wasn't that many different things

1384
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,900
you know there wasn't that many now

1385
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:36,720
there's there's thousands of breeders

1386
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,579
and so standing out is very hard then it

1387
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,139
was like you know what was what was

1388
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,760
there like you know a dozen big people

1389
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:43,920
doing stuff

1390
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,900
yeah it was a lot easier for people to

1391
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,700
[ __ ] keep other people down too like

1392
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,440
the ones at the top since there wasn't a

1393
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:51,239
lot of competition and they they held a

1394
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,159
lot of sway they could really cut

1395
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:54,779
[ __ ] throats real fast and it

1396
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:57,838
happened a lot too and it was a lot

1397
00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:00,119
easier to do that you know I would have

1398
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,980
probably got cut then if I had even

1399
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,619
tried to start back then

1400
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,000
dude I I like I said I was banned off

1401
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,500
every forum and it got to the point

1402
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,900
where I was like [ __ ] this let me start

1403
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,219
my own Forum like Mr Nice I I never got

1404
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,380
banned from

1405
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:15,358
um I got asked to leave after a picture

1406
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,220
contest because the the right Berry

1407
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:18,420
pictures beat out one of Mr nice's and

1408
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:19,919
he thought that was kind of [ __ ] of me

1409
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,079
to put it in

1410
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,539
um but yeah all the rest of them it was

1411
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,920
really hard because uh a lot of the ones

1412
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:28,318
a lot of people that were running those

1413
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,240
forums also had a seed company

1414
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,920
right and most of those seed banks and

1415
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,019
seed companies would eventually start

1416
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,579
[ __ ] people and if you were one of

1417
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:38,579
those people to speak up

1418
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:41,460
yeah you're done you know they don't

1419
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:44,700
want you around yeah I mean I I see mag

1420
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,159
definitely had some of that aspect to it

1421
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:51,239
too yeah there was The In Crowd in the

1422
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:52,558
outcrowd you know for sure as as far as

1423
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:54,598
that goes

1424
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,339
I'm I'm just surprised that forum is

1425
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,460
still alive after everything that went

1426
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:01,380
on with it yeah see people somebody

1427
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:04,440
talked about that people talk about 89

1428
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:07,140
Super Skunk there was an 89 Super Skunk

1429
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,780
one of one of the things that gets that

1430
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:11,159
that annoys the hell out of me uh

1431
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,440
honestly and this isn't to call out

1432
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,960
Whoever has 89 Super Skunk but just in

1433
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,780
general is like they'll take the first

1434
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,659
year that something was ever released or

1435
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,660
named and be like I have that weed from

1436
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:27,298
a year or two before then yeah that's a

1437
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:30,899
big problem like so the first time super

1438
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:33,900
skunk ever got used was in the 1990s

1439
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,400
seed bank catalog yeah that's when it

1440
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,338
had a picture and that's when it had a

1441
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,720
name that's when Neville released it

1442
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:41,099
you know

1443
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:43,379
um and so people were like oh I've got

1444
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:45,480
the 89 super skunk

1445
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,099
well how

1446
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,298
you know and then they're like oh you

1447
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,260
know then they got to come up with like

1448
00:56:48,298 --> 00:56:51,420
well you know it was all that

1449
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,400
pre-release special [ __ ] because I my my

1450
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,858
uncle was buddies with homie who gave it

1451
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,740
down on special kick down or they'll be

1452
00:56:55,858 --> 00:57:01,679
like you know you know I got that 95 93

1453
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:04,618
Scentsy star I actually have pictures of

1454
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:07,739
that 1989 Super Skunk and they look

1455
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:10,079
awful cookie-ish it's pretty pretty but

1456
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:11,939
you know it happens all the time and

1457
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,798
then you see a lot of these old Cuts

1458
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,900
right now the years keep getting earlier

1459
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:17,940
and earlier yeah

1460
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,680
you know I mean one thing and this isn't

1461
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,720
you know this isn't to you know

1462
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,159
obviously uh bodies use this or whatever

1463
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:26,699
else right

1464
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:28,318
but there is no G13 hash plant in the 88

1465
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:32,399
catalogs

1466
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:36,298
no no it came out in the 89 catalog

1467
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,500
for the first year 89 and 90.

1468
00:57:36,298 --> 00:57:41,519
you know but 88 is much better it sounds

1469
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,380
nice

1470
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,818
you know and I'm not trying to throw any

1471
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,079
shade on it or anything like that

1472
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:48,000
there's plenty of people that have found

1473
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,318
nice weed and you know buddy made a

1474
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,858
bunch of hybrids with it and it came

1475
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:54,900
from ndn guy I think right yeah yeah uh

1476
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:57,119
origin originally or whatever you know

1477
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,920
he reproduced it but it's like it got

1478
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,559
released in 89.

1479
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,900
right right but everyone calls it the

1480
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:06,599
great you know the 88

1481
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,280
right close enough you know all details

1482
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,440
like those that you know some of that

1483
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,700
first piff some of that first stuff they

1484
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,280
talk about

1485
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:16,919
um they'll call it the Great 88. yeah

1486
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,140
that [ __ ] got released in 89.

1487
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,639
so there's a bunch of stuff out there

1488
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:22,379
where people will be like this cut is

1489
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,539
from a year or two before this line ever

1490
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,358
got released here's a quick question

1491
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:30,358
though I mean I have zero experience in

1492
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:34,019
this uh because I was living in my you

1493
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:36,659
know whole and Humboldt but um

1494
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:38,759
uh you you were there so

1495
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:41,219
or maybe maybe you were there years

1496
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:45,599
later what was the possibility of them

1497
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:49,618
doing uh releases of their seeds

1498
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:53,460
um at the canvas cups

1499
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:55,200
um absolutely so that is true it is

1500
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,599
possible like for instance the first

1501
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,358
Cannabis Cup I went to the was the Jack

1502
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:03,180
Herrera cup uh and the whole thing was

1503
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:05,279
themed on him right right and it was all

1504
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:07,078
about like it was the whole like all the

1505
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,640
festivities were all about the emperor

1506
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:13,260
wears no clothes

1507
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:17,779
and they released Jack Herrera seeds

1508
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:21,240
um you know from uh uh in 95

1509
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:24,780
94. yeah 95. they released them but they

1510
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:26,159
it was you know it was late November

1511
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,019
right

1512
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,239
um but it wasn't in the catalog till the

1513
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:33,298
following year

1514
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:36,000
right so it was like literally it was

1515
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:38,579
literally the first time for instance uh

1516
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,019
Jack was dropped was at the camp was at

1517
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:42,839
the Cannabis Cup

1518
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:45,000
right in late November so I suppose you

1519
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:47,460
could have gotten it Jack Herrera at

1520
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,400
least six weeks before the year turned

1521
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,019
right right you know

1522
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,838
I mean uh

1523
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:57,780
for example Salmon Creek big bud

1524
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,639
um you know uh you know homeboy homeboy

1525
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,339
from Salmon Creek you know he bought

1526
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:04,858
those seeds at the cup the year it won

1527
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:07,039
the cup and then smuggled 50 of those

1528
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:09,619
seats home in his little belt you know

1529
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:12,838
Hideaway belt thing

1530
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:15,480
and that's you know his selection from

1531
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:18,599
those uh Scentsy big bud seeds or

1532
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,519
whatever is what made Salmon Creek big

1533
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,960
bud

1534
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:24,119
I mean that's that's definitely possible

1535
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,659
a lot of times

1536
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:30,660
um a lot of new seed releases would get

1537
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:32,338
dumped in late November then because

1538
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:35,039
because it was like an industry

1539
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:36,960
Gathering right right and there was tons

1540
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:37,920
of and honestly there was tons of custis

1541
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,519
there

1542
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:43,318
I ended up hating going to Amsterdam for

1543
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:44,539
the Cannabis Cup I went three times and

1544
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:47,039
then never again

1545
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:51,179
mostly because it sucked

1546
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,519
uh and the reason it sucked was that uh

1547
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:56,460
Amsterdam is pretty far north

1548
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,440
and so it's cold as [ __ ] in late

1549
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,940
November there right so you can go in

1550
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,440
summer and it's nice and it's beautiful

1551
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,838
and you're on a bicycle and you're

1552
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,639
cruising around all stoned or you can go

1553
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:11,219
when it's sleeting and 29 degrees

1554
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:13,798
and that's not as nice you know and then

1555
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:16,199
all the best weed would get saved for

1556
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:18,659
celebrities that were coming in and

1557
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:21,058
who's who so there was worse weed to get

1558
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:23,338
because it was all getting saved for you

1559
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:25,140
know Snoop Dogg or you know Sam skunk

1560
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:27,599
man's friends or you know whoever

1561
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:30,719
whoever the High Times crew or whatnot

1562
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,760
and then on top of that

1563
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,919
you could buy tickets to go to the

1564
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,099
Cannabis Cup out of High Times

1565
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,318
right so you go to Europe on vacation

1566
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:42,720
and the coffee shops are full with all

1567
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:45,058
these dudes from Jersey and New York

1568
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,818
yeah screaming about wanting to get the

1569
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:50,460
best bud in the world so it's like you

1570
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:51,960
you fly 12 hours away from your house

1571
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:54,599
and you're surrounded by a bunch of

1572
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,400
obnoxious East Coasters and there's not

1573
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,140
as good weed and it's crowded and it's

1574
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,298
cold and it's raining or it's snowing

1575
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:02,480
and it's like I much prefer going there

1576
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:04,980
in summer

1577
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,940
you know just because it was nice and

1578
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,679
chill

1579
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,139
you know but it was like an event that

1580
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,179

1586

didn't think it was done but they wanted

1587
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:28,259

being shared that seemed Cutting Edge at

1616
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:48,358
the time

1617
01:03:45,858 --> 01:03:51,779

as good as an S1 that's a clone man and

1621
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,280
I saw and I saw somebody talking about I

1622
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:00,960
like the super silver haze better than

1623
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,819
the Jack Herer

1624
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,858
um the whole reason Super Silver Haze

1625
01:04:02,818 --> 01:04:06,779
exists is because

1626
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:08,880
um Neville didn't feel like the Jack

1627
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,700
Herer project was ready for prime time

1628
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,200
he just released it due to you know Alan

1629
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:16,318
and Ben dronkers from Scentsy we're

1630
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,719
businessmen and so when he left he kept

1631
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,338
working on it

1632
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:23,699
and then a couple years later I think in

1633
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:25,739
97 or something he they released mango

1634
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:27,899
and Neville and Super Silver Haze

1635
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:29,519
because he felt like you know they'd

1636
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,798
actually gotten somewhere

1637
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,298
right right right but they still did a

1638
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:34,980
couple and I actually think that was the

1639
01:04:33,298 --> 01:04:37,019
last big release that Neville ever did

1640
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:40,440
right

1641
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:43,920
um but I mean I smoked that that super

1642
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,539
silver haze cut because two I went in 90

1643
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,900
I was basically like every other year

1644
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:51,299
like I went 97 and 99 too to the cups

1645
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,980
and those last two cups that super

1646
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:55,318
silver haze was all over the place

1647
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:58,318
because that was that was in that was

1648
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:01,679
like the first and third year at one

1649
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:04,199
it was like the hot [ __ ] over there

1650
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,940
right right it really was it was the hot

1651
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,759
[ __ ] I mean it was super there was afino

1652
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:11,338
of it that went like 14 weeks

1653
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:15,240
uh will the community let res back into

1654
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:17,400
play uh Rez is doing his own thing you

1655
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:20,038
know uh what most people don't know

1656
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,500
about res and are are a couple of

1657
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:24,839
buddies remind reminded me of not that

1658
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,699
long ago was like before all the

1659
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:28,619
[ __ ] with the with the law

1660
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:31,618
enforcement and all that

1661
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:35,280
um he was a dick online anyway

1662
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:38,280
right big time he was a big time troll

1663
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,798
jerk generally a pain in the ass to get

1664
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,619
along with not a pleasant homie

1665
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,880
yeah despite despite any of the rest of

1666
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:47,160
the bowl whatever you want to believe

1667
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,298
about you know all the mess that

1668
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:53,420
happened legally or whatever uh he was a

1669
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:58,259
he was an early troll

1670
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:02,039
he was a jackass he had a huge ego

1671
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:04,500
I mean he still does he he had a decent

1672
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:06,720
level of intelligence which would have

1673
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,699
been I think much more appreciated if he

1674
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,980
hadn't had so much ego with it yeah a

1675
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:12,838
little humid you know I mean not you

1676
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,159
know a bunch of ego and a bunch of

1677
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:16,318
rudeness

1678
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:17,818
mm-hmm you know there was some root

1679
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:19,858
there was some rude people you could put

1680
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:21,960
up with a little bit better but they

1681
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:24,900
were like borderline geniuses

1682
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,639
right right right you know like Tom Hill

1683
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,039
could be a real dick if you asked a dumb

1684
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,659
question

1685
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:33,359
I would know anything about ass being

1686
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,219
rude that's yeah I put up with it you

1687
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:36,900

1688
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:39,419
dick too because you know you get tired

1689
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,940
of I've told the same story five billion

1690
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,019
times right right you're gonna question

1691
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,358
me

1692
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:47,940
you're 23 shut the [ __ ] up you're a

1693
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,440
[ __ ] you know yeah eat my dick you

1694
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:53,099
know basically

1695
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,500
yeah rude kind of rude you know but it's

1696
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:57,599
hard it's hard to have patience

1697
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,159
you know and let's face it right a lot

1698
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,838
of us are weirdos

1699
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:03,739
a lot of us don't have the greatest

1700
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:07,920
interpersonal skills to begin with

1701
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:09,719
you know yourself but it really is I

1702
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,639
mean speaking for me I probably have a

1703
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:15,598
little bit more than your average grower

1704
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:17,400
just a bit yeah you know but a lot but a

1705
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,220
lot of them it's like you know we're

1706
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,260
kind of harsh edges people that live in

1707
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:24,480
the Hills don't talk to people hang out

1708
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,799
with plants and they're really good with

1709
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,240
plants and they're not so good with

1710
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:29,940
social interaction

1711
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:32,519
right right so you put those people on

1712
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,679
the forums and you put those people like

1713
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:36,538
you know on IG or whatever and it's like

1714
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:39,419
it's not the easiest thing

1715
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:41,640
I did have an adjustment period that uh

1716
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,260
I will admit I had an adjustment period

1717
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,900
of where

1718
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:47,940
I may have been a little meaner uh in

1719
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,000
responses and talking to people a little

1720
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:53,579
Snappy maybe a little bit of ego

1721
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,780
you know it happens but some of us grow

1722
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:59,400
into beautiful smiling faces like this

1723
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:02,579
well I'm also still banned from breed

1724
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,920
Bay for uh picking on sub cool it's also

1725
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:06,240
it's also the way I look at it is like

1726
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,880
you know I mean everybody has the

1727
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,139
natural inclination sometimes but it's

1728
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,700
like are you trying to get your point

1729
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:12,779
across are you trying to [ __ ] argue

1730
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:14,879
on the internet

1731
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:17,279
right oh here's this dude who says his

1732
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,319
dad created dog bud I remember that guy

1733
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,120
he's trying to dox me I think I'm gonna

1734
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,859
block him okay there you go I mean the

1735
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,960
thing the thing about the one thing

1736
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:28,798
we'll say about dog bud and then we'll

1737
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,198
move on is that Joe brand and Peabody

1738
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:34,259
were buying and selling weed on dead

1739
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:36,899
Tour all the time for cash to go see

1740
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:40,020
Dead shows right and this one weekend

1741
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:41,579
they sold some weed and then they mailed

1742
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:44,219
Greg some more weed

1743
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:46,859
and then 15 years went by before they

1744
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,719
even heard anything cool came out of it

1745
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:51,779
uh-huh

1746
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:54,719
right they literally they they never saw

1747
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:57,839
chem 91 or anything like that until 0-6

1748
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:01,140
until the reunion when the forums got

1749
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:03,778
people back together they had no idea

1750
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:05,940
they're on dead tour right they met this

1751
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:08,520
you know you know these guys

1752
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:10,979
uh Greg was in it was a teenager from

1753
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,219
the east coast and they sold him some

1754
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:16,079
weed in Indiana

1755
01:09:13,219 --> 01:09:16,980
right which was just one stop on summer

1756
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,838
tour

1757
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:20,818
and you're buying pounds and you're

1758
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:22,500
selling eights and quarters and halfs

1759
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:23,819
and ounces and it ran out and you buy

1760
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,439
some other pounds and you just keep

1761
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:27,659
doing that and you did that for a while

1762
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,000
and one of these sales turned into

1763
01:09:27,658 --> 01:09:32,399
something

1764
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,539
and now you want to hey 15 years ago do

1765
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:38,460
you remember uh it was summer uh on dead

1766
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:40,259
tour do you remember this one couple

1767
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,179
pounds you had that you were hustling

1768
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,219
for like a weekend

1769
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,079
do you have any clear memory of that

1770
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:49,319
because it's kind of important

1771
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:52,738
well I think uh I think he might have uh

1772
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:57,179
remembered just because he

1773
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:59,399
um hit Joe brand up you know gee hit Joe

1774
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:02,460
brand up again and had him mail him some

1775
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:04,679
more weed I think right two ounces and

1776
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,539
we don't even know if the seeds came

1777
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,880
from the Deer Creek show

1778
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:10,319
or the seeds came from the weed that Joe

1779
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,440
sent him later

1780
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:16,859
it's I from based on the stories I've

1781
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:19,919
kind of deciphered I I think it it came

1782
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:22,679
from the ones that was sent that one had

1783
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,199
no seeds but then again we know geez

1784
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:27,300
stories are a little up and down I mean

1785
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:29,099
you know not to I like two of my

1786
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:33,179
favorite cuts of all time coming out of

1787
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:35,400
geez little rooms but I will say that

1788
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:37,920
um all of us on this thing have tried to

1789
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:40,319
uh have tried to interpret what he meant

1790
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,340
by rejuvenating the 91 after it got

1791
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:46,559
tired in 94.

1792
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:48,420
them rejuvenate yeah the the

1793
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,719
Rejuvenation he had to let it go and

1794
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:54,619
rejuvenate it that's how you fix it from

1795
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:56,399
seed and that [ __ ] never got explained

1796
01:10:54,619 --> 01:10:58,140
you know

1797
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,238
um and so I don't I you know there's

1798
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:02,460
when it when any time you have a

1799
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:05,218
situation where you know we can even go

1800
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:07,619
back and take you know like ancient you

1801
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:11,939
know ancient Virginia skunk bud grown

1802
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:14,939
for sssc or Mr Soul you know working for

1803
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:16,859
sssc you know you you create these

1804
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:20,039
ancient legends and it's like how do you

1805
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:21,420
disprove them yeah in a lot of cases you

1806
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:22,380
can't prove or disprove because they're

1807
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,000
so old

1808
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:26,219
well let's get back to the forums I got

1809
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,198
a question yeah yeah

1810
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:29,880
um what was the first place do you

1811
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:31,198
remember where the first like seed bake

1812
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,579
the first seed bank that carried your

1813
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:34,619
[ __ ] when people could actually buy it

1814
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:38,100
which one was it

1815
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:40,579
well we don't talk about that okay so

1816
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:44,840
it's an unmentionable

1817
01:11:40,579 --> 01:11:44,840
I ain't friends with that guy anymore

1818
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:51,599
my fault that dude a little Loco yeah oh

1819
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:54,178
okay gotcha

1820
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,539
you gotta remember I didn't even uh

1821
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:58,859
start my seed company until 2014. yeah

1822
01:11:57,539 --> 01:12:02,698
yeah I remember

1823
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:04,799
yeah I I made I could say one thing is

1824
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:06,419
that my buddy that I never mentioned his

1825
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,699
name but Staten Island when we were

1826
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,380
doing all the super dog work and we were

1827
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:14,339
doing all those hybrids that made it

1828
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:16,980
into the Cana Bible he had Big Dreams of

1829
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,920
realizing that you could probably make

1830
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:22,079
more money like off of an eight lighter

1831
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,760
of seed than you could off an eight

1832
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,460
light or a flower

1833
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,140
and he saw what was coming I honestly

1834
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:30,060
didn't believe him

1835
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,500
you know I didn't think I didn't think

1836
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:34,219
that we you would ever be able in

1837
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,359
America to like package up and sell

1838
01:12:34,219 --> 01:12:38,579
enormous amounts of seed or anything

1839
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:40,019
like that because at the time we were

1840
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:41,640
making all this stuff and we were

1841
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,739
literally giving it away to good friends

1842
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,300
and stuff because we had more than we

1843
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:47,399
knew what to do with and there wasn't an

1844
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:50,340
outlet for it

1845
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:52,500
um you know the era that that Caleb

1846
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,420
talks about getting involved is one of

1847
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:57,238
the earlier eras where you could really

1848
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:59,579
actually start to sell it

1849
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,738
it wasn't simple in the beginning even

1850
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:03,840
even if you were an active breeder

1851
01:13:01,738 --> 01:13:05,819
finding out how to get it to the

1852
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,239
community wasn't very simple

1853
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:11,579
no at all you had to trust I mean like

1854
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:14,399
even even with me I started the um

1855
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:17,158
selling seats directly really early for

1856
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,839
for a U.S person

1857
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:21,179
um but when I first started you still

1858
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,739
had to really put your trust in someone

1859
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:24,480
in Europe for the most part if you

1860
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:26,339
wanted any kind of traction for your

1861
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,259
seeds if you wanted any

1862
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:30,239
I mean you had to work with seed banks

1863
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,800
for people they'd eventually know who

1864
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,299
you are if the seed bank didn't care you

1865
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,860
you probably weren't [ __ ] important

1866
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:39,500
and that's where everybody looked at it

1867
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:39,500
we were about to go into CSI after dark

1868
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,840
yeah

1869
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,179
but yeah I mean uh you know a good bit

1870
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,579
of that was in the 90s

1871
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:53,219
you know when DJ Short wanted to get his

1872
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:54,300
blueberry seed out there he had to give

1873
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:57,899
it away

1874
01:13:54,300 --> 01:14:00,239
to uh two different groups in Europe

1875
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:01,920
yeah first he had to give it to Tony at

1876
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:03,658
sag Martha and then he had to give it to

1877
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,100
Dutch Passion I don't know if he

1878
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:07,139
intentionally gave it away but I think

1879
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:10,520
that's how it ended up working out I

1880
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:13,079
think he did huh didn't didn't he

1881
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,960
purposely give them to him and maybe he

1882
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:18,479
purposely did I think he thought that he

1883
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,619
would still retain all control and this

1884
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,259
and that that's where he was probably

1885
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:25,260
mistaken but in order for him to even

1886
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:28,800
like get money for his seeds he had to

1887
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:31,920
send them to an established seed bank

1888
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:34,020
yeah in a different continent

1889
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,679
that's how hard it was to move seeds

1890
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,900
then

1891
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,880
yeah but you know when he I think sag

1892
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:40,920
Martha they had his seeds in what like

1893
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,760
you know the mid 90s or something like

1894
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,600
that

1895
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,060
um

1896
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,400
uh right around there yeah the internet

1897
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,900
didn't even exist then really

1898
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:50,839
right right

1899
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:52,920
I did but uh

1900
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:56,460
level that you were going to be able to

1901
01:14:52,920 --> 01:15:01,158
use it for that yeah yeah I think

1902
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:01,158
overgrowth started in either 98 or 99

1903
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:08,760
so like the first forums the first being

1904
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:11,159
able to exchange stuff like how would DJ

1905
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:14,219
have even set up an internet was going

1906
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:18,000
to set up a geocities like [ __ ] you

1907
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:19,560
know web page and sell illegal beans

1908
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,198
you know

1909
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:26,460
um I mean up until up until they passed

1910
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:29,039
the the 215 in in late 96 I think it was

1911
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:31,140
it was it was illegal in all 50 states

1912
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,760
there wasn't any there wasn't even a

1913
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,440
legitimate reason you could possess any

1914
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,840
of it yeah

1915
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:38,819
and I think he feels burnt he felt

1916
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,980
burned but you know what were you going

1917
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:42,899
to do when you gave it away to the Dutch

1918
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:44,218
right if he didn't know that those those

1919
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:45,779
Dutch guys were going to do whatever the

1920
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:48,480
[ __ ] they wanted with it then he was

1921
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:50,158
just he had just done his groundwork

1922
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:54,000
yeah

1923
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:58,198
well yeah that that's a blueberry is

1924
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,359
almost a a a a full day's topic just by

1925
01:15:58,198 --> 01:16:02,039
itself it is but I just met in the sense

1926
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:04,198
that like just to use it on the example

1927
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:06,779
of how hard it was to sell seeds if you

1928
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:08,819
were a small American breeder yeah he

1929
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:11,579
had to work with the Dutch just to get

1930
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:12,779
it out there there wasn't an Avenue what

1931
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:15,000
were you gonna do

1932
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:17,279
I mean you know

1933
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,319
um you know even like early even early

1934
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,420
American you know seed sellers or

1935
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:23,399
whatever used to try to fake that their

1936
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:26,060
stuff was based out of Europe

1937
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:26,059
right right

1938
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:32,159
you know I I mean one of the things that

1939
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:33,959
IG did and and the middle and and the

1940
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:36,779
sort of the middle era of two middle

1941
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,000
late 215 was things opened up enough

1942
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:41,819
that people felt free

1943
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,260
to be able to like you know you could

1944
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:45,539
have a swamp boys

1945
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,159
you could have a CSI humble you could

1946
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:48,359
have a you could have just these people

1947
01:16:47,158 --> 01:16:50,579

um I can say back in

1953
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:04,738
02030405 I mean my buddy from Staten

1954
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,179
Island would tell me about this stuff

1955
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:07,439
that he wanted to do and I would laugh

1956
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:09,658
at him

1957
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:11,599
I was like oh you want us to all go to

1958
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,500
jail

1959
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,500
that's what it seems like you're talking

1960
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:18,238
about to me you know yeah when I started

1961
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,219
I I was one of the P I think I was one

1962
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,139
of the few people that pretended that my

1963
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:25,140
website was in Amsterdam just to like

1964
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:26,760
try to hide under the shadows you know

1965
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:30,239
just because no one was doing it it's it

1966
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,980
[ __ ] was a big red flag I'm just

1967
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:33,959
waiting for that hit even having the

1968
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:37,619
infrastructure set up to be successful

1969
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:40,260
yeah and and that's kind of why there

1970
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:42,840
was so few breeders back then

1971
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,860
because it was generally done out of

1972
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,539
love

1973
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:47,939
and you were trading amongst other

1974
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:49,439
people and there wasn't something like

1975
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:51,839
there is now where somebody can be like

1976
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,519
Oh I'm gonna drop my Mac one drop and

1977
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,039
I'm gonna make 200 Grand and you know

1978
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,199
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hype it

1979
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:59,819
yeah you really couldn't hype it there

1980
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:03,419
wasn't marketing there wasn't an ability

1981
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:04,738
to reach a big audience right right I

1982
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:07,739
don't think

1983
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:12,178
you know no it took a while

1984
01:18:07,738 --> 01:18:16,319
and uh in in in the era you know 06 you

1985
01:18:12,179 --> 01:18:18,000
know through 08 even 2010 I mean most of

1986
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,698
the marketing most most of the

1987
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,079
availability was all based on internet

1988
01:18:20,698 --> 01:18:27,419
forums right yeah you know that was yeah

1989
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:29,399
and people should also remember that

1990
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:31,920
when overgrown cannabis World got shut

1991
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:35,359
down they got shut down because of very

1992
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,399
big uh you know seed vendor got raided

1993
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:40,859
uh Heaven's stairway

1994
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,319
that was and that scared a bunch of

1995
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:44,579
people

1996
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:46,439
and there's still repercussions and

1997
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:49,859
ripples hidden from that [ __ ] bust

1998
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:51,899
you know and you know and then you know

1999
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:53,399

01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:00,679
[ __ ] he went to jail

2003
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:08,698
did you have any dealings with Mark

2004
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,699
gamer Caleb interactions

2005
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:14,939

2006
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:18,000
um you know I was I was getting uh

2007
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:20,460
cannabis culture or cannabis Canada from

2008
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,100
pretty much like the first issue you

2009
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:25,020
know I've always been a historian so I

2010

magazine that was put out on on

2014
01:19:30,658 --> 01:19:36,839
everything so I've always been way more

2015
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:39,300
of a reader than a talker yeah you know

2016
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,579
it helps put details together sometimes

2017
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:44,880
yeah it does yeah

2018
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:48,359
but no no no uh direct you know dealings

2019
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,760
I mean uh the stuff I liked from from

2020
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:53,939
those magazines though and and him were

2021
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:56,760
like the ABC stuff from back yeah late

2022
01:19:53,939 --> 01:19:59,399
90s and then the purple Indica Purple

2023
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:03,420
Kush stuff that was in those early

2024
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:04,679
issues as well but uh and then Emery was

2025
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:06,420
working with the same purple Indica

2026
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:09,060
that's around now or at least a relative

2027
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:11,520
uh it wasn't Emery uh there was an

2028
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:15,600
article uh based out of Snohomish County

2029
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,540
yeah okay in Washington and it it

2030
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,420
basically dated that that stuff back

2031
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:25,619
into the you know at the very least you

2032
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:27,300
know early mid 90s yeah that's cool so

2033
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:28,559
there was a question we were talking

2034
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,940
about the other night and I was like oh

2035
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,860
I need to ask not so that and I can't

2036
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:33,238
remember what it was it had something to

2037
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:34,738
do with uh

2038
01:20:33,238 --> 01:20:37,799

2040
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:43,320
yeah who brought it oh that's that's

2041
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:46,739
pretty simple story so it ties into the

2042
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:50,759
forums so people start in 06 people

2043
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:52,678
started getting excited about uh chemdog

2044
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,920
and the chem dog story because it

2045
01:20:52,679 --> 01:21:01,260
started getting posted uh like

2046
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:02,819
um uh Caleb was saying Shabba had got uh

2047
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:06,420

2050
01:21:07,859 --> 01:21:13,198
stuff like that and and then you know

2051
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,820
that's kind of actually what started to

2052
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,059
reunite

2053
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:21,719

01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:24,239
and uh chem dog all they all started

2055
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:26,279
chatting I believe they even called like

2056
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:29,579
the the seeds that ended up being the

2057
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:32,759
one through four the reunion seeds or

2058
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:35,399

2059
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,380
Reunion Fino specific reunion Fino

2060
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:39,599
that's what it was right because it was

2061
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,760
like they had all they'd all kind of met

2062
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,020
up as this you know like different

2063
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,639
people were like hey dude they're

2064
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:47,639
talking about your story on the internet

2065
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:50,159
right and so

2066
01:21:47,639 --> 01:21:52,260
chem dog hadn't actually had the chem 91

2067
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:53,939
in quite a long time

2068
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,159
um he had gotten in trouble and lost it

2069
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:59,279
and he had been working with some of the

2070
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:00,779
uh chemdog Super Skunk hybrids that he

2071
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,179

2072
01:22:00,779 --> 01:22:05,759
and when it got famous again he wanted

2073
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:08,340
it back but nobody had it

2074
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:11,760
so he got

2075
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:13,619
um he got skunked he got skunk VA to go

2076
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,539
back East with it

2077
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:17,340
and he was like if you bring it back to

2078
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:18,719
bring it back to me and I've got this

2079
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:21,060
different one that you guys don't have

2080
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,439
out there and

2081
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,620
um I'll give it to you

2082
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:27,359
so he went back east and and saw a dude

2083
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:31,198
and gave him the and gave him the dog

2084
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:33,839
and then uh Greg gave him the D

2085
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:37,019
and he came back and mommed it up and

2086
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:39,420
that's how uh me and uh I see Collective

2087
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:43,460

2089
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:49,079
it was him it was it was all it's he's

2090
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,639
the reason it's he to me he's the reason

2091
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:53,219
it's on the West Coast

2092
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:56,279
very cool uh he put forth the effort he

2093
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:58,619
went back East to see chemdog uh he gave

2094
01:22:56,279 --> 01:23:00,319
he gave the dog to chem dog he got the

2095
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:03,359
dude

2096
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:06,119
if I remember too

2097
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,899
um uh I believe that

2098
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:09,658
um

2099
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:12,179
chem dog tried to give him back the MSS

2100
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:13,799
yeah he just said that but it was the

2101
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:16,560
shorter one that was in the high times

2102
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,719
and it wasn't what uh homie remembered

2103
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,300
it all that makes a lot of sense too

2104
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:24,119
yeah so then yeah so then he came back

2105
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,699
and he grew it up into a mom or whatever

2106
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:29,519
and then uh I see Collective and myself

2107
01:23:26,698 --> 01:23:30,960
got it not that long after that and but

2108
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,460
to me it's like the reason it's on the

2109
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:37,619
west coast is is skunk VA well on Greg

2110
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:38,460
uh on G's tour

2111
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:43,198
um

2112
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:46,739
he uh he he dropped it off uh in the you

2113
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:49,919
know LA area with swerve the chemd in 06

2114
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:51,959
but this is awesome he

2115
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,020
um and swerve traded him a bunch of fake

2116
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:59,158
cuts for it you know no big deal and

2117
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:02,520
then he also stopped at uh he stopped at

2118
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:04,439
um you know obsolete's in central cal

2119
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,199
um on his tour and then he stopped at

2120
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:09,059
Joe Brands and then he headed up into

2121
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:10,919
Oregon and stopped at some other folks

2122
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:14,100
place and I think he might have given

2123
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,560
them the chemd too but he he stopped a a

2124
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:19,139
good handful of places giving cuts out

2125
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,719
selling weed at dispensaries all that

2126
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:24,779
kind of stuff on his you know reunion

2127
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:28,920
tour of sorts and this was like first

2128
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:31,099
week of August 06. so it sounds like uh

2129
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:35,179
skunk VA went over there

2130
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:38,820
earlier in the year and and and got

2131
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:40,920
the same or similar cut I don't know

2132
01:24:38,819 --> 01:24:43,920
seems like there was a few cuts that got

2133
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:46,739
passed out that year yeah

2134
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,960
yeah I mean it so but that's that's kind

2135
01:24:46,738 --> 01:24:50,759
of that's how that's how the the and

2136
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,859
that led to a bunch of stuff that led to

2137
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,659
the one two three four

2138
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:57,198
getting popped and starting to get

2139
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:57,198
traded around

2140
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,380
um that led to the D that that led to

2141
01:24:59,698 --> 01:25:03,000
the one through the four and the D and

2142
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:04,560
all that starting to get added to the

2143
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,600
mix

2144
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,719
um I don't know that the weird thing

2145
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:13,199
about the the chem stuff is that my

2146
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:14,460
buddy disliked the CIS quite a bit he

2147
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:16,919
thought it was ugly and he didn't like

2148
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:18,179
how it got him high so he never brought

2149
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,699
it West

2150
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:23,219
and so it never really percolated around

2151
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:26,158
our crew

2152
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:28,619
um you know we way later we saw some of

2153
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,779
the s1s

2154
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:32,039
um but not the actual not the actual

2155
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:33,658
first one

2156
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:34,859
you know yeah

2157
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:37,319
so

2158
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:40,439
but yeah I mean that's and I you know

2159
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:42,960
I'm pretty sure uh you know he I I never

2160
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:44,519
I never lost it after skunk gave it to

2161
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,319
me

2162
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,780
um yeah I mean that and that's that's

2163
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:50,340
the kind of thing like you know uh CSI

2164
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:52,139
and I talk about it all the time it's

2165
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:54,420
like are there strains where like the

2166
01:25:52,139 --> 01:25:56,400
chain of custody wasn't broken

2167
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,158
mm-hmm

2168
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,198
right right because once you lose the

2169
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:03,738
chain of custody

2170
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:07,379
um you know it's hard

2171
01:26:03,738 --> 01:26:10,979
it gets hard you know like

2172
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:13,199
um because who knows you know you try to

2173
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:14,638
you I lost the sour diesel you try to

2174
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:16,500
get it back it's not the same thing you

2175
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:19,199
remember you lost this you try to get it

2176
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:21,840
back it's not the same you remember

2177
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:23,339
um you know so on and so forth so

2178
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:27,119
yeah

2179
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:29,520
kind of like when uh 707 uh Shabad got

2180
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,579
his Bubba back from me

2181
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,620
um I I I don't think I did it on purpose

2182
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:36,359
it was an accident it got mixed up in a

2183
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:39,658
flat because I was bringing a ton of

2184
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:43,019
people a bunch of stuff at a party and

2185
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:46,138
uh then like a year later he's like yeah

2186
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:48,900
in inspective Bubba and I was like

2187
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:52,039
what's this inspector's bow and he had

2188
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:54,960
bomb threat and not oh [ __ ]

2189
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:57,300
I was like oh my bad my bad I'm trying

2190
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,658
to give you you know the fake that's one

2191
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:02,659
well not fake but you know yeah but yeah

2192
01:27:00,658 --> 01:27:05,519
that happens all the time

2193
01:27:02,658 --> 01:27:09,960
I think I'd take uh bomb threat over

2194
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:11,820
over original maybe you can always get a

2195
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,698
new bomb threat if you have that that's

2196
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:15,359
true that's true that's a good point you

2197
01:27:14,698 --> 01:27:17,939
know

2198
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,319
just a question for you since uh we've

2199
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:22,319
kind of meandered away from the Forum

2200
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:23,579
stuff but do you CSI do you do any work

2201
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:24,479
with Jesus are you planning any work

2202
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:27,479
with it

2203
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:27,479
uh

2204
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:34,619
maybe if I could find a math Super Skunk

2205
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:37,460
yeah yeah that was for YouTube really

2206
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:37,460
yeah

2207
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:42,899
I was telling him it's night that I

2208
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:44,760
think he should because I think it's a

2209
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:47,219
it's a rad clone but it is it is very

2210
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,079
finicky and it does make it a lot harder

2211
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:51,658
to to pull off reversals on unhappy

2212
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:53,399
finicky [ __ ] right it would it would be

2213
01:27:51,658 --> 01:27:57,238
really cool to kind of

2214
01:27:53,399 --> 01:28:00,719
uh attempt to remake like

2215
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:03,479
um a sour type from you know building

2216
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:06,600
blocks I mean yeah you know we all have

2217
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:08,879
the the 91 but you know what building

2218
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:11,100
blocks you know it might not have to be

2219
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,460
the exact thing but what could you get

2220
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:16,500
close enough to to make a sour diesel

2221
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:19,500
out of you know the original building

2222
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:22,500
blocks yeah you know

2223
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:24,179
I think jesel leans closer to a sour

2224
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,779
type than it does at chem type

2225
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,779
personally

2226
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:33,238
oh yeah definitely definitely yeah I

2227
01:28:29,219 --> 01:28:34,319
think so it's a cool one yeah yeah all

2228
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:35,939
right so people want to hear something

2229
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,319
about Irene I don't know what they want

2230
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:39,359
to hear about Irene I think we've

2231
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:41,880
already told the story of Irene but do

2232
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:45,299
you have any good Irene Tales

2233
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,800
oh I don't know I mean

2234
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,900
she's cool

2235
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,539
I think

2236
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:54,238
um I I had Irene for a little bit

2237
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:56,880
um and didn't realize she was she was

2238
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:59,779
you know as as nice as she was until I

2239
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:03,119
think I grew her Outdoors uh in maybe

2240
01:28:59,779 --> 01:29:04,619
2008 I'm thinking

2241
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:06,420
yeah

2242
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:07,559
I don't want to fudge the fudge the

2243
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,960
dates though

2244
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,060
um but yeah she came out so nice back

2245
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,340
then you know

2246
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:18,679
good old-fashioned Atlanta

2247
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:22,319
's finest yeah it is a special one yeah

2248
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:25,079
I mean it doesn't have a whole whole lot

2249
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:27,059
of a story you know yeah just another

2250
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:28,738
another backseat really

2251
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:31,199
that's where the golf ball is down to

2252
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:33,000
it's just another [ __ ] bad seat I

2253
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:34,859
mean that is one of the most humbling

2254
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,679
things about breeding

2255
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:40,399
is that a lot of the most famous strains

2256
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,480
are total accidents

2257
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,819
right and then you put a bunch of time

2258
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,319
and work and effort into stuff and then

2259
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:48,359
you know your air conditioner goes out

2260
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:50,279
and some [ __ ] Herms and the seed off of

2261
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:53,819
that is better than anything you tried

2262
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:56,639
to do and I think a lot of times when it

2263
01:29:53,819 --> 01:29:59,039
comes to like these stories the The

2264
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:01,260
Accidental weed is so good it's what

2265
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,319
makes people want to try to like shoe

2266
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:06,179
horn in that they had some intentional

2267
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:08,698
part of making it

2268
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:10,079
not so much that I was just there or we

2269
01:30:08,698 --> 01:30:12,138
got late they don't want to say well I

2270
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:14,460
just got lucky in my room

2271
01:30:12,139 --> 01:30:16,079
they want to be like oh well I did this

2272
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,639
and I did this and I did this and then

2273
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,039
that happened and yeah now it's all the

2274
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:22,199
weed that you all love Well everybody's

2275
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:24,779
got to work their stud isn't that how

2276
01:30:22,198 --> 01:30:28,079
it's done you know but but really it was

2277
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:30,238
more like you know I was I had my room I

2278
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:32,460
ended up partying for a few days I

2279
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:35,819
[ __ ] off I walked in there there was

2280
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:40,439
some bananas I found some seeds trimming

2281
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:43,979
that's like 99 of bag seed stories yeah

2282
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:46,678
that that's kind of why I believe uh uh

2283
01:30:43,979 --> 01:30:49,439
Matt Berger and Josh D story because

2284
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:52,619
it's not impressive it's not a you know

2285
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:54,779
it's a Herm you know in a little closet

2286
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:57,000
under the stairs story and it's just

2287
01:30:54,779 --> 01:30:57,779
like who makes that stuff up that's not

2288
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,619
right

2289
01:30:57,779 --> 01:31:04,800
that's just oops Yeah I mean you know I

2290
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:07,319
it it that's very humbling but I I also

2291
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,760
do think that a lot of that 90s weed it

2292
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:11,819
just goes to show that when you're

2293
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,679
Crossing things that like aren't when

2294
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:15,299
you're Crossing real fire

2295
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,760
you know

2296
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:19,800
um it's a lot easier to get you know

2297
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,360
like was was Neville an amazing breeder

2298
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,159
or did he just get to get the best of

2299
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:24,719
the best from America and cross it

2300
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:26,939
together for the first time

2301
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,960
right right you know what I'm saying

2302
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,519
there's a there's an app there's

2303
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:31,560
arguments to both

2304
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,420
you know he was the first person to

2305
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:36,000
cross NL and skunk

2306
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:37,158
right you know

2307
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,460
huh

2308
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:44,339
what do you saying I'm rude no uh no uh

2309
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:48,000
I was thinking you should get uh Tom on

2310
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:51,119
and try to get uh uh figure out a little

2311
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,639
more details about pine tar and all that

2312
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:56,099
kind of stuff because I'd love to

2313
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:58,920
you know I don't think he even knows who

2314
01:31:56,100 --> 01:32:01,320
I am to get him on

2315
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:04,260
or he's not likely

2316
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:06,599
I I think he's banned off I see mag so

2317
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:08,699
uh yeah I mean let me ask you like a

2318
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,679
real question do you think that he would

2319
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:13,919
be better for a live or do you think he

2320
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:17,940
would be better for a a lightly edited

2321
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:20,880
uh podcast or something oh probably a a

2322
01:32:17,939 --> 01:32:22,379
heavily edited podcast because I mean we

2323
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,000
definitely Matt and I have definitely

2324
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:27,659
interviewed some like knowledgeable

2325
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,319
Old-Timers right then like

2326
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:33,059
yeah

2327
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:36,439
Tom's a character I like him but man

2328
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,440
he'll yeah

2329
01:32:36,679 --> 01:32:41,940
off topic

2330
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,159
yeah you know yeah so there's there is a

2331
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:45,299
question everybody is asking and it's up

2332
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:46,259
to you if you want to talk about I don't

2333
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:48,000
even know if you want to deal with this

2334
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:50,400
one right now or save it for a full

2335
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,760
episode Caleb

2336
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:56,099
backstory on Z what do you think

2337
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,320
oh man

2338
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:01,560
um I don't want to like

2339
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:02,939
say saying yet because yeah let's say

2340
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,000
you want to save it for a full show of

2341
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:07,738
some sort later well I I still have some

2342
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,719
groans to do on that whole thing but

2343
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:12,718
yeah man

2344
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:16,920
I I wouldn't be surprised if it's not

2345
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:18,539
just an S1 of of uh that green Sherbert

2346
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,060
cut yeah

2347
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:22,380
um there's there's just two too many

2348
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:26,520
similarities

2349
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:28,760
and the whole you know uh heterozygous

2350
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:31,920
homozygous thing between the two of them

2351
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:36,179
really kind of leans towards it just

2352
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:38,100
being a that's one of that yeah but I

2353
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:41,880
don't know um

2354
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:44,820
uh I yeah I could go on and on on some

2355
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:46,380
comparisons on you know how some of that

2356
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:49,139
stuff could uh

2357
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:51,960
could potentially make sense

2358
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:53,400
um yeah but I don't know I don't know

2359
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,560
yeah we'll save it for another time but

2360
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:57,420
yeah that's a that's a good answer one

2361
01:33:55,560 --> 01:34:00,120
thing one thing that is done

2362
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:03,119
about that is that

2363
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:04,738
um uh CSI and I and Matt we all talk all

2364
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:08,039
the time about how when you compare

2365
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:11,579
stories to what the plants tell you

2366
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:12,719
uh how they breed what their s1s look

2367
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:14,100
like

2368
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,859
um what what they look like when they

2369
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:19,199
get crossed to different things and how

2370
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:20,819
what your eyes tell you lines up with

2371
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:24,238
what the story is

2372
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:26,279
right right you know and sometimes it it

2373
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:28,678
sometimes it adds a lot

2374
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:30,658
in terms of what you see

2375
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:33,060
um you know like about I have a heart I

2376
01:34:30,658 --> 01:34:36,479
have a really hard time believing that

2377
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:38,100
the the the CIS the 91 the chemd and the

2378
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:39,119
one through four all came out of the

2379
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,880
same bud

2380
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:43,800
yeah yeah you know um they're just too

2381
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,960
vastly different to me

2382
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,860
um you know but that's I wasn't there

2383
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,600
either

2384
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:51,000
you know and a lot of this stuff is like

2385
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:54,000
the most famous stories

2386
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,039
they almost because almost all of them

2387
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,380
come from accidents and because a lot of

2388
01:34:56,039 --> 01:35:00,600
them come from other people it's like

2389
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:02,639
the people that marketed stuff or

2390
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,340
marketed Skittles or marketed cookie or

2391
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,900
whatever like they probably you know

2392
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:09,380
different people get it maybe it doesn't

2393
01:35:06,899 --> 01:35:11,339
get quite as famous

2394
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:12,600
you know

2395
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,159
um you know and they should get great

2396
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,239
credit for marketing it to the point

2397
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:18,738
that they did

2398
01:35:15,238 --> 01:35:18,738
yeah right oh yeah

2399
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:25,619
I've never disputed that um you know I I

2400
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,560
give lots of people accolades for Mar

2401
01:35:25,618 --> 01:35:30,599
successfully marketing and you know

2402
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,760
building you know clones that would

2403
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,199
never have been anything up you know to

2404
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:37,440
what they are

2405
01:35:34,198 --> 01:35:39,000
uh what I've always you know frowned on

2406
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:41,219
of course is you know people being

2407
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,579
dishonest doing it I think you can do it

2408
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:47,039
honestly and still be successful sure

2409
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:49,500
you know having to just make up big old

2410
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:52,019
big old you know fictitious backstories

2411
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:54,840
or yeah like you're the one responsible

2412
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:57,179
for it that's why instead of you know I

2413
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,159
mean there's cats like you know Josh and

2414
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:00,840
Matt who are like oh yeah it was a Herm

2415
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:02,698
accident under the stairs and then

2416
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,319
there's other cats you know who are like

2417
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:06,178
yes we created that from our

2418
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,779
multi-thousand plant grows aren't we

2419
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:13,560
awesome yes yes we popped we popped 15

2420
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:15,539
seeds and the 20th was the best so you

2421
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:19,380
know

2422
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:23,158
um you know I I think the the truth is

2423
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:25,020
is the the biggest factor for me yeah

2424
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:26,879
and yeah and there's an aspect where and

2425
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:29,940
and you know we should say this too is

2426
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,159
that truth is a most people Everyone

2427
01:36:29,939 --> 01:36:33,599
likes to say they want the truth but

2428
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,000
like people that really care about it

2429
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:39,539
it's like a really small percentage yeah

2430
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,219
oh most people like truth if it helps

2431
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:44,460
them burnish their money or their

2432
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:47,100
reputation or whatever else sure and the

2433
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:48,779
truth is usually boring you know people

2434
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,639
who are looking for excitement from the

2435
01:36:48,779 --> 01:36:52,439
truth

2436
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:55,460
they're gonna be like oh well that was

2437
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:58,138
lame yeah something up I don't care

2438
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:00,899
especially when the answer is 99 of the

2439
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:03,300
time oh it's a bad seed yeah

2440
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:05,118
or yeah or you know or it happened in an

2441
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,619
accident at my buddy's house

2442
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:09,299
of this or I was you know like you know

2443
01:37:07,618 --> 01:37:11,158
you were early involved and you know the

2444
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,179
story even just knowing the story is

2445
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:14,339
cool

2446
01:37:12,179 --> 01:37:15,960
right but then people want to be part

2447
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:19,340
like they want to be this active

2448
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:21,359
component that was critical to the story

2449
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:24,420
you know

2450
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:26,399
right and I I did forget someone earlier

2451
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:28,500
that was really important when I was was

2452
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:29,879
you know coming in and it was that was

2453
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:33,000
doing reversals before I was and that

2454
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:34,739
was Rascal I I think I would be remiss

2455
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,960
not to mention him because he was doing

2456
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:38,819
good things and had legitimate Cuts you

2457
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,859
know for the most part uh as far as I

2458
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:42,420
know like he was doing good [ __ ] work

2459
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:44,279
and he was doing it at a time when it

2460
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:46,260
wasn't popular when people were pushing

2461
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:48,000
back against feminized seeds so I give

2462
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:50,280
that guy props too all the stuff that

2463
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,738
that guy made between whatever it was 09

2464
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:54,779
and 12 or whatever yeah all those

2465
01:37:52,738 --> 01:37:56,339
hybrids are fire yeah there was some

2466
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:58,979
good [ __ ] in there I mean he really

2467
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,600
maybe not all but like the vast majority

2468
01:37:58,979 --> 01:38:02,638
of the stuff he had some really nice

2469
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,980
cuts and he was crossing them together

2470
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:08,039
and they led to some really nice things

2471
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:09,479
yeah I mean white fire you know a lot of

2472
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:10,679
people don't even know like about the

2473
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:12,419
white anymore like not a lot of people

2474
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:14,219
talk about it but that was the essence

2475
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:17,279
behind the white fire that was [ __ ]

2476
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:19,880
cool right right yep

2477
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:22,319
that uh

2478
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:23,400
that's one I'd like to touch on too in

2479
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:27,059
the future

2480
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:29,879
um oh yeah they they uh you know the the

2481
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:33,780
swamp boys uh big Ricky in particular he

2482
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:35,819
uh he's alluded a lot to knowing exactly

2483
01:38:33,779 --> 01:38:39,300
what the hybrid of the white is because

2484
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:42,840
it's supposedly a TK hybrid

2485
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:44,719
um but you know he he likes riddles and

2486
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,520
secrets so

2487
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:50,399
riddles and limericks I call it a haiku

2488
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,920
hillbilly Haiku oh there he likes

2489
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:53,879
sometimes I wonder how long he takes to

2490
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,239
craft

2491
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:59,279
uh some of his Instagram posts and how

2492
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:00,718
to make it like you know he because he's

2493
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,819
got his own language

2494
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,560
correct when it comes to that you know

2495
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:07,639
have you seen have you seen stuff like

2496
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:10,980
the white inside the TKS ones yeah yeah

2497
01:39:07,639 --> 01:39:14,699
there there was a there was one plant in

2498
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:16,500
our our first run of them where

2499
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:19,079
um actually there was there was there

2500
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,939
was four plants that uh we pulled out of

2501
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:24,479
the first run

2502
01:39:20,939 --> 01:39:27,178
um and uh one was a green Girl Scout

2503
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:29,399
cookie like a green form cut

2504
01:39:27,179 --> 01:39:33,118
um other was a plant that looked just

2505
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:36,118
like the white you know not oh but so

2506
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:38,698
similar yeah it was obvious and then

2507
01:39:36,118 --> 01:39:41,579
there was the number 50 and the 51 where

2508
01:39:38,698 --> 01:39:43,618
my which were my two actual favorites of

2509
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:46,019
the whole bunch and

2510
01:39:43,618 --> 01:39:49,019
then you know I I smoked both those

2511
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:51,300
heavily and the 50 turned out to be my

2512
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:54,119
absolute favorite of the whole bunch and

2513
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:56,400
so that's the one I kept and still play

2514
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:59,759
with from the first and then I did

2515
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:03,000
another 100 plus you know TK S1 pop and

2516
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,639
you know got other selections from there

2517
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,198
yeah so Caleb what do you think about

2518
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:10,199
cookies

2519
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:11,479
uh great question someone asked what do

2520
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:14,519
you think

2521
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:15,618
uh I think that goes into the category

2522
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:20,760
of

2523
01:40:15,618 --> 01:40:21,679
2000 uh what 2010 and on for 2010 2011

2524
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:25,679
yeah

2525
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:28,319
people people ask a bunch of that and I

2526
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,480
think I mean it's a story

2527
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:32,039
you know and it's a story that like

2528
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:33,839
there's a lot of pieces that aren't

2529
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:36,238
known that well

2530
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,980
um but it's definitely one that's going

2531
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,658
to create a it's you know it's a super

2532
01:40:37,979 --> 01:40:42,019
popular brand there's a lot of money

2533
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:44,399
involved there's a lot of rep involved

2534
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:46,199
and uh it's one of those things if you

2535
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:48,719
don't get it exactly right it's going to

2586
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:57,000
aspect to it too where it's like a lot

2587
01:42:55,618 --> 01:42:58,979
of this stuff we're talking about with

2588
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,840
you guys this is what we've all been

2589
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:01,919
doing amongst each other privately for

2590
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:04,500
[ __ ] ever

2591
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,840
yeah so we've all heard each other's

2592
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:09,359
stupid [ __ ] stories 100 times you

2593
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:11,279
know and and all that and so this is

2594
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:13,500
this is really how information gets

2595
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:17,819
information and cuts gets saved and

2596
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:19,979
shared and you know history survives and

2597
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:22,439
generally the point of all this is to

2598
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:25,579
get you know versions of History out

2599
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:25,579
there and gets passed along

2600
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:31,739
