00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,880
welcome to the underground

11
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,039
hello everyone and welcome to breeders

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,960
Syndicate reviews

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,719
today we will be looking at a strain

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,780
from Santa Cruz goat farm and it is his

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,120
Afghani train wreck the first strain

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,760
we're going to check out is Afghan rails

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,280
from Santa Cruz goat farm

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,339
so as I first look at the buds it's very

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,280
very dense especially for a train wreck

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,699
hybrid but it's not as dense as say a

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,039
cookies or a kush or an OG uh

22
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,738
looking at it it's very very resinous

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,840
lots of trichomes amazing resin

24
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,658
production as as you usually find in

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
train wreck hybrids train wrecks a a

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,640
very nice resin producer though it does

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,099
have short resin glands and stalks

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,239
um now the first smell I smell

29
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,239
when breaking it up

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,599
there is a soapiness that is like OG but

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,460
it's not OG like I wouldn't smell this

32
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,339
and immediately go that's got OG in it

33
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,899
it's it's it's an old Afghani type smell

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,520
that I usually associate with old

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,580
Afghans

36
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,579
um

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,280
there's also a lot of funk there's some

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,400
skunkiness to it

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
and again typical of old Afghans I

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,880
believe this Afghan is supposed to be

41
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:53,279
from 1988 an old Santa Cruz uh special

42
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,259
um so yeah that's that's I mean it's got

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,820
the earthy tones it's even got some

44
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,478
chocolate

45
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:02,639
um lots of Funk it's got clean tones

46
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,618
almost like laundry along with the

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,079
soapiness which is really unique it's

48
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,179
it's got a really unique terpene profile

49
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,579
and at first glance

50
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,479
um you know it looks like an old Afghan

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,760
type but the complexity of the terpene

52
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,619
profile really really stands out so I'm

53
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,000
pretty impressed so far let's give this

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,039
a smoke

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
so when doing reviews I always like to

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,780
make sure whatever piece I'm smoking out

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,360
of is completely clean just as if the

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,640
day it was bought you know totally clean

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,379
no resin I want to be able to taste

60
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,119
everything I want to I want to taste all

61
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,459
the complexities I want to be able to

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,739
smell the complexities as I bring the

63
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,479
pipe up to my mouth there's a lot to it

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,099
but the main important thing is keep

65
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,719
your water clean keep your piece clean

66
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,159
if you're going to be doing reviews and

67
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,759
really trying to figure out what's going

68
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,919
on with the high and and how a strain

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,120
interacts with your body best

70
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,119
so let's check it out

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,120
so I can taste the soapiness

72
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,979
there was almost a tobacco note that

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,319
came with it which is really weird I've

74
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,378
never really tasted that in cannabis

75
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,378
um

76
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,280
the little bit of terpenoline from the

77
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,378
the train wreck really does give you a

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,479
mouthful of flavor it's very special

79
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:30,479
very unique

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,859
um the highs very quick very quick I

81
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,500
think I can already feel it sitting in

82
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,440
the back of my eyes so like most Afghans

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,080
do it does have a very narcotic body

84
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,519
high type it immediately sits right

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,519
behind my eyes and now remember

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,959
everybody is going to feel the different

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,719
reaction due to their brain chemistry

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,120
and how certain cannabinoids affect a

89
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,818
person everybody's brain chemistry is

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,400
different so when you go into a

91
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,199
dispensary and someone tells you that a

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,780
plant will always affect you a certain

93
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,939
way indica's always do this sativas

94
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,799
always do that please don't take it at

95
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,919
face value there's no one who can tell

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,659
you exactly how any any strain will

97
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,458
affect you at any certain time of the

98
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:12,780
day I mean certain strains I can smoke

99
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,158
in the morning the first smoke of the

100
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,500
day and it'll affect me much different

101
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,139
than it would right before bed so that's

102
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,259
that's something to keep in mind too

103
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,439
um so yeah I give this a 5 out of five I

104
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:28,199
love old afghanis I love train wreck and

105
