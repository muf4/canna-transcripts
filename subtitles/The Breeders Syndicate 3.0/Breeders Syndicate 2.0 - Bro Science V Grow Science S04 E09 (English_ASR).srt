1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,638
foreign

2
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,179
what's up everyone

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,000
I started a little early just to let the

4
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,920
crowd build up before

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,920
old so not dog gets here

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,600
how y'all doing

7
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,979
what the [ __ ] is up

8
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,939
I was just looking at this old this uh

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,520
old hip BC catalog and thinking

10
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,558
how nice would it be to have some of

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,118
that nl5 purple Indica I think that

12
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,579
would be really cool

13
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,700
and I think I think we might have just

14
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,438
made some yeah but I would be interested

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,659
to see what the um

16
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,919
the BC purple Indica is like how much

17
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,560
different it is

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,400
and like this nl5 Hawaiian Indica now

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,859
this is the BCC code stuff which is uh

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,000
probably five by two not just five but

21
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,000
we we don't know for sure

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,540
either way very cool

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,519
but I'll

24
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,859
anyway so yeah I was just shooting this

25
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,819
[ __ ] trying to build [ __ ] up before

26
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,819
dude gets here

27
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,879
but yeah

28
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,039
so what's the haps ladies and gents

29
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,478
today we are going to talk about I

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,979
actually have it written down I wrote

31
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,019
things down this time tried to be more

32
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,299
organized for y'all

33
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,978
because I'm not usually

34
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,960
so this is going to be it's going to

35
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,539
start off as the Bro Science episode

36
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,879
which is essentially like different

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,680
things you hear in cannabis that like

38
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,299
you're you're pretty sure are real or

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,939
but they just turn out to be old wives

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,860
tales no offense to any old wives

41
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,500
hanging around

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,660
um yeah so we thought that would be cool

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,159
when someone gave us that idea and I

44
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,719
think that's

45
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,719
that's what's up

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,500
um from the Hawaiian light stuff

47
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,120
probably the dog [ __ ] Hawaiian lights

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,400
just because of all the unique

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,840
possibilities that come from it I think

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
that's probably going to be the one in

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
the bomb threat of course because bomb

52
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,519
threat to this [ __ ]

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,539
here we go

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:47,120
here's the so nut dog as Darby's lapping

55
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,120
up a pool of water all loud as [ __ ]

56
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,919
evening

57
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,679
yo yo yo yo yo yo what are you doing

58
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,419
hiding from the heat yeah me too dude I

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,140
have a fan on right now is it is the

60
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:04,079
audio weird at all no okay good I don't

61
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,119
think so oh yeah does it smell good yeah

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
oh sorry Bryn just brought us home some

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,400
stuff from Trader Joe's someone's a

64
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,079
strawberry lemon scrub huh

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,939
yeah

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,560
I wish I had a sense of smell that's

67
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,878
good

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
yeah

69
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,340
so what's up um I wrote down a bunch of

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,420
stuff today to go over and I don't know

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,920
if you had a chance to write anything

72
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,500
down or do you have anything you want to

73
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,259
just start off the Jump with we could

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,560
start off the Jump I mean so we thought

75
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,679
we would talk for a bit uh about

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,900
uh Bro Science versus real science hold

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,540
on let's start off actually let's do a

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,599
um a quick uh I don't know what you'd

79
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,060
call it just say uh this is you know

80
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,719
this is what we know as best as we know

81
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,000
it right now I am often wrong constantly

82
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,459
wrong and and

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,259
um you know [ __ ] updates all the time so

84
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,180
this is as best as we know it right now

85
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,579
as we are trying to bring it to you but

86
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,620
uh if you find something different and

87
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,080
uh have a strong opinion on it let us

88
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,019
know we're always open to new

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,780
um suggestions and ideas so yeah it is

90
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,459
because there's uh yeah I mean that that

91
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,500
could go for almost any show when we

92
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,358
talk about history or this or that or

93
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,000
whatever yeah we're trying to give you

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,399
like a version that we hope is pretty

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,959
accurate you know and and so on and so

96
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,719
forth but there's areas where you can

97
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,120
misspeak you know or just areas where

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,680
that later on you get a detail comes on

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,280
that changes your perspective on

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,840
something too sure so for a long time

101
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,339
yeah actually our buddy just said we

102
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,619
should maybe even talk about that like

103
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,599
flush versus no flush yeah that's

104
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,360
actually a really good one but

105
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,879
the whole idea is more of like now that

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
cannabis is becoming legal uh and

107
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,079
medical and all this different stuff

108
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,079
there's an aspect where actual science

109
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,240
is getting used on it yeah where for a

110
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,740
long time uh the science that was

111
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,079
getting used on it was actually pretty

112
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,439
limited and so we were left with a lot

113
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,120
of observational stuff yeah and

114
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,100
um you know like breeding and stuff like

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,800
that and Punnett squares all that like

116
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,919
like taking other Knowledge from other

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,860
forms of plant breeding and work and

118
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,319
trying to apply it to weed yeah you know

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,319
and it's only really been probably the

120
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,620
last 10 years I would say

121
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,079
someone asked me to Blink you know five

122
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,939
five maybe ten years that it's opened up

123
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,279
enough that

124
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,219
um like more science is being done on

125
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,079
things yeah and not only that not only

126
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,840
more science is being done but like more

127
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,839
reputable scientists in their field are

128
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:46,198
willing to get involved yeah and give

129
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,659
their opinions on stuff you know and and

130
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,120
so like kind of like a theme of like

131
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,380
what what we knew then versus what we

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,600
know now

133
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:56,339
yes you know and because a lot of this

134
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,500
information in you know history and

135
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,319
otherwise the science part is no

136
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,319
different a lot of it is is oral

137
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,259
yes it's like passed down it's passed

138
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
down from older stoners to you yeah you

139
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,400
know you hear about it through people

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,139
you respect and and all this different

141
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,758
types of stuff

142
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,800
um and so

143
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,020
you know there's that's kind of how

144
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,300
information was disseminated

145
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,478
yes

146
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,300
amongst groups yep forums and and little

147
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,159
bbs's back in the day yeah or yeah

148
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,978
little little friend circles oh yeah

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,600
little friend circles at the grow store

150
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:35,459
circles little this and that the the few

151
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,220
books or a few stuff or most people

152
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,959
would just read stuff from other

153
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,120
disciplines yeah

154
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,579
right and try to apply it to weed as

155
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,100
best they could adapt yeah

156
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,379
and so people like even in the sense of

157
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,419
like the even in the sense of

158
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,339
um like medical information Matt and I

159
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,258
were talking about this where it's like

160
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,899
for a long time it was it you know it

161
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,580
still is it was a schedule one drug

162
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,659
um and so you needed the dea's

163
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,399
permission to even study it because you

164
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,180
couldn't possess it legally without

165
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,038
their say-so right yeah so for like 40

166
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,620
years they would do this thing where

167
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,599
they would only approve studies looking

168
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,019
for cannabis harm

169
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,520
yeah so if you said your study was I

170
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,818
want to look and see if it shrinks

171
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,500
Matt's balls and gives him anxiety and

172
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,660
shortens his lifespan they'd be like

173
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,939
here's some weed go test it yeah and

174
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,400
they'd find out it absolutely does so

175
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,139
weird but if you wanted to say yeah I

176
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,779
want to see if it lowers not so dogs

177
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,879
freaking you know blood pressure and

178
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,579
like you know increases his appetite and

179
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,978
lowers his his stress noses estrogen

180
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,918
yeah whatever the case may be they would

181
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:48,959
deny it yeah what happened is is that

182
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,379
they ended up you got like 40 you got 40

183
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,258
years plus of science looking for

184
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,418
cannabis harms yeah because they wanted

185
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,120
data points that could prove their case

186
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:02,098
and make keeping it illegal and keeping

187
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,680
it the way that it was to have like

188
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:07,139
scientific backing yeah right propaganda

189
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,759
yeah so as a result of that we have a

190
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,500
lot of knowledge and we have a lot of

191
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,598
extensive studies on what the worst

192
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,519
stuff that cannabis does because that's

193
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,339
all they were looking for but we have

194
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,318
relatively little [ __ ] it on what it's

195
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,959
good for yeah

196
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,879
and you know and even stuff like you

197
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,000
know we're gonna have a upcoming episode

198
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,680
where it's all about uh Aromas and

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,478
scents and terpenes and all this

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,879
different stuff but even just the

201
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,879
terpene itself aspect

202
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,860
yeah right and like and and the the

203
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,799
names behind those things rather than

204
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,719
people just describing Aromas yeah 20

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,120
years ago people weren't talking Terps

206
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
yeah I still suck at that part myself

207
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,259
right or even like knowing what the

208
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,000
Terps are knowing how they combine yeah

209
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,419
you know I mean like if you take art

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,339
there's only so many primary colors yeah

211
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,500
but you start blending those primary

212
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,720
colors and you can get all these

213
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,820
different shades right 16 million

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,620
something like that yeah and you know to

215
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,899
some degree scents are like that too you

216
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,278
start blending terpenes and theols and

217
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,120
all these other things that I'll

218
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:14,100
mispronounce yeah but you know like when

219
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,899
we were getting into cannabis none of

220
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,420
that stuff was being studied on any kind

221
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,059
of accessible level no

222
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,159
it just doesn't exist no like the

223
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,338
closest I saw like when I was getting in

224
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,139
was DJs all at like olfactory but that

225
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,899
was entire that was cool but that was

226
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,899
more like a wine yeah more like a

227
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,720
training your nose to other things you

228
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,940
might recognize as a scent yeah that

229
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,160
wasn't so much science like so a lot of

230
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,800
a lot of Bro Science ends up just being

231
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,799
like observational [ __ ] that may or may

232
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,500
not be right yeah yeah you know like I

233
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,659
joked with Matt on an earlier podcast or

234
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,759
whatever that you know back in the day

235
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,458
like we used to put our favorite nugget

236
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,559
Mexican in the resin chamber look at

237
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,979
resin Chambers and you'd smoke and you'd

238
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,139
smoke that last because the the you know

239
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,639
the science was you're gonna coat that

240
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:10,559
bud and all that unburned THC and resin

241
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,720
[ __ ] resin yeah and then the last nug

242
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,579
you smoke of your bag is the best one

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,379
because it's coated in all that extra

244
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,360
free goo that's going to get you high

245
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,299
yeah

246
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,060
is if you scrape scrape the the resin

247
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,740
chamber first and then coat that on the

248
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,599
outside of the bud too that really helps

249
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,360
but that was I mean that was like that

250
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,639
was accepted science knowledge in my

251
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,980
crew oh yeah for sure for sure it was

252
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,539
super common common in the 80s and 90s

253
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,300
or whatever right and you so you take

254
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,980
your best bud and you ruin it yeah

255
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:42,719
right and then you'd like sit there and

256
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,480
smoke it it would burn all funny because

257
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,019
it had all this like wet yeah you know

258
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,399
metal pipe goo

259
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,379
but that was accepted that was that was

260
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,179
the accepted thing to do you you that

261
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,220
was the resin they put that there so you

262
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,019
could fit a butt in and resonate the

263
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,600
butt yeah

264
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,339
that's funny dude uh because we didn't

265
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,659
have any science to tell us otherwise

266
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:09,060
yeah no it stunk we knew that much

267
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:09,958
yeah it's done we we knew that much you

268
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,699
know

269
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,859
um but that that was accepted you know

270
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,839
there used to be a thing uh which is

271
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,060
funny now because when you dig into

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:23,160
history uh most fire is harm but I mean

273
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,359
it used to be accepted Bro Science right

274
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,100
that

275
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,500
um you know seeds from hermaphrodites

276
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,720
were shittier yeah that's that's bad

277
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,820
that's and that like you don't if you

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,278
use that like you could [ __ ] up the line

279
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,480
you wanted like straight male female

280
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,299
mating

281
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,519
yeah that was the way to go and if you

282
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,319
it you know if you you know popped

283
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,940
Hermes seeds the chances that it would

284
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,959
be Hermie and he'd never be able to get

285
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,360
it out

286
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,599
so a lot of people were scared of of

287
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,000
beans and buds yeah and they also uh the

288
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,639
the conclusion was that Herms had low

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,860
THC every time too you know yeah and

290
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,539
then that was a big one the Kush and the

291
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,240
sour diesel and like a million

292
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:05,879
phenomenal Fireweed is all like hermy

293
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,740
bag seed yeah you know but like we

294
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,139
didn't understand breeding enough the

295
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,680
science of breeding you know we thought

296
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,139
that like if you did a male female you

297
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,439
probably wouldn't get the Herm Gene yeah

298
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:21,179
but if you harmed uh you know not that

299
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,800
if the plant harmed it obviously had the

300
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,958
gene yeah

301
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,519
because it hurt yeah because it hurt

302
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,719
because it hurt you know it's like

303
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,980
that's what it did it already had the

304
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,500
gene in it or it wouldn't have done it

305
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,940
yeah that's a special Gene that that

306
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,220
isn't in most cannabis it kind of

307
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,459
breaded out the hurricane

308
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,379
so we had to so we had to uh proto pipes

309
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,239
are actually made in one town north of

310
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,740
me in Willits

311
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,240
um they're still made there a little

312
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:51,060
shop you know the Proto pipe strangely

313
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,060
that was a classic Early Head Shop metal

314
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,039
pipe yeah you know it had the lid that

315
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:58,199
went on the top and it had the scraper

316
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,319
and it had the little resin chamber it

317
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,540
had the whole thing you know yeah and um

318
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,000
and so you know so a lot of this stuff

319
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,679
is like you start smoking and you start

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,500
learning the Legends and the [ __ ] like

321
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,719
that around your little circle and then

322
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,339
you start reading some books you know

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
and that's kind of where like Bro

324
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,060
Science comes from Bro Science is like

325
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,099
people observing stuff

326
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,559
and then saying it's true and then other

327
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,500
people around you agree and then it sort

328
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,939
of gains weight yeah because like a

329
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,679
bunch of people are saying it and then

330
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,240
you're telling some you know some

331
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,519
younger person than you about it and

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,360
they just buy it hook line and sinker oh

333
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,039
yeah

334
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,159
yeah

335
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,778
so yeah I mean now obviously like with

336
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,819
um you know with feminized breeding and

337
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:45,120
stuff like that like that the whole

338
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,160
science of you know or even like even

339
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,919
here's another Bro Science thing like

340
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,578
Matt and I were chatting about which is

341
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,838
um

342
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:57,000
you know pale seeds are bad yes and the

343
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,160
best healthiest most mature seeds are

344
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,159
all dark and have tiger stripes yes

345
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,319
and there is some truth to like fully

346
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,138
tiger striped seeds are mature for the

347
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,660
most part and pale seeds can be immature

348
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,079
yes but as any breeder will tell you

349
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:18,179
that that tiger stripe is a skin yeah

350
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,199
it's a thin little layer like an onion

351
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:23,879
skin almost on the seed

352
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,440
if you blow your seeds like we all do

353
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,600
you know like

354
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,600
we we actually put it through a blower

355
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,278
and it and it blows the the husks off

356
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,360
and whatnot it's very easy for him to

357
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,759
get knocked around and knock the tiger

358
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,079
stripe off so yeah and and there's also

359
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,600
the fact that you know like they're

360
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:42,419
they're a little tiny African land race

361
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,339
seeds that are like yeah big that are

362
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,620
totally black or totally gray you know

363
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,260
it just really depends on the region the

364
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,000
type uh the type of pollen the the

365
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,980
maturity of the pollen hitting the plant

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,320
what part of the plant was making the

367
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,778
seed all sorts of stuff goes into that

368
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,899
so but in the back in the day it was

369
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:02,639
pale seeds bad yeah yeah and it's still

370
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,220
and it still persists I mean I was

371
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,320
having a talk uh this week with our our

372
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,379
homie Caleb and he was saying that like

373
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,079
you know a lot a lot of seed he throws

374
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,179
into the not good pile yeah but it would

375
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,458
have pretty damn High germination rates

376
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,259
yeah most of the stuff that like if if

377
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,659
anything's even remotely great even if I

378
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,698
know that's like genetic on it and it's

379
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,139
just what it is I won't sell it because

380
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:26,939
I know that it's just going to cause

381
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,320
problems people don't yeah and he'll say

382
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,139
you know he'll start out with a bunch of

383
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,399
dark tiger stripe seeds and you put them

384
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,198
through the blower and you put them in

385
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,639
some bags and you handle them and all

386
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,259
that and then at the end there's one or

387
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,339
two that have it and the rest of the

388
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:43,559
pack is is doesn't have it anymore yeah

389
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,000
so you know

390
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,759
um but that was like straight science

391
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,139
like if you got all white seeds was a

392
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,778
sign of immaturity

393
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,278
what's one of the most extreme ones you

394
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:54,419
think you've heard when it comes to Bro

395
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,639
Science

396
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,419
I mean I think I started with it with

397
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,519
the with the put resonate your buds but

398
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,740
um that's a good one yeah that one and

399
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,600
the and the hermaphrodism contaminating

400
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,600
everything forevermore

401
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,839
and ruining your weed I had a good one

402
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,079
and this was uh early on when I lived in

403
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,060
in Isla Vista I had a dude come up to me

404
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,620
at a party and tell me that he he shocks

405
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,518
his plants with batteries to turn them

406
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,379
purple

407
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,778
I think at some point somebody told him

408
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:28,259
that they shocked their plant meaning

409
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:30,659
shock it with you know cold or extreme

410
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,360
temperatures and he took that to mean oh

411
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,120
I put my car battery hook that [ __ ] up

412
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,100
[ __ ] jump that [ __ ] and turns it

413
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,539
purple so that was one of my favorites

414
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,519
that you shock your plants with

415
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,319
electricity to turn them purple there

416
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
was there was always some and and the

417
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,360
and the issue is is that you know when

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,220
it like because when Bro Science ended

419
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,399
it wasn't like it was amazing either

420
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,399
because uh when actual science started

421
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,980
getting into play before when all we had

422
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,278
was observational traits yeah almost all

423
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,679
breeding was all selection was done uh

424
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,078
based on obser observable

425
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,298
characteristics yeah because that's all

426
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,039
you had yeah that's how you grow how did

427
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,078
it look what the leaves look like what

428
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,720
the resin content did how did it burn

429
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,759
what it taste like and then once you

430
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,740
started getting all this data people

431
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,220
started trying to incorporate all this

432
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,500
data into breeding yeah and a lot of

433
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,000
them [ __ ] it up I like that someone

434
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,099
brought up the Kool-Aid one that was

435
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,200
another fave the what and feeding the

436
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:34,379
plants Kool-Aid to turn them purple or

437
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,740
oh yeah yeah adding flavors through the

438
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,539
roots yeah yeah and make some cherry uh

439
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,819
that way with some Kool-Aid powder to

440
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:43,679
the roots yeah I mean now it is the one

441
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,779
thing that is true is that if you do if

442
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,600
if you do there's a plant that has a

443
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:50,759
propensity to turn purple

444
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,219
you can shock it sometimes with cold

445
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,960
yeah yeah that's a that's a common one

446
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,480
that's a common one that one's actually

447
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,980
true you know yeah it's got started

448
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,740
mostly when you get some cold snap

449
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,419
nights out here outdoor style yeah and

450
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,980
you'd see some stuff that had been green

451
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,720
all summer and all of a sudden it went

452
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,819
dark on you yeah all of a sudden it was

453
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,980
[ __ ] black and then you'll see you'll

454
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,659
see some people like you know trying all

455
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,179
that like pouring ice on top of their

456
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,919
weed and door yeah trying to get that

457
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,538
color change because all of a sudden

458
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,240
color is important for the last few

459
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:23,220
years again you know yeah

460
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,919
um yeah you know sugar water to make it

461
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,798
Frosty I don't even I think most sugar

462
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,419
water like the the the pores on the

463
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,599
roots are too small to even absorb it

464
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,580
yeah it's mostly there to like feed the

465
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,859
microbiome or whatever that's in your

466
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,480
soil Mass more so than it is to like

467
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,798
shoot up your plant you know yeah

468
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,500
exactly

469
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,079
but but yeah I mean it's like so all you

470
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,599
had back in the day was Legends and

471
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,298
people trading information and that's

472
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,240
why so many of us like look look at like

473
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:56,460
Rob Clark's book like the Bible for a

474
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,419
breeding yeah because it was lit like

475
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,419
did he have competition

476
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,558
not really I mean later they're a weird

477
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,880
reading book

478
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,918
not necessarily no other than that one

479
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,660
you know during that era later on I mean

480
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,400
Greg green had his breeders Bible but

481
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,279
that was much later that was way way

482
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,840
later yeah exactly so not really no I

483
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,418
mean he was like basically like the only

484
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,879
person on the hill yeah so if you wanted

485
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,380
to learn how to breed and how cannabis

486
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,200
even worked

487
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,299
you know uh that was where you went

488
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,360
yeah and we got very fortunate that he

489
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:34,558
got so much of it right for so long we

490
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,199
were very fortunate because it could

491
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,759
have been anyone doing that and getting

492
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,660
it very wrong and it probably would have

493
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:44,220
been passed as uh you know Canon forever

494
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,960
someone just asked me if I have any

495
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,579
advice on Greenhouse that's like pretty

496
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,160
General and yeah I've grown in

497
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,439
greenhouses for decades so

498
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,779
um yes but I don't know what

499
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,038
um but you know yeah there was there was

500
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:57,779
you know there was all this stuff and

501
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,579
there was all this experimentation going

502
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,720
on and it was like they were looking for

503
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:06,480
harm in weed yeah um and you know nobody

504
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,058
knew I don't think when was the first

505
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,919
time you even heard the word CBN or CBG

506
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:13,859
or CBD

507
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,360
it was pretty early on but I think most

508
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,479
people didn't know the difference

509
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:22,019
between CBG and CBN at the time you know

510
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,160
you know I mean I I like we we got some

511
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,440
like we you know we used to call it

512
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,058
pretendica we got bunked a few times by

513
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,600
what we thought was kind bud and it was

514
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:32,099
gorgeous hemp yeah gorgeous hemp yeah or

515
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,159
it was gorgeous hemp yeah it looked like

516
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:37,019
it looked like 400 an ounce weed yeah

517
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,480
but the mech but the green Mexican Got

518
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,038
You Higher yeah but I mean I remember at

519
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,720
that time you know in Chicago or

520
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,058
whatever I didn't even I didn't even

521
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,558
realize that hemp had those things yeah

522
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:48,359
I didn't even know that hemp looked like

523
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,980
weed back then like I didn't even know

524
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,139
that they looked they could be confused

525
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,179
for each other at all like that we in

526
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,100
SoCal we had no experience with hemp

527
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,019
except for when they would bring you

528
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,980
know this gorgeous looking [ __ ]

529
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,480
reddish beautiful Frosty Indica in and

530
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,179
we're like game and we're paying the

531
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,099
same price as the max all right score

532
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,080
yeah

533
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,959
yeah pretendica I mean we called it

534
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,579
ditch weed and Illinois yeah because it

535
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,980
grew in ditches and it grew at the edges

536
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,798
of fields and it grew wild there was a

537
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,919
wild population from World War II you

538
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,900
know all through the Midwest basically

539
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,780
um but yeah I didn't I mean you know now

540
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,659
it's like now now I know it was up but

541
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,779
then we were so confused yeah it was how

542
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:35,400
weed that could look that good and yeah

543
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,079
and like you'd smoke it and smoke you're

544
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,940
taking bong hit after your bong hit yeah

545
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,038
it feels a little funny and you're like

546
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,600
I don't feel high at all yeah you know

547
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,879
and you smoke a joint of Mexican and

548
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,219
you're like oh it worked dude those guys

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,159
must have been making a killing selling

550
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,798
that you know 60 an ounce well the thing

551
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,320
about the thing about my area was is

552
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,119
that there was brown Mexican and there

553
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,678
was green Mexican and anything better

554
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,379
than that was kind bud that went for

555
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,900
expensive yeah

556
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,059
you know I mean he like they did the

557
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,980
quality only made the price go up but it

558
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,899
was like even the shitty stuff was still

559
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,159
we'll go by Mexican

560
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,019
yeah

561
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,700
that's what always killed me like ours

562
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,379
like it would have way less seeds you

563
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,659
know it was it was really beautiful

564
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,039
looking but it would it was always the

565
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,380
same price as the Mexican it would

566
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,000
always blow my mind that anyone was so

567
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,620
dumb they'd sell this for the same price

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,440
but then you know every single time I'd

569
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:31,079
get [ __ ] skunked on it you get

570
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,640
skunked on it yeah and so there's

571
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,000
there's an aspect too where it's like

572
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,159
what's interesting is that so and I

573
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,038
don't know why this is necessarily but

574
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,580
it does seem like when with testing

575
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:47,460
low THC doesn't get you as high

576
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:50,399
yeah but then it also seems like once

577
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,259
there's enough THC it doesn't seem to

578
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,380
matter and then when there's too much

579
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:58,980
THC it seems to get in the way yeah

580
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,659
because most of our like famous Elite

581
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,579
strains at least the ones that I

582
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,919
personally like to smoke a bunch yeah

583
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:07,918
they seem to come in between 18 and 25

584
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,559
mostly yeah

585
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,659
you know yeah makes sense and all these

586
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,579
like 30 plusers or whatever and I don't

587
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,740
even think like when when THC testing

588
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:18,599
started there was almost no 30 plusers

589
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,058
yeah I know because there wasn't many

590
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,859
there wasn't any testing selection that

591
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,558
allowed people to see

592
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,418
higher numbers I'll select those yeah

593
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,158
and obviously without those numbers

594
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:31,200
there no one selected those they weren't

595
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,760
as good yeah I mean but how would you

596
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,558
really tell a lot of the stuff that

597
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,679
would get you the most high would be the

598
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,779
you know 14 percenters to 18 percenters

599
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,820
yeah or like you know a lot a lot of the

600
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,259
you know the sour diesel and the cabin a

601
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,960
lot of those things are like in the low

602
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,359
to mid 20s yeah you know really good

603
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,960
chem dog can be as low as 17 it can be

604
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,859
17 to 22 yeah you know it knocks my head

605
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,500
off

606
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,000
but it's only it's not that high you

607
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,700
know so you need a certain amount of it

608
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,919
but like nobody had any idea what any th

609
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,140
percentage I mean when was THC

610
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,820
percentage even a thing probably not

611
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,320
until like 809 2010 2012 when

612
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,418
collectives are getting popular I

613
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,158
remember even past that it took a long

614
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,038
time before collectives started posting

615
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,780
THC percentages on the regular yeah I

616
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,579
mean I think I was smoking for 20 plus

617
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:23,099
years before

618
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,439
there was any verified ability to get

619
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:27,359
weed tested for percentages that you

620
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,519
could access yeah

621
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,019
it just didn't exist like weed was good

622
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,859
because it smelled good and it worked

623
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,139
good

624
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:36,538
and you and you wanted it yeah I

625
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,320
actually can remember pretty well when

626
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:40,019
um

627
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,058
Mitch from the Adam Dunn show back when

628
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,918
he was one of the main hosts on that

629
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,839
show he brought on a bunch of the

630
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,400
testing labs and it just started popping

631
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,980
up and we were just beginning to

632
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,080
understand what a THC standard was why

633
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,240
there was no consistency between two

634
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,918
different Labs all that stuff and I

635
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,500
remember he brought them on iron Labs

636
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,020
Michigan SC labs and a few others and

637
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,599
they ended up all slowly hanging up on

638
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,339
the [ __ ] podcast and the calls

639
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,538
because the questions got too [ __ ]

640
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,058
complicated and they didn't want to

641
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:12,798
answer that [ __ ] so yeah it was it was

642
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:15,839
later it definitely was later yeah 2010.

643
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,980
yeah so what that meant was that for a

644
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,519
long time

645
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,700
almost all breeding selection was done

646
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,639
based on your ability to to uh to Ops

647
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,440
you know to to look yeah you know how

648
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,179
does it grow how does it yield what does

649
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,798
it look like you know what does it smell

650
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,200
like what does it burn like what does it

651
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,879
smoke like yeah and now I think part of

652
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,159
the modern problem with science is

653
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,740
you've got people that like think that

654
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,140
they can grow by numbers yeah and

655
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,480
they're just looking at charts

656
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,620
and they're looking for higher THC and

657
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,179
they're looking for certain high

658
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:51,719
terpenes and they're looking for this

659
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,519
and that and the selection of like I

660
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,440
mean this sounds really bro but like the

661
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,240
selection of like six or seven friends

662
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,278
smoking a bunch of joints and saying

663
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,919
what they think yeah

664
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,359
is often more effective than any kind of

665
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,400
chart so far

666
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,079
yeah because at the end of the day it's

667
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,220
all about whether or not humans like to

668
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,079
consume it

669
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,538
at the end of the day robots don't smoke

670
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,460
weed [ __ ] the man

671
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,259
yeah well it's like it's this weird

672
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,600
thing too we're like I'm not a musician

673
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,940
Matt is but there's an aspect in like

674
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,519
musical reproduction where like some

675
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:28,940
level of distortion and some harmonics

676
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,940
are better than others yeah right

677
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,480
oh did he freeze he froze up he froze up

678
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,340
on a smile

679
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,620
maybe he's getting a phone call I don't

680
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:43,038
know maybe I froze up who knows I guess

681
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,038
we'll see

682
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,900
not bad

683
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,019
not back yet

684
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,519
yeah I also had um oh he left so if you

685
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,859
must have got the phone call or booted

686
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,759
or something anyways I have also had on

687
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:08,278
here

688
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,259
um one of my favorites all reversal

689
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,880
sprays colloidal silver I get that

690
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,759
Non-Stop

691
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,159
all the time no matter how many times I

692
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:20,579
post my spray some will chime in and be

693
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:23,100
like colloidal silver it's just [ __ ]

694
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,619
colloidal silver no one asks about it

695
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,778
nobody you know it's an assumption but

696
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,959
yeah that's one of them also I I

697
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:32,940
remember aspirin uh for reversals was

698
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,919
another favorite of mine that people

699
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,320
would use aspirins for their reversals

700
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,120
but um I'm shocked people don't actually

701
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:40,859
say that anymore and mostly I just hear

702
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,178
colloidal silver and that's that's what

703
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,759
does it all

704
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,740
that's what does it all I'm back all

705
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,000
right where'd you go I don't know did

706
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,500
all of a sudden you had this weird look

707
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,480
on your face and I realized you were

708
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,298
frozen and then I was gone and it said

709
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,419
basically thanks for playing yeah I got

710
00:27:54,298 --> 00:28:00,418
an IG message and I was gone so yeah you

711
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,038
know it didn't like me it kicked me yeah

712
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,960
kicked me I was about to drop some

713
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,278
secrets in the Illuminati stepped in and

714
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,220
was like no we're gonna change the

715
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,500
subject [ __ ] never gonna work never

716
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,380
gonna work

717
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,000
someone did talk about also in the um

718
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,860
comments that I thought was funny and a

719
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,259
good one was harvest in the dark King

720
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:22,459
your plants upside down so the THC flows

721
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:22,460
to the top of the colas

722
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,480
that is that is that is some Bro Science

723
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,400
it is strangely enough you definitely

724
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,740
want to hang your plant upside down but

725
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,080
for different reasons yeah

726
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,759
um but yeah there was there is some

727
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,038
weird stuff that I don't know if it's

728
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,798
true or not where people talk about

729
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:42,599
harvesting in the night time

730
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,700
um Harvest having certain amounts of

731
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,139
dark Cycles because they want the resin

732
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,240
to be in a certain State when they

733
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,600
harvest yeah

734
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,599
um you know the only thing

735
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:57,178
THC was supposedly supposedly THC is

736
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,639
strongest in the plant at in during the

737
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,259
dark cycle that was the old claim I

738
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,120
don't know if that's true or not but I I

739
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:05,519
I don't know I've seen some scientific

740
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,918
stuff that says yeah actually you know

741
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,839
harvesting in the dark is is when it is

742
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,220
you know whatever that one I don't know

743
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,599
the answer to there's a lot of this

744
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,400
stuff that's going to get proven or

745
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,918
disproven over time

746
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,840
yeah you know and some of it like some

747
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,120
of it like how good is weed or like what

748
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,859
does the testing do for us

749
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,719
um we're gonna have to interpret that

750
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:27,658
how well we think it's working ourselves

751
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,960
yeah because it's obviously like not

752
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:33,899
just raw numbers when it's a consumable

753
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,659
that produces an effect on humans yeah

754
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:39,119
like at the end of the day that's what's

755
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:42,299
important yeah that's all we care about

756
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,579
right is like how that that effect of

757
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:47,278
once we consume it however you're

758
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,720
consuming it you know uh and that you

759
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,079
can't I don't know that we understand

760
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,759
numbers that lead to specifics yeah I

761
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,798
don't know like we don't even know we

762
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,298
don't know why what's interesting is you

763
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,599
look at and that's one of the reasons

764
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:03,000
why uh the THC numbers is so bunk is

765
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,339
because I think there's like a big like

766
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,099
misunderstanding about THC percentage

767
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:10,500
and people view it like it's alcohol

768
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:13,259
yeah where like stronger is better it's

769
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,058
more potent with [ __ ] up yeah but for

770
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:17,038
me it's more like

771
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:20,398
you know since there's so many kinds of

772
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,259
highs like what's the mat what's the

773
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,719
math what's the testing that shows you

774
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,099
this is going to be a racy Buzz yeah

775
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,319
that's gonna make you want to crawl out

776
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:29,819
of your skin yeah this one's going to

777
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,980
make you uncomfortable this one's going

778
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,960
to make you alcohol kind of has the same

779
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,839
effects all the way up depending on your

780
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,058
tolerance yeah but weed does wildly

781
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,220
different [ __ ] yeah to everyone

782
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:44,460
Depending on time of the day where

783
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,740
you're smoking type of strain Everything

784
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,538
Everything Changes

785
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,960
well yeah people someone just said isn't

786
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:55,440
science proof uh science is proof but

787
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:59,759
like what's not proof is that THC by

788
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,460
itself detonates how strong a strain is

789
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,819
yeah this isn't a quantifiable science

790
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,919
yet uh High experience is not

791
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:10,918
quantifiable so technically right now

792
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,140
science can only take it so far I mean

793
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,820
it's a number in humans like numbers and

794
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,159
they like playing with numbers and it's

795
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:19,200
the one that everybody recognizes

796
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,659
yeah but there's actually a pretty big

797
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,298
movement to get away from THC numbers at

798
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,159
all yeah it would be nice but I think

799
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:28,798
that would take so long I mean we're

800
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,480
still we're still calling stuff like I

801
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,298
mean people are still saying you know oh

802
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,159
I'll [ __ ] sativas do this all hybrids

803
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:37,918
do this all indicates do that you know

804
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,299
like we're still at that stage so it's

805
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,919
been a long time I'm gonna remember this

806
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:42,418
one because this dude just said flushing

807
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,419
is a myth and that's probably actually

808
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,740
something cool to chat about but yeah uh

809
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,620
one of the things that we haven't talked

810
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,740
about there was a super bro myth is the

811
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:55,199
uh is um you know you can tell indica

812
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,859
versus sativa versus broadleaf versus

813
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,259
thin Leaf yes and when you see extreme

814
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,418
broadleaf that's how you know it's more

815
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,339
indica and when you see thin leaves

816
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,159
that's how you know there's some sativa

817
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:10,558
in there and that there's also a high

818
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,820
associated with each if you see those

819
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,339
big broad leaves you know it's going to

820
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,359
make you go like uh relax you see those

821
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,699
thin leaves you know it's going to make

822
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,699
you go rude if you're all excited

823
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,038
yeah and so that was that's super strong

824
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,659
and the whole the whole Indica sativa

825
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,058
thing is actually like

826
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,860
um it's actually outdated now uh yeah

827
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:30,480
because it was like it was misclassified

828
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:34,379
to begin with

829
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,079
um I just think it's so used currently I

830
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,539
don't see us I don't see us like

831
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:42,119
changing it anytime soon

832
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:44,099
no unfortunately not as much as people

833
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,599
are gonna push and try it's gonna take a

834
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,759
long time to pick because according to

835
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,879
like raw science right now

836
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:55,440
what we would consider sativa they would

837
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,880
call Indica yes from India yeah and what

838
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,000
we call indica

839
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,580
they would call afghanika

840
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,980
from Afghanistan and Pakistan region

841
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:07,259
they would call it afghanika right and

842
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,519
then what we would call what you know

843
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:12,298
like and then what we would call

844
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,918
ruderalis they call sativa

845
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:15,359
I think you got that a little twisted up

846
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,740
but I know what you're saying I don't

847
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,000
think I have to twist it up I think

848
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,278
you're a little bit twisted up where did

849
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,339
I twist it up where's it twisted

850
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,579
um let's see uh the sativa would be what

851
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:30,538
what is it it was the sativa was hemp

852
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:32,339
Indica was all Afghans afghanika was its

853
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:34,679
own thing that was short Stout

854
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:36,240
structured afghanis

855
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,460
um the rooteroz one that doesn't really

856
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,899
change yeah something like that we'd

857
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,880
have to look it up because Matt and I

858
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:43,139
disagree so yeah no it's sweets and

859
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,700
dreams is probably the most important

860
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,820
but what we can what we can definitely

861
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,640
say is that it changed

862
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:53,278
classification wise yeah from 30 40

863
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,080
years ago to now yeah very very

864
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,480
different but that classification change

865
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:00,240
has not gotten into our common speech

866
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,720
Yes and so we basically as weed people

867
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,359
call like Indica is anything that's like

868
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,960
that's from Afghanistan Pakistan

869
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:12,598
whatever region and sativas are various

870
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,519
mostly equatorial things from around the

871
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,760
globe yeah

872
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:20,338
and that's and that's it and and but

873
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,780
that's not how they you know and so like

874
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,219
we were talking about it just the other

875
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,359
day where

876
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:30,358
um a lot of the Highland afghans

877
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,579
um or cushes from Hindu Kush are a lot

878
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,219
more thin Leaf yeah

879
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:39,059
you know where the like the Bubba type

880
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,799
stuff the more low lying Afghans from

881
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:45,539
you know like low elevation or whatever

882
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,179
uh those are a lot more wide Leaf yeah

883
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:50,338
you know it's because what is it has

884
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,858
something to do with um

885
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:57,119
the the uh

886
00:34:52,858 --> 00:35:01,139
the barometric pressure the the how the

887
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,980
leaves transpire Leaf transpiration and

888
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:05,420
um

889
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,579
there's that last one oh humidity

890
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:11,460
related to how the leaves transpire

891
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:15,358
um but they're yes so when you're when

892
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,220
you're in a colder drier uh more UV

893
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,619
environment like a like a mountain

894
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:21,539
Highland Valley yeah you want to have

895
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,300
thinner leaves because you don't want to

896
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,739
transpire too much from your pores yeah

897
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,060
and you get all the light you need

898
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:29,098
because you're higher up so the

899
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,739
atmosphere is thinner so you get more

900
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,599
light yeah and you don't need as much

901
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:35,819
you don't need as big a fan leaves to

902
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,559
catch it yeah you know where it's your

903
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,680
if you're in a humid spot or a lowland

904
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,239
spot you could have wider leads because

905
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,239
you know so but that that's there's some

906
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,699
Bro Science there where we maybe haven't

907
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,459
gotten all that figured out yeah but

908
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:54,019
there's definitely pure Afghans that

909
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,760
have some fairly thin leaves yeah

910
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,800
there's Pure pakistanis or near pure

911
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,780
pakistanis that are pure turpineline

912
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,760
which is something you usually see from

913
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,339
haste types you know yeah and they would

914
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,780
say that and and so that used to be I

915
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,299
mean that was the way like if you

916
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,579
crossed an indigo to a sativa back in

917
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,740
the day you would look at all the wide

918
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:16,079
types and be like oh these lean Afghan

919
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,939
yeah and every thin type you'd be like

920
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,579
oh that's an extreme sativa and you

921
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,220
might even judge how extreme based on

922
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,900
how tall it was and how thin the leaves

923
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:28,259
were

924
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,079
and thinking you are 100 right yeah

925
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,300
when in reality there's lanky indicates

926
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,579
yeah I remember my first experience with

927
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,920
that was a Lebanese that I got from a

928
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:40,980
collective and I thought wow it was

929
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,800
called Lebanese Kush and um it had very

930
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,260
narrow leaves it grew one big long Cola

931
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,480
but it finished in seven weeks you know

932
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,760
but it was it was very red and it had a

933
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,099
very uh narcotic effect at the same time

934
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,900
and I was very confused how this this

935
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,880
narrow Leaf thing could possibly be a

936
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,599
cush or you know what I mean like yeah

937
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,660
uh considered a an Indica of any of any

938
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,920
sort yeah interesting it's interesting

939
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:06,960
too because you think about the

940
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,740
environment of like

941
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,019
um

942
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:14,879
you know like they in uh

943
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:16,980
Afghanistan has a way wider range of

944
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,039
elevation than yeah anywhere that people

945
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,960
grow here all the way from basically sea

946
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,599
level up to like you know seven eight

947
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,519
thousand feet yeah you know and they

948
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,140
have a the Hindu Kush mountain range is

949
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,019
the second biggest mountain range next

950
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,699
to the Himalayas yeah so that's seven

951
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,559
eight thousand feet or six thousand feet

952
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,539
or whatever it's still mountain valleys

953
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,039
yeah and there's still Peaks that

954
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,320
doesn't have anything on it that go way

955
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,519
up above that and so obviously the

956
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,099
environment there is going to be way

957
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,320
different yeah someone's asking about

958
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:48,900
Asian wide Leaf varieties I know there

959
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,240
was a Chinese hiss variety or I can't a

960
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,700
camera was called the I know Ace carried

961
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,039
a Chinese Union for a while

962
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:57,838
um I I haven't seen him but I I have

963
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,639
heard that there are broadly Chinese

964
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,279
plants and that supposedly where a lot

965
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,559
of those came from so perhaps

966
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,119
perhaps I haven't experienced them yet

967
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,400
but myself

968
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,940
someone just asked to do potatoes grow

969
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,940
Underground

970
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,800
the potato that you eat does grow

971
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,300
underground but that has a big above

972
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,880
ground component

973
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,019
yeah no we I pick mine off trees I'm a

974
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,920
kind of [ __ ] potatoes you're eating

975
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:32,039
but I mean technically you know uh all

976
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:36,539
Broad Leaf uh most broadleaf is Asian

977
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:38,820
yes because uh Afghanistan Pakistan that

978
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:41,579
area of China all turkmakistan all that

979
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,740
that's all Asia yeah that's the heart of

980
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,720
Asia really

981
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:48,598
I think they're afraid to Asia proper

982
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:50,879
sure you know but I mean it's definitely

983
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,640
on the Asian continent

984
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,519
yeah right um someone asked about

985
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,679
ABC the Australian bastard cannabis uh

986
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:59,820
Fernleaf looking stuff now it's

987
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,598
classified

988
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:07,079
oddly enough uh and this is this is from

989
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,559
CSI not from my experience but

990
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:14,460
it is what most people would consider

991
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:17,279
a long flowering you know uh narrow leaf

992
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:19,800
type plant as opposed to what I mean it

993
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,440
looks short and squat and you know real

994
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,720
compact bushy but it actually is a long

995
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,880
flowering you know super to paneling

996
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,399
type plant so probably people most

997
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,619
people would uh classify that as sativa

998
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,539
or some type like that

999
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,500
yeah but it it

1000
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,139
um

1001
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,079
you know as science starts to study this

1002
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:42,420
it starts to study this stuff

1003
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,880
um we're going to learn a lot more about

1004
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,400
like how the science impacts what's

1005
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,980
important to us yeah like Matt and I

1006
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,358
danced around that so and and maybe I'm

1007
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,099
bad for bringing it up because we were

1008
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,098
going to do a whole show on it at some

1009
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:59,820
point but certainly the difference

1010
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,640
between not understanding genetics uh

1011
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,640
and not understanding real science had a

1012
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,940
massive impact when certain companies

1013
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:12,598
started offering genetic testing and

1014
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,760
Promises based on genetic testing yeah

1015
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:18,180
you know uh and promising that they

1016
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,000
could reveal familial relationships and

1017
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:22,259
they could sort of unlock this like oral

1018
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,500
history

1019
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,380
yes and provide like a factual web of

1020
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,338
interrelated and interconnectedness

1021
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,380
yeah

1022
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:34,559
and they got people to pay them and send

1023
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:38,280
them tons of of DNA for it yeah they did

1024
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:41,338
and essentially and you know and it ends

1025
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,740
up being that mostly mostly what

1026
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:46,320
everybody paid for and risked their

1027
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:50,578
genetics to send in was never on the

1028
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,619
table anyway yeah it was not uh it was

1029
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,760
totally inconsistent data as far as that

1030
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,519
goes

1031
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,280
um allegedly like you know for to use

1032
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:01,679
humans for instance yeah genetics can be

1033
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,099
like this is 100 these are my children

1034
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,319
yeah that's your grandpa yeah that's

1035
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,180
your mom we can prove it

1036
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,140
and that's kind of what we were looking

1037
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:12,480
for

1038
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:16,739
with weed like this is your first cousin

1039
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,420
yeah 100 23andMe for cannabis you know

1040
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,000
that's your great grandpa that's your

1041
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,358
great grandmother that's your mom yeah

1042
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,400
you know and we didn't understand enough

1043
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,139
of the science

1044
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,700
um to really like that you know they

1045
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:30,900
came out and they made a bunch of claims

1046
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:32,519
and everybody sent them a bunch of

1047
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,139
genetics and a bunch of money

1048
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:38,099
and at the end of the day no one got

1049
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:41,098
what they wanted yeah they did yeah you

1050
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:43,200
know unfortunately we we as humans we

1051
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:45,420
tend to think about plants like humans

1052
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,759
and we know that we can do you know

1053
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,740
genetic relational data we can find

1054
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,180
someone based on their cousin now you

1055
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,098
know like people are being put in prison

1056
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:56,159
based on this kind of data or tracked

1057
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:57,838
down old serial killers but plants and

1058
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,239
especially cannabis are much more

1059
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:03,299
complex creatures with Expressions based

1060
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,759
on environment things like this um

1061
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,740
it's a lot different and and there's

1062
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,300
they needed a lot more I guess what

1063
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,279
you'd say is they needed a longer read

1064
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,339
system than they had they had a short

1065
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,019
read system and it just wasn't accurate

1066
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,539
enough to portray the data they were

1067
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:20,338
trying to say and and to me I think it

1068
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:22,199
goes back to the Bro Science of well

1069
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:26,400
they had these these different

1070
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:28,559
categories like hemp like uh blueberry

1071
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,539
No No Blueberry was hemp if I remember

1072
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,000
correcting that him they had like OG

1073
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:35,338
kush

1074
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,739
yeah they had those different yeah skunk

1075
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:40,199
but they didn't quite say What defined

1076
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:42,659
these things into these categories but

1077
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,179
they were organized by these categories

1078
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:47,159
and people still reference those as like

1079
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:49,139
well it shows mine is obviously more OG

1080
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,819
cushion skunk than you know Etc et

1081
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:52,980
cetera because they were that's why I

1082
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,019
said 23 and me and compared it to humans

1083
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,079
because when you talk genetics for

1084
00:42:55,019 --> 00:43:00,659
plants like you know we don't understand

1085
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,280
very much so it's like you try to relate

1086
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:05,279
it to the next thing that you understand

1087
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,880
some of exactly and we're like Oh I

1088
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,040
wanna I wanna see if chem 91 is you know

1089
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,960
is it you know is it sour Diesel's

1090
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,880
grandmother like we think is this

1091
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,338
related to this are the are the are the

1092
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,280
chems all sisters are they this are they

1093
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:21,838
like you want all that stuff yeah you

1094
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,720
know and

1095
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:28,019
um you know it it uh we didn't get it

1096
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,699
yeah you know and I don't know that and

1097
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,800
you'd almost probably have to take

1098
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:35,639
somebody who was an expert in that

1099
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,818
relative field yes who had our back and

1100
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,799
our interests at heart to tell us

1101
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:43,559
whether or not the mythology the the

1102
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,240
methods that they're using and what they

1103
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,639
would need to give us the answers we're

1104
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:50,358
looking for what what it ended up taking

1105
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:53,338
was someone that

1106
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:55,679
was super precise with their catalog

1107
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:58,019
that probably has more history and

1108
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,059
knowledge with their own catalog than is

1109
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:02,699
more resourceful and sourcing and more

1110
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,400
anal about sourcing to then Supply

1111
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:07,439
parent child grandchildren and then

1112
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,519
backwards test it and see if they were

1113
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,679
able to

1114
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,679
meet up that way yeah I mean I didn't

1115
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,059
even break up spending a lot of money I

1116
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,739
didn't even bring up the fact that like

1117
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:19,500
you get multiple different cuts that

1118
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,179
come in all with the same name yeah um I

1119
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,619
was just more talking about like the Bro

1120
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:25,259
Science of like we have all these

1121
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,539
stories of how things are related yeah

1122
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,119
right like for instance you know like

1123
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:31,619
the supposed like the old Betsy and and

1124
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,180
the bull rider from down there in your

1125
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:38,940
neck of the woods are supposedly sisters

1126
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:42,659
yeah right yes we don't have proof no

1127
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:46,079
just Stories the stories yeah you know

1128
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:48,179
so like we have all these stories and so

1129
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,940
basically it's like it's like we're

1130
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:53,399
gonna have this like huge industry where

1131
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,380
you don't have Decades of science behind

1132
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,039
organizing all this [ __ ] the way you

1133
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,480
would any other Big Value crop yeah it's

1134
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,338
all coming out of the woodwork and it's

1135
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,318
a huge [ __ ] mess and there's a bunch

1136
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,779
of liars and a bunch of hucksters and a

1137
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,239
bunch of deceitful ass fools trying to

1138
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,000
lay claim to Old seeds and it's like so

1139
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,338
somebody gets took on some seven early

1140
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,260
70s Colombian gold

1141
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,279
yeah pure from my uncle or whatever

1142
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,339
right

1143
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,440
yep and then that that gets entered into

1144
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:24,900
something so how do you even know what's

1145
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,639
real to start your basis point

1146
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,039
well that's that's like when I first

1147
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,259
talked to philos and um I talked to him

1148
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,059
I told him and I said you you need you

1149
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,220
need to consult with someone and much

1150
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:37,799
better than even myself who has a better

1151
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:39,480
collection and understands cannabis

1152
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,039
provenance better than anyone else in

1153
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,199
the scene if you do not hire them and

1154
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,519
keep them on staff there is no point in

1155
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,299
even doing this because you have to

1156
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:50,159
start with good uh bass genetics to be

1157
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,440
able to develop this system you have to

1158
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,598
have a reliable source for skunk one a

1159
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,119
reliable source for uh Northern Lights

1160
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,180
spy a reliable source for haze you have

1161
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,980
to have all that a reliable source for

1162
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:03,960
sfeog all the different OG cuts and

1163
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,300
without all that reliable source

1164
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,460
everything else is [ __ ] because you

1165
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,680
can't crowdsource cannabis because most

1166
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,940
of the time the the most faint cut Rises

1167
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,219
to the top

1168
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,659
yeah I mean certainly they would have a

1169
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:17,759
heart and they they wouldn't be able to

1170
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:19,078
tell anyway so that you would have this

1171
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,060
thing where it would be like well these

1172
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:22,500
five cuts of chemd say they're this but

1173
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:24,299
then there's these other weird ones that

1174
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,380
got sent in and say that

1175
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,960
yeah

1176
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,818
and how how would someone know

1177
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,858
they would have to hire someone and

1178
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:33,960
that's what they were all too lazy to do

1179
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:35,400
they were too cheap and too lazy and

1180
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,659
until the company actually does that

1181
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,760
they're going to get nowhere and every

1182
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,318
company that tries it is going to spin

1183
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,160
their [ __ ] Wheels because that's how

1184
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,239
cannabis is as a bro uh I don't know

1185
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,358
enough about

1186
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:51,239
cannabis and plant genetics to know what

1187
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,380
the framework would be to even get what

1188
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:54,539
we're after

1189
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,338
yeah I have no clue I don't know what

1190
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:59,400
that would be at all like I'm I'm not

1191
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:01,679
qualified you know what I'm saying to

1192
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,838
like judge I would have to we would have

1193
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,000
to find somebody that was into that

1194
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,279
that knew enough that wasn't going to

1195
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,780
[ __ ] us they could look at their

1196
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,880
methods and their this and their that

1197
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,920
and figure out you know because I would

1198
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,960
assume like with humans they figured out

1199
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,318
what the Swedish gene pool was like by

1200
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,639
testing a bunch of swedes yeah yeah you

1201
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:22,739
know and they were able to go around the

1202
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,420
different human populations and they got

1203
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,618
enough data that they were able to see

1204
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,599
differences

1205
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:30,000
yeah but I don't know because I'm not a

1206
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,400
geneticist I think I think because the

1207
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,559
human genome was so thoroughly mapped

1208
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,019
and I don't believe the Cannabis genome

1209
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,420
was thoroughly mapped yet or maybe it's

1210
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:42,420
just too expensive to run these type of

1211
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,400
tests at the moment it could be that

1212
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,440
so you know there's an aspect where it's

1213
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,180
like we have all these oral tales about

1214
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,579
how things are related

1215
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,019
yeah and we have no way of discerning if

1216
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,060
they're actually true

1217
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,559
uh and every time it's been promised so

1218
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:57,000
far it's been cheating

1219
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,460
yeah

1220
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,739
yeah yeah you know it's it's it's been

1221
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,900
very upsetting and disappointing all of

1222
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:05,939
the above and I think I think what most

1223
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,400
people don't know is that like

1224
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,619
um philos did or uh shut down their

1225
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,500
genetic testing they are no longer

1226
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,838
taking in tests supposedly to do genetic

1227
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,420
testing currently the database if I'm

1228
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,858
correct is still up so if anybody feels

1229
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,440
the need back it up because it may not

1230
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:24,659
always be up and uh some of these people

1231
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,059
who you know paid for these tests might

1232
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:30,299
want that data someday and what's risky

1233
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:32,219
about it is I we I was just having a uh

1234
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,800
a different convo

1235
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:36,659
um but you know like

1236
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,060
now that we're getting into science and

1237
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:41,338
now that we're getting into legal stuff

1238
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,659
um a lot of the science behind it and a

1239
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:44,759
lot of this testing and a lot of this

1240
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,159
other stuff people are nervous because

1241
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,700
they're worried that it could be used to

1242
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:52,259
you know lock access to stuff yeah like

1243
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:55,078
you get the genetic code for something

1244
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:57,300
and you lay claim to it yeah you know or

1245
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,400
you use it or you know like philos had a

1246
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,740
whole like you know backhand aspect of

1247
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,200
what they were trying to do yeah and so

1248
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,759
a lot of science you know science isn't

1249
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,399
just sitting there waiting or it's you

1250
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,500
know science is done by humans yeah and

1251
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,059
those humans can have like a variety of

1252
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,739
goals yeah so like for weed nerds you're

1253
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:18,719
all just trying to get some like raw

1254
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:21,000
science to like answer questions and

1255
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,519
figure out stuff you want to know you

1256
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,619
know so one thing

1257
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,380
Bro Science that's going on right now

1258
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:32,818
that Matt can speak of extensively okay

1259
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:35,880
is that most reversal stuff is very bro

1260
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:40,559
yes in the sense that there's not hard

1261
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:42,059
data on what to do and you know Matt and

1262
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,940
Caleb and other friends that do that

1263
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:46,440
[ __ ] went really extensively

1264
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,800
um there's certain strains where it's

1265
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,338
it's very likely that a certain amount

1266
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:56,160
of of spray yeah is very effective and

1267
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:59,000
too much or too little is not yes and it

1268
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,739
can vary by strength it can vary by

1269
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,960
clone of strain it can you could have

1270
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:05,639
two clones one inch from each other and

1271
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,760
give completely different reactions to

1272
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,920
the same exact amount of spray it is it

1273
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,020
is the data is so incomplete and I think

1274
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,000
the most data is coming between you know

1275
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:16,980
guys like me and Caleb or whoever else

1276
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,838
talking and putting together our notes

1277
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,240
what have you seen what was the what was

1278
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:22,739
the ppms of the spray what kind of spray

1279
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:24,959
were you using what was the con you know

1280
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,699
what was the constituents of the spray

1281
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,440
um how often were you spraying was it a

1282
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:30,299
trigger or did you you know there's all

1283
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:33,720
kinds of things that go into it and and

1284
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,099
as of right now because controls are

1285
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:36,659
never going to be that good until you

1286
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,859
have a you know a multi-million dollar

1287
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,379
facility

1288
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:42,480
until that's going on and the trials are

1289
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,680
being done in places like that I think

1290
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,980
we're going to be keep spinning our

1291
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:49,139
wheels so yeah so the majority of the of

1292
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,599
the seed Market right now is feminized

1293
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:53,578
at least the American one and it's very

1294
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,180
Bro Science and that it's observational

1295
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:59,280
stuff past amongst friends or maybe some

1296
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,139
tutorials that you can read on what to

1297
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,599
mix and what to use and so on and so

1298
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:06,058
forth yeah but there's a there's

1299
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,740
obviously like and there's even stuff

1300
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:09,420
that you know Caleb or Matt has shared

1301
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:10,739
with me where it's like here's this

1302
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,380
plant doesn't matter which one but

1303
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:15,838
here's a plant and I've sprayed four

1304
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,720
different types of reversal mix on it

1305
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:21,480
yeah and this one is the only one that

1306
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,618
worked yeah right the other all the

1307
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,199
others failed

1308
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:26,880
but then you use that same spray on on

1309
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,919
some other strains and it doesn't work

1310
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,220
nearly as well as the ones that failed

1311
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,920
on the that plant yeah

1312
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:37,679
so there's like a big there's probably

1313
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,500
in my mind there's like a vast amount of

1314
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,879
knowledge to figure that out yeah the

1315
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,338
one thing that we're finding that's

1316
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,579
holding true is that

1317
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:51,000
each different type of spray is as

1318
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:52,800
inconsistent as the other meaning some

1319
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,679
that are let's say someone uses

1320
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,380
colloidal silver someone uses uh silver

1321
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,598
thiosulfate someone uses

1322
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,720
um cobalt chloride

1323
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,400
each one is going to be like uh the

1324
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,039
Cobalt 4 and stuff might be better with

1325
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,780
like TK you know but it's not always

1326
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:12,480
going to be that consistent it's not

1327
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,819
always going to be effective and each

1328
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,219
one each different type of spray is just

1329
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:18,779
as inconsistent as the next because

1330
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:20,939
there are so many different Expressions

1331
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,819
it's really really [ __ ] hard to

1332
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,280
explain and and you just can't quantify

1333
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:28,259
it yet we cannot quantify it yet because

1334
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,900
for the most part with some rare

1335
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,900
exceptions in normal breeding you can

1336
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,818
have a few males and you can get an

1337
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:39,300
incredibly dense amount of pollination

1338
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:42,179
and seeds but you know off off of a off

1339
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,880
of you know a project making regular

1340
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:46,558
seeds is a vacation making regular seeds

1341
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,160
you don't really need that many males

1342
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,500
depending on how big it is and getting

1343
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,299
of getting a vigorous and thorough

1344
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,338
pollination with with a few simple

1345
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,920
tricks is quite yes

1346
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:00,358
literally reversals are like going into

1347
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,180
the casino

1348
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:04,440
with a bunch of tips and ideas on how to

1349
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,299
beat the house

1350
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,000
and you're hoping that you come out

1351
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,940
ahead that time and every time the the

1352
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,039
best advice I give everyone is numbers

1353
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:15,900
the more numbers you have the more of a

1354
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,179
chance you have of being successful that

1355
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:21,539
round and if you can't afford to to lose

1356
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:23,879
then I you know keep a lot of male

1357
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:25,739
plants clones of them or keep a lot of

1358
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,800
clones at the same plant reversing do

1359
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:31,318
several if you can't afford to uh Miss

1360
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,619
so yeah I mean there's there's not there

1361
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:36,779
that that that whole area is ripe for a

1362
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:39,480
bunch of and the problem is is there's

1363
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:42,119
no there's no direct money in it right

1364
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:45,240
now for that kind of experimentation to

1365
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:48,420
go on to really open unlock that side of

1366
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:51,239
it so it's just interested breeders

1367
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:54,420
sharing knowledge and yes

1368
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:55,739
yeah and every breeder that's the thing

1369
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,619
you should realize about all these

1370
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,358
whenever you buy feminized seed

1371
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:03,180
um you know I always talk about how like

1372
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,639
you know breeding is a lot of failure

1373
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:07,318
and mostly what I mean

1374
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,818
is that it doesn't give you the results

1375
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:11,039
and the children that you were hoping

1376
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:14,099
for all the time that's mostly what I

1377
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:17,099
mean but what's also true is that

1378
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:21,059
there's a lot of failure in uh reversals

1379
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:24,420
it's it's expensive total failure

1380
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:27,300
um you know very very light pollination

1381
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,039
uh you know all that and and so you know

1382
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,140
in addition to the failure of just

1383
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,318
normal breeding there's you know the

1384
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:36,358
failure to make seed yeah the and and

1385
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,279
the main problem like for people that

1386
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,098
are wondering what the issue is when we

1387
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,260
say a failure what's going on almost

1388
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:45,480
every time

1389
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:48,119
when I did the the 13 000 plant reversal

1390
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,159
I saw three plants in 13 000 that didn't

1391
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,019
reverse at all they had no male parts

1392
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,899
that stayed all female and didn't take

1393
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:56,759
any kind of hormonal treatment that's

1394
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,740
three and thirteen thousand that's very

1395
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,119
that's so rare to even be able to

1396
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:02,039
observe that

1397
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,019
um most of the time what you'll see is a

1398
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:06,000
plant a female or a female plant you're

1399
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,920
reversing will start to form male parts

1400
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,199
after about three and a half four weeks

1401
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,539
but the parts will instead of like on

1402
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:15,118
most males world the balls will hang as

1403
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,699
they mature on on a female plant when

1404
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,760
you reverse it the balls cluster hard as

1405
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:23,818
if they were a female bud and whatever

1406
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:26,579
happens in this action is where it

1407
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:28,920
doesn't allow the the uh male parts to

1408
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,240
mature it just doesn't allow them to

1409
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:34,559
mature because it's they're all

1410
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:36,539
clustered so hard and we don't know what

1411
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,640
exactly causes that clustering there's a

1412
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:40,318
few tips and tricks like where you can

1413
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,358
use jabrylic acid and spray it really

1414
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,460
lightly and hope that you know if the

1415
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,880
the anthers and everything expand a

1416
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:49,019
little bit and cause a little bit

1417
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,660
I'll give it a little bit more room to

1418
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,159
mature but um yeah that's that's the

1419
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:55,318
main action most of the time you'll see

1420
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:57,299
balls not all the times while the balls

1421
00:55:55,318 --> 00:56:00,539
open and drop or mature yeah because

1422
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,579
there's like there's an open drop on a

1423
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:04,980
male and then all this pollen comes out

1424
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:08,099
but it's like if they're all stacked

1425
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,260
Every Which Way tight yeah then they can

1426
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,180
then they don't open and so sometimes

1427
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,000
there's pollen in there and our friends

1428
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:17,699
have had success manually removing that

1429
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,739
pollen get tweezers you pull it out and

1430
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:22,139
you shake it out in a little bag one by

1431
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:24,358
one and that's that we consider that a

1432
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:27,000
failure if you have to do that you know

1433
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:28,980
right or or using using various kinds of

1434
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,079
Master screens or different things and

1435
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:33,119
trying to get the pollen separated from

1436
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,740
the rest of the flower because you don't

1437
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,838
want to fail even more than you've

1438
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:38,159
already failed exactly so you're trying

1439
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:39,779
to get at least even if it's not a

1440
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,019
sellable amount of seed you're like well

1441
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:45,240
I at least want some that I can like run

1442
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:46,858
yes and test and give to my friends and

1443
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:48,838
see what's in it because I want to see

1444
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,639
what's in it yeah you know but there's a

1445
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:53,159
lot of manual pollination that goes on

1446
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,480
with with reversals simply because it's

1447
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,420
all Bro Science

1448
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,699
yeah and I mean I Matt can speak to this

1449
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:02,159
more than I can but I mean when

1450
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:04,500
reversals first started happening

1451
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:07,618
when was the first time that like a

1452
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,480
tutorial got posted on one of the forums

1453
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:11,338
because it was pretty tightly held

1454
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,780
information for a minute

1455
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:14,578
um I can't remember the dude's name and

1456
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:18,180
I really wish I did because he deserves

1457
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:20,220
credit but the dude um I know fat later

1458
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:22,919
posted it on from Spice Brothers

1459
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:25,858
um posted it on overgrow and it was a

1460
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,099
basic tutorial on how to make spray that

1461
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:33,119
will be effective it was the 2.5 or 0.5

1462
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:36,119
2.5 I think it was combo of silver

1463
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:39,420
nitrate and sodium thiosulfate uh mixed

1464
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:42,358
at you know 500 milliliters a piece you

1465
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,760
mix it in and then nine to one on

1466
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:47,039
um

1467
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,859
on the the ratio dilution rate and that

1468
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,119
became where most people started and you

1469
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:54,119
know some people took it further from

1470
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,920
there and worked more uh on the ratio to

1471
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:57,900
perfect it for certain types of strains

1472
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,280
and strains are more popular now and

1473
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,960
some people stuck with that and still

1474
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,660
use that to this day and and have

1475
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,519
effective success

1476
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:06,960
yeah I mean we we had we have some

1477
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,059
friends that have some funny stories

1478
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,179
that like [ __ ] up the dilution ratios

1479
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:15,300
early on and sprayed like way too strong

1480
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:17,699
of a solution and like half killed the

1481
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,980
plant oh yeah burned it up but then it

1482
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:21,719
reversed really well yeah you know a

1483
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,940
bunch of leaves died it looked all

1484
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:27,058
Haggard and heinous and all that you

1485
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:28,619
know so I mean there's a there's an

1486
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:31,559
aspect and then it's there's this thing

1487
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:34,380
too where like the scientific method is

1488
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,540
like you do an experiment and then you

1489
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,760
get results and then other people are

1490
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:40,858
able to replicate that

1491
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,599
over and over and over again and if

1492
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:45,900
enough people do that well now you've

1493
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:47,160
got some accepted science right yeah the

1494
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,619
problem with s the problem with

1495
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,539
reversals is someone does something they

1496
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:53,338
write it all down they document just

1497
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:54,960
exactly how they did it and then

1498
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:56,519
somebody else does that same thing with

1499
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,619
the same plants and they fail or it

1500
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:00,960
doesn't go that very well yeah

1501
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:03,420
and so the replication part we haven't

1502
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,199
even gotten to that this is how you do

1503
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,358
it

1504
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,679
yeah these are the these are the factors

1505
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:10,558
these are the things you take into

1506
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,058
account to dial it in yeah it's hoping

1507
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,980
in guesswork

1508
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:16,740
yeah you know and Matt would even do a

1509
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,119
thing he would tell me that sometimes he

1510
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:21,118
would reverse three or four different

1511
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,039
strains yeah always have backups and

1512
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,660
backups and backups because he he won

1513
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,239
you know he was interested in breeding

1514
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:29,159
with all of them yeah and whichever one

1515
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:31,078
reversed the best

1516
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:33,000
yeah was gonna be the males that was

1517
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,160
used and that that obliterated some

1518
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,519
failure yeah you know because you're

1519
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:40,500
trying to mitigate failure yeah you know

1520
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:42,539
and that's and I don't know that that

1521
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,579
that that like observational Bro Science

1522
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:47,460
isn't changing anytime soon because I

1523
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:49,559
don't know when like corporate paid for

1524
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:53,159
science is going to get to

1525
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,960
looking at reversals and doing a bunch

1526
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,639
of

1527
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:59,099
non-profitable work to figure out how it

1528
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,838
works and to leave the info open source

1529
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:02,760
after that yeah it's not very likely

1530
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:05,400
yeah and to not just sit on that

1531
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,339
proprietary style yeah because they

1532
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,160
figured it out yeah you know

1533
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,960
um and so how so that that aspect of

1534
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:15,960
things so there's all this stuff where

1535
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,119
like real science could help us

1536
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,159
but how do we as grungy weed people

1537
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,858
access it

1538
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,838
you know something going on right now

1539
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:26,039
maybe we could talk about that too where

1540
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:29,400
it's like

1541
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:31,380
I mean I wasn't worried about disease at

1542
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:35,519
all in the 90s

1543
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:38,220
yeah you know and now viroids and

1544
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:42,000
dudding and pathogens

1545
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:44,219
have become a massive issue yeah and by

1546
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,298
the time we had testing for him

1547
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:47,298
they were everywhere

1548
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:52,318
right now right like I got people

1549
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,420
texting me all the time about thyroids

1550
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:56,338
yeah there's all kinds of posts it's in

1551
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,780
all kinds of you know it's like it's

1552
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:00,239
going to get to a point probably in the

1553
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,980
legal Market where when you buy clones

1554
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:05,939
they're gonna have to have viroid free

1555
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:08,400
tests yeah I mean I just heard that some

1556
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:10,318
little uh Raton brought a bunch of

1557
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,818
clones over to Barcelona and ruined a

1558
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:15,298
bunch of

1559
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:17,039
uh uh libraries serious libraries that

1560
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:20,159
were keeping old strains that European

1561
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,719
strains uh because uh you know people

1562
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,719
people over there are trying to import

1563
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,578
our shitty gelato with [ __ ] hplv and

1564
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,259
that's what happens yeah I mean I'm to

1565
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:30,119
the point now I buy one of those like

1566
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,859
100 pack of razors

1567
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,440
yeah and if I'm taking cuttings or

1568
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:37,318
something it's a new it's a new razor

1569
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,240
every plant yeah they take a lot more

1570
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:42,358
precautions I used to just use a razor

1571
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:43,679
until it got dull yeah take two 300

1572
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:45,179
cuttings with it and then it stopped

1573
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,440
cutting quite as well and I'd pop a new

1574
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:48,118
one

1575
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,139
um it this this goes back to what we

1576
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,940
were talking about the Bro Science

1577
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,019
someone just asked if reversals were

1578
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,000
normal

1579
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:56,280
um back in the day when I would you know

1580
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,039
debate people about it I would point out

1581
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,599
really quickly that actually we we as

1582
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,519
humans have tried to breed out the

1583
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,039
intersex trait and the intersex trait is

1584
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,380
actually standard in cannabis so

1585
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,558
technically reversals are bringing it

1586
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,180
back to where it was and more natural

1587
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,859
than what we have done by humans

1588
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:16,019
breeding intersect traits out of the

1589
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:17,400
plant so yeah because I mean that was

1590
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:19,019
the big thing was like people oh you're

1591
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,460
doing something so unnatural to the

1592
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:22,079
plant yeah you're ruining it you're

1593
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,099
ruining it because it's unnatural and I

1594
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,339
would always point out you know actually

1595
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,380
we're moving it back from to more

1596
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:30,960
natural and intercepts yes we touched on

1597
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,700
that with like the the Hermes you start

1598
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,318
with Hermes seeds you're ruining the

1599
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:35,879
lime yeah but there was a lot of

1600
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:37,798
prejudice because people thought that

1601
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,380
they you were permanently altering the

1602
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:43,500
Cannabis Gene the jeans yes by doing

1603
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:45,358
this cheating thing and I've mentioned

1604
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,318
it before on previous podcasts but up

1605
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:51,739
until the the late 80s early 90s

1606
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:55,920
seedless Weed really wasn't very popular

1607
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:58,379
so all weed was seeded yeah you know so

1608
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,059
if a plant had a bunch of hermaphrodites

1609
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,920
oh well there was a bunch of males

1610
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:04,380
anyway yeah

1611
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,298
you know all that tie all that this all

1612
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,298
that hash stuff they didn't care as much

1613
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:10,858
if it got you know like it there there

1614
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:12,838
was just Herms weren't that big of a

1615
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:13,920
deal a few seeds here and there yeah

1616
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:15,239
they were just gonna beat the [ __ ] out

1617
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,380
of it anyway they're gonna beat the [ __ ]

1618
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:18,419
out of it anyway they're gonna turn it

1619
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,400
into hash and then all the smoking

1620
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,500
cultures the Colombian the Panamanian

1621
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,200
the Jamaican and all that most of that

1622
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,599
came chock full of seeds the Mexican

1623
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:30,358
yeah so a few more seeds from herbs

1624
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,559
how's it any different yeah it was it

1625
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:32,818
was when we started trying to grow

1626
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,619
seedless

1627
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:36,659
that we were like hey there's this

1628
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:38,760
built-in trait to cannabis that we don't

1629
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:40,798
like what the [ __ ] is it doing here yeah

1630
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,799
yeah why as a breeder do you allow this

1631
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,838
to exist and and threaten my room of

1632
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:48,179
pure you know because it's like the most

1633
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,039
unnatural thing in the world is what we

1634
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:53,219
do to cannabis

1635
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:56,039
yes if we grow it for flour yeah we're

1636
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:58,078
denying it what it wants to do

1637
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:01,858
I forgot this I don't know if I showed

1638
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,359
you this is the LA Kush triangle oh yeah

1639
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:05,759
it looks like it's got some triangle

1640
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,380
density yeah it's very strong but it

1641
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,520
actually smells exactly like [ __ ]

1642
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,519
sour

1643
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:12,798
sorry interesting I just got sidetracked

1644
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:17,400
people

1645
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:20,099
so you do get regular males on reversals

1646
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,099
somebody just asked that technically yes

1647
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:24,900
but I don't think they test mail like if

1648
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:27,240
you were to sex test them they would sex

1649
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,220
test female they are just expressing

1650
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,739
mail so I don't need to understand the

1651
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:34,739
difference between I was pressing and

1652
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:39,179
and genotype I'll put it this way okay

1653
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:41,219
so I I did a like a 13 000 seed pop of

1654
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:43,618
of CSI work which you're familiar with

1655
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:45,899
right yeah and out of that we probably

1656
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,519
got out of that 13 000 seeds we probably

1657
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,240
got about

1658
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:53,579
I don't know 80 to 100

1659
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:55,739
observational full males yes

1660
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:58,318
no female flowers

1661
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:00,539
full pollen not hermaphrodite not

1662
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:02,338
hermaphrodites where they had both yeah

1663
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:04,619
but for them but for the most part full

1664
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:06,058
balls full everything yeah

1665
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:08,039
you know

1666
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:10,200
um and so you know that's obviously not

1667
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:12,000
that many out of out of that many seeds

1668
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:14,039
yeah

1669
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,960
um but you know we're we're playing a

1670
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:17,639
little Dr Frankenstein with with plants

1671
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,059
where it's like they just wanna

1672
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:22,379
you know they're not they're they're

1673
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:23,700
breeding isn't to provide us with what

1674
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,500
we want

1675
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,480
they're trying to make seed for the next

1676
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:29,639
generation and do their thing

1677
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,679
and and someone said no they would not

1678
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:33,779
test mail they would test female that's

1679
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:36,779
that's observationally what we've seen

1680
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:38,880
so far anyways yeah I mean we know that

1681
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:41,280
so you know a certain percentage and

1682
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,099
then you know it's not so much the to us

1683
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,500
it's not so much the method you use it's

1684
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,818
more that does the plant have it in its

1685
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,940
genes or not

1686
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:52,739
yeah because one of the reasons why for

1687
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:55,318
instance you guys don't see a bunch of

1688
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:58,679
diesel s1s on the market is because

1689
01:05:55,318 --> 01:06:00,599
diesel is famously hard to reverse yes

1690
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:03,000
there's some things with odd it's

1691
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:06,359
there's some things that harm but almost

1692
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,858
never will successfully reverse yeah

1693
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:09,719
and there's some things that reverse

1694
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:11,699
like a champ

1695
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,519
yeah you know and there's some things

1696
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:16,379
that reliably reverse nine times out of

1697
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:18,659
ten and then one of those times it won't

1698
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,539
drop any pollen and you'll [ __ ] smash

1699
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:24,179
your balls in a drawer

1700
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:25,139
that 13 000 seed hunt was in Southern

1701
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:28,739
California

1702
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,779
yeah I mean we did we did a 13 000 um

1703
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:33,058
plant reversal and made a few million

1704
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:36,480
seeds but like hunting 13 000 seats

1705
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:38,700
isn't that common no it's it's a luxury

1706
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,920
for someone to be able to do it was one

1707
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:43,019
of the I I was I was helping on one of

1708
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,700
the bigger farms in Southern California

1709
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:46,318
at the time

1710
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:49,919
um but there is there is an explosion

1711
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:52,440
now of 80 acre 40 acre 25 acres you know

1712
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,740
this that everything else those 13 000

1713
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:58,440
plants they took up about seven acres

1714
01:06:54,739 --> 01:07:01,199
but there's also the factor uh and I you

1715
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,059
know I saw this with uh the the seed pop

1716
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:06,960
at the at the hemp place and everywhere

1717
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:08,160
else testing is a [ __ ] when you do 13

1718
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,780
000 plants because someone's got to

1719
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,118
smoke it all if you're gonna do a pheno

1720
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,859
hunt it was too many yeah it was too

1721
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:15,539
many it wasn't it wasn't there was a lot

1722
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:17,519
of non-ideal things about that

1723
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:19,260
particular project for sure but people

1724
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,480
get excited and money does what money

1725
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:23,579
wants to do yeah

1726
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,980
um and so yeah I mean even even growing

1727
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:28,619
out three or four hundred plants yeah

1728
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:30,420
and trying to objectively test the smoke

1729
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:33,780
yeah

1730
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:35,400
it's it's it's uh it's rough yeah very

1731
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,260
you know at some point you're you're

1732
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,858
gonna you're gonna start missing things

1733
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:42,240
yeah or you know as as uh as Caleb likes

1734
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:45,058
to say just look for the runtiest

1735
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,279
shittiest most nastiest production plant

1736
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:48,720
you've ever seen and let your smokers

1737
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,660
try that one and that'll be the clear

1738
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,939
top five yeah yeah the one that you're

1739
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:56,519
hoping doesn't taste and smell and smoke

1740
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,318
like it actually does yeah and then all

1741
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:59,699
the beastly production plants they'll be

1742
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:01,679
like meh

1743
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:04,019
okay you know what someone just brought

1744
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,818
in something good so we'll jump on it uh

1745
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:08,519
did you guys cover Bro Science of male

1746
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:09,960
selection and I I don't we haven't I

1747
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:11,400
don't know not yet not at all we haven't

1748
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,220
talked there's a bunch of Bro Science

1749
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,039
with mail selection yes the number one

1750
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:19,259
thing that I am asked as a seed maker is

1751
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,198
what do you look for in your males bro

1752
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:24,179
like and that's the assumption that I

1753
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,798
only look for certain traits in males

1754
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:29,460
and if they have those traits then I use

1755
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:31,439
them which is a thousand percent how I

1756
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:34,560
don't do things

1757
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,599
um I usually start with a an idea

1758
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,020
um an end goal like I want a plant

1759
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:42,179
that's going to be let's say strawberry

1760
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:44,940
and have pretty dense structure and kind

1761
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:46,500
of shortened Squat and from there I will

1762
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:49,379
think of different lines where I can

1763
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,238
achieve that and then select a male that

1764
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:53,039
has the traits that I want and same with

1765
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:56,000
the female and that's how each project

1766
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:58,560
is done and achieved

1767
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,319
so different different male for

1768
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:04,140
different female for different purposes

1769
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,819
you know some Bro Science that I would

1770
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,699
classify that I don't know has been

1771
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:11,279
scientifically proven

1772
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:12,238
is if it showed flowers in veg you Chuck

1773
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,040
it

1774
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,259
yeah

1775
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:18,420
you know sometimes people would even

1776
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:19,920
torture like this is some Bro Science

1777
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,960
where you'd be like I'm gonna torture

1778
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,060
this male yeah I'm Gonna Keep a cutting

1779
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,920
of it I'm gonna grow it way too big in a

1780
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:28,319
Solo Cup I'm going to let it drought

1781
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,539
three or four times I'm gonna beat it up

1782
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,298
I'm gonna do weird [ __ ] to it is it

1783
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:36,359
stable yeah yeah yeah the the the

1784
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:37,859
testing males aspect was was a big

1785
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:40,079
popular thing people used to say on the

1786
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:42,179
forums I'm gonna I'm gonna stress test

1787
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:43,798
my [ __ ] males I'm gonna stress test

1788
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:45,838
these females and see what we can do to

1789
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:47,579
them and to me I was I always had an

1790
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,679
opposite point of view on it and I'd be

1791
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:51,000
like I don't want people to grow my

1792
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,798
plants like [ __ ] so I think where I'm

1793
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,140
like [ __ ] of course they're gonna earn

1794
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:57,600
so what's the point of that you know is

1795
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,880
stress testing males well if you throw

1796
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,579
any male in a [ __ ] tiny little cup

1797
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,460
it's gonna [ __ ] Autoflower 99 of the

1798
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:07,920
time you know there's an asset where the

1799
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,659
plant is desperate to do what it's

1800
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,119
supposed to do which is make seed and

1801
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:15,359
provide the Next Generation yeah so you

1802
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:17,819
beat the [ __ ] out of it and uh you know

1803
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:19,500
it some of them might panic and be like

1804
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:21,840
no matter what I'm gonna do what I'm

1805
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,819
supposed to do yeah

1806
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,560
uh there is actually it's interesting

1807
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,420
one of the things we should we should

1808
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,920
and this is something that we might have

1809
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,679
a friend on at some point I don't know

1810
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:35,640
but uh he goes by the handle on IG of

1811
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,679
707 seed bank yeah uh we call him Shabad

1812
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,900
um but he was one of the guys he would

1813
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,560
reverse males

1814
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:45,899
and smoke them yes because he wanted to

1815
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,960
see what the resin production and what

1816
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:50,939
the Terps were and what the smoke was

1817
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,039
like as a female plant

1818
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:54,178
yeah I would do the same thing but I

1819
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,039
wouldn't smoke them because there

1820
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:58,020
usually wasn't enough smokable content

1821
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:59,880
to make it worth it but I get an idea

1822
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,860
for for the terpene production in the

1823
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,140
mail and that way when when I ran the

1824
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:05,759
progeny from said mail I would be able

1825
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,340
to identify oh this is coming from the

1826
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,140
mail and that's why you know yeah so

1827
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,179
that was just another way of trying to

1828
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:15,119
get information because I think Matt

1829
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:17,219
calls it the shotgun method right where

1830
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,899
a lot of times you don't really know you

1831
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:21,060
have some observational things is it

1832
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:23,939
tall is it short did it flower early did

1833
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:26,520
it not does its flower custers look look

1834
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:28,019
sexy yeah and then you use that one and

1835
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,820
then you got to grow out seeds and be

1836
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,640
like did this pass the traits that I

1837
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:34,979
want yeah and you know Neville and other

1838
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,860
guys that like grew up in the era of all

1839
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:39,539
male female breeding

1840
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:42,238
um you know finding the mail was the

1841
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:44,819
biggest [ __ ] yeah finding the one that

1842
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:47,879
would consistently pass the traits that

1843
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:48,899
you want to the progeny that was the

1844
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,119
whole game

1845
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:54,299
and it's still the biggest [ __ ] in the

1846
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,920
game I think even though reversals are

1847
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,679
technically harder because of the

1848
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,779
failure rate I think that breeding Wise

1849
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:03,060
It's much easily easier to select a

1850
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:04,979
female from observable traits than it is

1851
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,199
a male knowing what observable traits

1852
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:09,359
here pass I mean we could use Neville as

1853
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,219
another example uh just because it's

1854
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,679
super famous

1855
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:17,100
um but you know when he went to jail in

1856
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:20,399
1990 one of his crew found this cut in

1857
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,679
uh nl5 Haze and skunk case you and it

1858
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,839
was like a sea of terpenolene and cat

1859
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:26,340
piss and weird [ __ ] and they found this

1860
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,020
one amazing plant

1861
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,760
and then

1862
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,580
when he when he started working at

1863
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,380
Scentsy they started breeding and he

1864
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:36,420
started trying to find different skunk

1865
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,060
Haze males that he would cross to his

1866
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:41,579
favorite nl5 Haze females to get that

1867
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,920
line yeah and that's what Jack Herrera

1868
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,658
came from yeah but he still wasn't happy

1869
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,000
with it so they worked on it for two or

1870
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:50,039
three more years with Shanti and that's

1871
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,619
what the mango Haze and the Neville's

1872
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:55,319
Haze and the and the uh Super Silver

1873
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:59,039
Haze came from yeah and the whole time

1874
01:12:55,319 --> 01:13:01,738
the the moms never changed

1875
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:03,899
the whole time consuming process was was

1876
01:13:01,738 --> 01:13:07,139
choosing four or five males and Crossing

1877
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:08,759
it separately to each female and then

1878
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,320
growing out the progeny and seeing if

1879
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,460
the progeny was worth the [ __ ] and gave

1880
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,019
it what it wanted

1881
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,000
if I remember correctly he didn't even

1882
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,800
like breeding with female hazes he

1883
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,260
thought that the magic to Haze was in

1884
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,960
the males if I remember correctly yeah

1885
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:25,020
he says that and I'm an admitted big

1886
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:29,340
Neville fan yeah but even I will say

1887
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:31,140
that uh two things one is that uh the

1888
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:34,500
males are what he ended up with

1889
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:36,900
yeah so yeah yeah yeah yeah

1890
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,640
I mean so it's good to say well this hey

1891
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:40,259
C this was the clear winner this is the

1892
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,119
one I want you to use and two only if

1893
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,679
you use emails one of the things that's

1894
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:46,619
interesting is when you're growing out

1895
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,658
some 18 or 20 or 22 weeks sativa thing

1896
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,939
right

1897
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:53,460
um collecting pollen and then

1898
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:56,519
pollinating a room of much more skunk

1899
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,960
Indica females yeah it's a lot easier

1900
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:02,699
timing

1901
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:05,880
than timing pollen drop to use a female

1902
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:08,158
you know so much of those 22 week long

1903
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,380
[ __ ] flowering seeds yeah the mature

1904
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:12,839
those 22-week long flowering seeds

1905
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:15,659
contained within the female

1906
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,760
um and uh what it sounds like to me is

1907
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:19,859
that he had some amazing females and he

1908
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,840
just lost them and didn't realize what

1909
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:25,019
he had until they were [ __ ]

1910
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:28,560
yeah perhaps you know there's I've seen

1911
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:30,480
a lot of pictures of of original Haze of

1912
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,400
of plants where people are like this is

1913
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,500
the [ __ ] one of original Haze this is

1914
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,658
the you know there's a lady named uh

1915
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,760
hazy lady and you might be able to find

1916
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:40,198
her picture still on Mr Nice she was one

1917
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,900
of the only people I saw that

1918
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:45,000
consistently grew

1919
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:46,979
depositronics age 19 uh who found Hill

1920
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,719
that consistently grew it beautifully

1921
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:51,959
and I could say it was a beautiful Haze

1922
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:53,899
grow that rarely rarely if ever did I

1923
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,239
see beautiful Haze females

1924
01:14:53,899 --> 01:14:59,219
uh so yeah and I mean there's an aspect

1925
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:02,759
there where it's like what it sounds

1926
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:05,158
like he even you know uh after four or

1927
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,020
five years of having Hayes

1928
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:09,420
sounds like Neville ended up with

1929
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:11,940
literally one living plant

1930
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,140
that he could work with in the future

1931
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:15,960
yeah

1932
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:18,239
which was Hasty yeah and that makes

1933
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,520
sense for old seeds you know you know

1934
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,500
and uh and but it sounds like if he knew

1935
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,480
what he had he probably would have kept

1936
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,880
all of them alive yeah and been more

1937
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,579
careful I would but so by the time he

1938
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,679
realized how special it was he'd [ __ ]

1939
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:33,719
it off yeah

1940
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,100
somebody wants to talk about the 56 day

1941
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:37,619
headband

1942
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:40,320
yeah if you want I can talk about the

1943
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:43,380
56th day so there's some aspects of it

1944
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:46,559
that I don't like but the the story is

1945
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:47,460
as as generally as I can as I can say is

1946
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,440
that

1947
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:52,859
it was called something else in Southern

1948
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:57,299
California and it was from it was it was

1949
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:59,759
from within that uh that uh Kush crew

1950
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:02,699
down in Southern California yeah in some

1951
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:05,039
aspect and that push cut and those

1952
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:06,479
cushes it was worth a lot of money and

1953
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,579
there was a lot of [ __ ] going around

1954
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,678
with it and something happened with that

1955
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:12,539
cut where there was some violence

1956
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,779
right

1957
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:18,960
and so somebody fled

1958
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:21,899
SoCal and came to the Bay uh with that

1959
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:26,219
cut and they didn't want to call it what

1960
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:27,899
it actually was yeah okay so they were

1961
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:29,698
trying to figure out because they wanted

1962
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:31,738
to grow it and sell it so they were

1963
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:33,599
trying to figure out like what can we do

1964
01:16:31,738 --> 01:16:35,218
so we can grow and sell this cut but

1965
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,140
it's not going to create any more heat

1966
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:38,520
that's going to follow us from down

1967
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:41,940
there because what happened down there

1968
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:44,400
was hello sketch right yeah and so they

1969
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:45,119
decided uh

1970
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,879
um

1971
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:50,340
you know uh they decided to rename it

1972
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,400
headband yeah

1973
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:55,860
you know uh and

1974
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:57,179
we I don't know for sure what it was

1975
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:58,319
called before

1976
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,899
yeah

1977
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,479
you know but it's the nicest Kush type

1978
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:05,939
plant that I know like of actual Kush

1979
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:08,939
you know or what we would consider a

1980
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:10,859
Kush type like the sfv or the or

1981
01:17:08,939 --> 01:17:14,698
anything like that you know like it's

1982
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:16,799
the most potent to me yeah and sometime

1983
01:17:14,698 --> 01:17:18,599
in the you know 405 or something like

1984
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,840
that right around there

1985
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,880
um it's slipped out in the bay yeah and

1986
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,920
that's how I got it and that's how some

1987
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,800
other people that have it have it and we

1988
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,779
called the 56 day uh there's a huge

1989
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,579
debate about when to take it

1990
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:35,279
yeah some people like to take it long

1991
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:37,140
like 10 11 weeks but a lot of people

1992
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,000
like to take it at eight or nine weeks

1993
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,960
and they feel it's like the most potent

1994
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,300
then

1995
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,939
weird that gives you the highest high

1996
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:46,920
and the the edginess and the raciness

1997
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:48,119
and the all that different types of

1998
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,560
stuff

1999
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:51,179
um so it's got some mystery you know

2000
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,159
there's some name I mean obviously like

2001
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:55,380
um there's there's the different names I

2002
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:56,819
know um I think Duke would call it the

2003
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,980
rest stop cush because that's where he

2004
01:17:56,819 --> 01:18:00,299
got it from uh there's the 50s there's

2005
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:02,698
there's some people called the murder

2006
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,440
cut and stuff like that you know some

2007
01:18:02,698 --> 01:18:07,619
people tried to

2008
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:09,719
um some people try to to push it as uh

2009
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:11,579
you know it's the original New York City

2010
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:13,140
headband which we now know is totally

2011
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:16,079
false yeah

2012
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:18,060
um but you know to me like when it comes

2013
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:20,158
down to it I would classify it as far as

2014
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:23,280
things I hold it's in the top three or

2015
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:25,859
four potency wise yeah yeah it's really

2016
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,359
really good weed and I usually pull it I

2017
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:32,759
usually pull it between eight and nine

2018
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:34,198
weeks yeah 60 days 59 days 63 days

2019
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,420
something along something along

2020
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:38,460
something along that that level you know

2021
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,440
it probably has other names other places

2022
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:43,260
there's a few people out there that

2023
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:46,619
might know the the first name you know

2024
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:47,520
yeah um but it is it's a really pure OG

2025
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:49,679
cut

2026
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,900
that's the one that I tend to use and

2027
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:54,179
all the the if I have anything marked

2028
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:55,559
headband that's 99 of the time what I'm

2029
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:57,119
using yeah because there's people

2030
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,400
wondering his homie had it for a long

2031
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:01,738
time yeah I mean now now we know that

2032
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:03,599
you know the original headband is the

2033
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:06,779
mama sour

2034
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,340
um and uh was a very diesel type fluffy

2035
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:12,059
you know

2036
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:13,380
uh Fox taily type cut yeah so these

2037
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,320
couple cuts that are floating around

2038
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:19,260
that are that are called headband

2039
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,698
um and uh you know they're not they're

2040
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,739
most most things that are called

2041
01:19:20,698 --> 01:19:25,259
headband are really great weed yeah

2042
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:27,059
really great OG's yeah but there's a few

2043
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,179
that are really really really great OG

2044
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:32,400
Kush types yeah and they're not related

2045
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:33,840
to New York which doesn't you know it

2046
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:35,519
might [ __ ] with some people's stories

2047
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:39,539
but it doesn't change how nice the cut

2048
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,760
is itself yeah it just happens to be

2049
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:43,920
um yeah it's it's different this dude's

2050
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,579
saying it's different it's not my La cut

2051
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:49,859
it's not lumpus cut it's not the 707 uh

2052
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:52,019
it's not even a headband yeah it was

2053
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:54,960
renamed headband because whatever name

2054
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,400
it had before was sketch yeah so now

2055
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:01,760
it's just called headband we called the

2056
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,759
56 mostly as an identifier yeah

2057
01:20:01,939 --> 01:20:08,039
eventually you have to you have to

2058
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:11,340
figure out some tag that allows uh that

2059
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:14,279
allows you to identify stuff yeah you

2060
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:16,679
know I mean before the internet we just

2061
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:19,019
called uh chem dog dog

2062
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:21,600
yeah we didn't need it to be a skunk VA

2063
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:23,219
cut or chem 91 or that like that's all

2064
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,960
internet names

2065
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:26,399
yeah so that people can communicate

2066
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,679
about it

2067
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:31,559
and that's the same thing with the 56

2068
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:34,739
it's a gorgeous OG Kush

2069
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:37,800
type plant it's incredibly potent super

2070
01:20:34,738 --> 01:20:40,379
flavorful it's really nice

2071
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:44,100
um it's probably the best Kush I know of

2072
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:45,539
you know and it has a mysterious origin

2073
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,100
um for someone's question is there

2074
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:48,960
somewhere you can review this if you

2075
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,820
missed the live feed yes

2076
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,640
um on the riot seeds the account I'm on

2077
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:56,039
not right so you'd cover right seeds you

2078
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,900
can go there's a little tab area where

2079
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:00,060
there's a little play button you click

2080
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:02,519
that and you can see all the videos that

2081
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:04,020
we've uploaded some people are asking if

2082

bunch of them up uh uh and then all of a

2103
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,480
sudden it it came down people already

2104
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:54,779
described the flavoring of the 56. I

2105
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,879
wouldn't say that the 56 uh has the best

2106
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:59,460
Kush flavor

2107
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,260
um but it is that kind of kush it

2108
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:03,600
doesn't have a bunch of lemon like some

2109
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:06,119
of the ones it's pretty it's got earthy

2110
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:08,940
but it's got that like

2111
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:12,238
cushy type like mouth coat type thing

2112
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,979
you know but it's got rare potency

2113
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,899
yeah I mean when I'm not kidding when I

2114
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:17,579
say it's like it's I mean there's some

2115
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:19,500
people if someone told me it was in

2116
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:22,019
their top one or two favorite Cuts as

2117
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,760
far as what it does to you yeah I

2118
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,800
wouldn't be surprised yeah I wouldn't be

2119
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,619
surprised it's it's in the top four or

2120
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,539
five things that I have it's super

2121
01:22:27,619 --> 01:22:31,920
potent it's really nice and it does this

2122
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:34,079
even though it's even though it's very

2123
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,300
cushy it's got this weird

2124
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,760
anxiety thing

2125
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,320
you know uh some people won't smoke it

2126
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,300
because it gives them massive anxiety

2127
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,340
and yeah it gets it gives me hella

2128
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,600
anxiety yeah there's people that there's

2129
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,699
like there's friends of mine they're

2130
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,560
wives and stuff like that and Matt and

2131
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:50,639
others like it gives it like tweaks them

2132
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,800
out and makes them uncomfortable it's

2133
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,480
unhappy High yeah

2134
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,980
you know doesn't do that for me it just

2135
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:57,779
gets me hella baked

2136
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:59,158
um but for some people it triggers them

2137
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:01,380
and it's not good and that's not

2138
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:03,299
important it is but you always say after

2139
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:06,359
you wake up from a nap after smoking it

2140
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:08,579
that your [ __ ] hurts and I I I don't

2141
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:11,460
know what's going on there super weird I

2142
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:14,460
mean that's The Company You Keep

2143
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,460
around

2144
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,440
Inland SoCal what can you say what can

2145
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:21,779
you say dude what can you say but it's

2146
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:24,000
one of those it's a it's it's one of my

2147
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:25,979
favorite Cuts uh it's a really nice it's

2148
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,198
a really nice plant

2149
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:30,539
um you know it's uh it's it can be a

2150
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:32,158
finicky OG I mean there's aspects where

2151
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:33,658
I uh

2152
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,759
um there is no difference between chem

2153
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:37,139
91 and and skunk VA they're the same

2154
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,480
thing they're just different monikers

2155
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:41,820
for the same cut I have what James loud

2156
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:43,339
asked me that you got the cam 91 or you

2157
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:45,840
got the skunk the egg

2158
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:48,900
you know there's more than one cut that

2159
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:51,179
floats around that is true so you know

2160
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:53,399
what you know uh there's that but but

2161
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:56,340
all those names originate from one cup

2162
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:59,279
yeah you know

2163
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:00,659
um and uh yeah and then you know so

2164
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,399
there's an aspect too where it's like

2165
01:24:00,658 --> 01:24:05,219
getting back to that

2166
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,439
real science could tell us one day what

2167
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:09,539
the 56

2168
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:10,500
and how closely it's related to other

2169
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:13,319
things

2170
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,679
yeah it could take the oral history of

2171
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:19,738
the and some of that mystery you know

2172
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:21,300
and uh and it could clear that up

2173
01:24:19,738 --> 01:24:23,099
um there is no answer to which one is

2174
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,840
better D or 91 because it's personal

2175
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,600
preference

2176
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,480
you know I would say both of them are in

2177
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,880
my all-time favorites

2178
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:34,619
um but you know uh some people I would

2179
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,579
say the opposite yeah some people don't

2180
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:37,738
like them

2181
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:39,179
you know

2182
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:41,519
um

2183
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:43,560
but you know there's there's an aspect

2184
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:47,400
where and someone asked this TK the

2185
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:50,340
original Kush I think TK is likely one

2186
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:53,279
of the original hybrids yeah the

2187
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:55,800
question is is we don't know how many we

2188
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:58,920
don't know what it is or exactly what it

2189
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,960
came from very well yeah and we think

2190
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,719
that there might have been more than one

2191
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:06,359
and we think that most cush are bag seed

2192
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:07,619
or s1s from those originals but we don't

2193
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:09,299
know exactly how many different

2194
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:11,939
Originals there were

2195
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:13,980
yeah we don't we know there's a lot of

2196
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:16,259
bad seeds and bag seeds and sisters of

2197
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:18,059
sisters you know and things of that

2198
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,039
nature and so it's hard and so that's

2199
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:21,719
another thing that that real science

2200
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:23,698
could explain to us

2201
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:26,039
perhaps one day

2202
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:28,019
you know um I actually think to be

2203
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:29,399
honest this might be controversial when

2204
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:33,239
people might get pissed at me but I

2205
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:36,420
think that uh that the the the the cush

2206
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:40,979
that Josh D and and Matt and those guys

2207
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:43,260
brought to La uh is is likely lost yeah

2208
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:44,459
and I don't mean like loss like nobody

2209
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:46,739
has it

2210
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:49,319
I mean like the chain of custody got

2211
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:51,479
[ __ ] up enough and now it's it's that

2212
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:53,880
it's really hard to prove that this

2213
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,379
specific one is guaranteed it and this

2214
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,380
person has had it

2215
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:59,880
and you know it's like it might be out

2216
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:02,279
there as sfe

2217
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,300
yeah it might be out there is 56 day

2218
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:05,099
headband

2219
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,199
yeah it might be out there as this the

2220
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:09,239
the ghost of today is not the ghost of

2221
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:11,638
yesterday

2222
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:13,738
there's multiple sfv cuts that flow it

2223
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:15,900
out there oh yeah there's so many

2224
01:26:13,738 --> 01:26:18,359
renames and so much stuff happened in LA

2225
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:20,579
and the original people lost it and got

2226
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:22,019
it back and stuff that like I think it

2227
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:25,260
might still exist but under different

2228
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:26,880
monikers well I mean and then we had

2229
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:29,340
um certain companies like Cali

2230
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:31,440
Connection they would make certain

2231
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:34,920
strain names like their seed lines would

2232
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,599
be sfeog so now a bunch of people are

2233
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:38,940
growing their seed lines and then they

2234
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:42,719
have cuts of things called SF EOG now

2235
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:44,759
there's 3 000 sfe OG Cuts all claiming

2236
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,340
to be the original you know we did it

2237
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:50,579
with Larry he did it with Tahoe he did

2238
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,319
it with several so yeah the provenance

2239
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:53,939
on those are just damn near impossible

2240
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:57,238
now to go back and there's two or three

2241
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:58,799
sfvs that are popularly traded amongst

2242
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:01,678
people and they're different

2243
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:04,139
yeah you know but there's an aspect

2244
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,520
where it's like the TK at least you have

2245
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,340
really you have some pretty good chain

2246
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,500
of custody yeah and that cornbread Ricky

2247
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:12,480
sent it but even before he moved to

2248
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,880
California sent it to some people in

2249
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,619
California yeah and then he brought it

2250
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,199
with him and it doesn't appear to have

2251
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:20,939
gotten lost by the original crew and

2252
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,198
there's still good chain of custody on

2253
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:25,379
that one

2254
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:27,119
you know the Josh cut or you know the

2255
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:28,980
the Matt bubba cut or whatever you want

2256
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:31,500
to call it like that one got a little

2257
01:27:28,979 --> 01:27:35,698
lost in the wave of the OG movement in

2258
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:37,139
SoCal yeah and so people can say the 92

2259
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:39,719
is that cut

2260
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:43,079
or the Kush cut is that cut but Kush cut

2261
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:46,139
is that cut the the ghost the real ghost

2262
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:48,539
is that cut the sfv that I have is that

2263
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:49,980
cup and then you put those four Cuts in

2264
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:51,238
the room and you grow them all out next

2265
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:53,099
to each other and they're not the same

2266
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:55,019
weed yeah

2267
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:59,039
so some of those people

2268
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:00,620
or they're the same cut brought to

2269
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,698
completely different environments

2270
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:04,439
completely you know found a whole

2271
01:28:02,698 --> 01:28:06,359
different way of expressing and now move

2272
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:08,219
back in to the same environment and they

2273
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:09,719
all Express totally differently until

2274
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:13,619
they're acclimated to that environment

2275
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:15,960
again so I mean there was so much La was

2276
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:17,698
like the perfect micro like to blow up

2277
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,658
in L.A and to be worth that much money

2278
01:28:17,698 --> 01:28:24,539
yeah and a culture that fronts so hard

2279
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:27,299
we went from like one cut showing up

2280
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:32,100
from these Florida guys yeah to like

2281
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:35,880
clubs full of only OG within 15 years

2282
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:39,500
and several dozen OG cuts at least

2283
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,500
yeah so how did that happen

2284
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:44,639
you know is is the Flow Rider that I

2285
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,020
have is that a sister to the stuff that

2286
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:49,139
Josh brought out

2287
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:51,719
is that a sister to TK is it the same as

2288
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:54,719
the original Josh is it I've grown it

2289
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:57,060
next to the real TK it's not that one

2290
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,800
is it a bag you know what I'm saying

2291
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,840
like it you just don't know but I mean

2292
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,880
but it goes back to the expression thing

2293
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,840
like maybe it is the same exact cut and

2294
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,100
they're just expressing totally

2295
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,960
differently because they've been moved

2296
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,880
to two different environments and the

2297
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,698
hard part is that that's why I do this

2298
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,440
thing I don't know if I I have a hard

2299
01:29:11,698 --> 01:29:17,158
time with acclimation

2300
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:19,079
yeah I do I like to grow things to see

2301
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:21,119
what they are side by side in the same

2302
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,979
room same environment same food same

2303
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:24,599
everything

2304
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:26,579
you know I'm not sure that taking it to

2305
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,199
Hawaii for four years does some kind of

2306
01:29:26,579 --> 01:29:29,880
genetic change

2307
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:31,799
I don't think it does a genetic change

2308
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,779
but I think expression is expression and

2309
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,760
I think that's that's that's for real

2310
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:37,439
it's just I'm not saying I'm not

2311
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,719
disagreeing with people I'm just saying

2312
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:40,919
that like I this is another aspect where

2313
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:43,800
we just don't know

2314
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,600
yeah I mean like like for the the first

2315
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,679
thing that really taught me this was

2316
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,840
cheese

2317
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:51,000
this is a clone that I had run out many

2318
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,039
times and every time I'd run it out it

2319
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,039
smelled like funky foot cheese

2320
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:58,560
get it back from a great source now I've

2321
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:01,979
got Barry and then the next time I grow

2322
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:04,260
it I've got one clone Berry one clone

2323
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:08,158
fruit next to them they look different

2324
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:10,500
and it's like is this just these little

2325
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,238
micro expressions and and you know with

2326
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,279
CSI that was one of the ones that really

2327
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:15,839
he pointed out the environmental

2328
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:18,420
expression is everything and you just

2329
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,639
can't make any kind of conclusions based

2330
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,840
on growing if you if you've gotten the

2331
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,340
same clone supposedly from two different

2332
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,539
sources you can't make any conclusions

2333
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,980
about it

2334
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:27,899
um them being the same kind or not

2335
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:29,399
because of that environmental so that's

2336
01:30:27,899 --> 01:30:31,559
what I was saying about wanting to grow

2337
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:33,539
the same plant in the same room or the

2338
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,580
same greeny or the same environment with

2339
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,439
the same food at the same time

2340
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:40,079
yeah I think I think that makes sense

2341
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:41,759
but over you know a period of a year or

2342
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,439
two I think it would take for it to

2343
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,020
reacclimate to this so that makes it

2344
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:47,819
really hard it makes it [ __ ] way hard

2345
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:49,380
and it makes it even more confusing on

2346
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:50,759
trying to make any kind of claim on

2347
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:53,039
whether something is or isn't something

2348
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,360
you know and you know but there are

2349
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,819
there are when you grow them side by

2350
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:58,738
side it's not like you have to only wait

2351
01:30:56,819 --> 01:31:00,658
on the flower

2352
01:30:58,738 --> 01:31:02,218
yeah you want to be like whoa these

2353
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:04,679
leaves are a different color

2354
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:06,658
yeah the serrations are looking are

2355
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:08,579
looking different yeah like there's

2356
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:11,460
other observational things that you can

2357
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:14,039
do you know and so I do believe like I

2358
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:18,380
actually I actually got

2359
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:22,738
um I actually got a a chem 91 cut right

2360
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:25,139
recently uh simply because uh I wanted

2361
01:31:22,738 --> 01:31:27,299
to grow it right next to mine yeah

2362
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:30,600
because they've been grown and held and

2363
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:32,579
kept separately for a long time yeah but

2364
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,380
they're the same thing they're they're

2365
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:35,639
vegging and I'm growing them next to

2366
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:38,100
each other I haven't blew them out yet

2367
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:39,480
but I'm curious is like I guarant you

2368
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:41,579
know I know for sure they're the exact

2369
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:43,259
same cut and I know who's held it and

2370
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,760
how long and the whole bit

2371
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:47,280
but they've been in completely different

2372
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,139
environments for a really long time

2373
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:50,639
the other thing I'd Wonder Too is like

2374
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:53,100
has one of them been in a place where

2375
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:55,079
they use harsh chemicals for a long time

2376
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:57,120
you know many years and stuff like that

2377
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:59,519
yeah you know you know all that stuff

2378
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,619
environment you know like I even wonder

2379
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,179
sometimes like you know sometimes you

2380
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:04,439
get you get a weak plan or you have an

2381
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:06,600
accident or something and you have to

2382
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:08,339
save a plant or you get a plant that's

2383
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,780
in bad health and you have to nurse it

2384
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,760
back for a while because it went through

2385
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:13,259
some hell or something

2386
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,420
um you know how does that change can you

2387
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,699
get it back perfectly healthy are there

2388
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:19,319
are there the same Cuts floating out

2389
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:21,119
there of the same plant that are just

2390
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:22,920
going to be younger and healthier

2391
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,359
because they didn't get the tar beat out

2392
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,219
of them

2393
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:28,439
it's hard to say

2394
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:31,619
you know I know I know I've had

2395
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:33,178
um ogkb and then I've had ogkb from a

2396
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:36,000
source that kept it super [ __ ]

2397
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:39,179
healthy with mad Elite's cut where I'd

2398
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,800
never seen it express grow as fast or or

2399
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:42,899
have the Terps that it did but it was

2400
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,940
definitely the same cut and I'm not even

2401
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:46,500
talking about perfect health just so

2402
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:48,839
people know like I'm not talking about

2403
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,520
dudding or HP you know or anything like

2404
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:52,020
that I'm just talking about two things

2405
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,940
that we know are the same that go their

2406
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:56,280
own path for a long time

2407
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:58,738
yeah which one you know it's the same

2408
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:00,000
cut but are they all of equal health

2409
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:02,218
yeah

2410
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,779
do they stack the same do they smell the

2411
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:05,760
same do they look the same was their

2412
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:07,800
drip because when it comes to me for

2413
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,199
drift people say oh genetic drift is

2414
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,539
real I don't know that it's real

2415
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:14,460
I don't think it is but I don't know

2416
01:33:12,539 --> 01:33:16,319
that it's not real well I mean we know

2417
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:18,239
what epigenetics is but I don't think we

2418
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:19,799
fully understand epigenetics and how

2419
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:22,079
they apply to cannabis very well but I

2420
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:24,239
think that's what most people refer to I

2421
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:25,319
mean I'll say for sure that my La my

2422
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,419
headband cut

2423
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:29,460
it's definitely gotten more sensitive

2424
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:32,520
inside over the years

2425
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:34,439
yeah it used you know 15 years ago the

2426
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,699
thing was an indoor Beast

2427
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:37,198
yeah

2428
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:39,119
but sometimes there's a weird thing

2429
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:41,339
where I almost wonder I almost had this

2430
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:43,738
thought of like well what if I went back

2431
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:46,079
to single-ended hortiluxes

2432
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:48,238
yeah right it just turned into a beast

2433
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,979
again and it's that we updated the

2434
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:50,939
lights and it doesn't like the new

2435
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:52,859
lights

2436
01:33:50,939 --> 01:33:54,779
yeah

2437
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:56,158
you know and you're like oh I got all

2438
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:58,380
back in the day I grew it and it looked

2439
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:59,519
like this yeah and then you change a

2440
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,960
bunch of [ __ ]

2441
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,100
and you're like oh it doesn't look like

2442
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,060
that anymore

2443
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:07,560
can't be any of the changes I made yeah

2444
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:09,179
that would be interesting to know though

2445
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,560
so yeah but then you're like some little

2446
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:11,940
guy or whatever you know so it's like

2447
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,440
where do you where do you get the Ops

2448
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:16,319
where do you get to do these different

2449
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:18,000
environmental experiments yeah and to

2450
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:19,500
see if things are the same cut or the

2451
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,859
same this or like maybe they don't like

2452
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,719
the same light yeah you know uh I did

2453
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:27,719
this thing I did this experiment where I

2454
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:30,600
grew some head stash under only ceramic

2455
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:32,698
metal halides yeah right I mentioned

2456
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:35,760
this [ __ ] before but the dog [ __ ] which

2457
01:34:32,698 --> 01:34:38,279
I normally take 12 plus weeks yeah was

2458
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,639
done in 10.

2459
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:43,380
and I cut the chem 91 down at 85 days

2460
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:46,319
and it still had white hairs all over

2461
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:48,239
the top I believe it yeah and like was

2462
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:50,340
the longest I've ever taken it I

2463
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:52,500
normally take it 68 or 70 or something

2464
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:53,760
like that but it was like a full two

2465
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,738
weeks

2466
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,239
longer than I've ever taken it and it

2467
01:34:55,738 --> 01:35:00,658
still didn't look done

2468
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:01,859
yeah and that was just Spectrum

2469
01:35:00,658 --> 01:35:04,319
that was all that was the only thing

2470
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:06,839
that was different yeah yeah same room

2471
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,880
same food same this same hose watering

2472
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:12,020
everything same organic inputs all that

2473
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:14,639
[ __ ] did some stuff not purple too

2474
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:18,000
I didn't actually have any purple stuff

2475
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:19,920
in in that in that experiment I had what

2476
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,779
I tried to do is I grew some stuff I

2477
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,658
knew really well like the headband and

2478
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:26,340
the chemd and five or six different

2479
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:28,619
things and I grew them under the lights

2480
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:31,380
I was growing the rest of the [ __ ] yeah

2481
01:35:28,619 --> 01:35:33,359
and then I grew those same strains in

2482
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:35,520
the same room but like in a corner where

2483
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,319
there was only ceramic metal halides I

2484
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,600
had set up yeah and so the only

2485
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:41,219
difference that they were getting was

2486
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,440
the spectrum of light

2487
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:44,880
that's funny you know it came out wave

2488
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:46,919
some things didn't come out very

2489
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,480
different than each other and then a few

2490
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,000
strains were like way [ __ ] different

2491
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:53,759
like I remember telling Caleb that I

2492
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,960
pulled the the [ __ ] dog [ __ ] at 10

2493
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,940
weeks

2494
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,399
yeah and he laughed at me

2495
01:35:56,939 --> 01:36:02,039
so I started sending him pics

2496
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:03,779
and being like don't you think it's done

2497
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:04,340
yeah you know

2498
01:36:03,779 --> 01:36:07,139
yeah

2499
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:09,960
am I gonna lose you again I don't know

2500
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:11,880
if you're delayed you looked weird for a

2501
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,319
second are you there testing one two

2502
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,659
three

2503
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:18,960
yeah I'm here can you hear me yeah he's

2504
01:36:15,658 --> 01:36:20,939
[ __ ] we're [ __ ] am I [ __ ] now

2505
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:22,500
or is he [ __ ] I don't know if it's me

2506
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:25,079
or you

2507
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:27,719
you're here I don't know how to tell I

2508
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:30,840
can hear you you can hear me I think

2509
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:31,679
it's me uh yeah it might be you I don't

2510
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:35,520
know

2511
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:36,658
I think it's me but yeah there's so I

2512
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,340
can think of all these different

2513
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:40,079
experiments and Matt's thinking of

2514
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:43,380
different experiments too

2515
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:45,658
right yeah but enacting all of those to

2516
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,980
eliminate variables is a time-consuming

2517
01:36:45,658 --> 01:36:49,019
money [ __ ]

2518
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:51,658
it's just the whole you're pouring [ __ ]

2519
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:54,480
into to try to learn more about a plan

2520
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:56,579
almost all of my my experiments that I

2521
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:59,698
ran over the years were all based around

2522
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:02,039
whether or reversals and whether

2523
01:36:59,698 --> 01:37:04,198
something to do with purples and plants

2524
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:06,899
uh one of the funny thing was I became

2525
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:09,658
obsessed with and convinced that metal

2526
01:37:06,899 --> 01:37:11,939
halide must be the way to to get the

2527
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:14,579
purples to express the best and much

2528
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:16,379
later on I learned that that was

2529
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:18,238
probably the most opposite and stupid

2530
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:20,819
bro science theory I could have had

2531
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:22,559
because it actually reduces the amount

2532
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:25,799
of purples you'll see and that that is

2533
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:28,380
conclusive that's inclusive so yeah you

2534
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,179
know we have and I don't think like I've

2535
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,000
you know I've been posting on my stories

2536
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:35,219
the last few days my friend did some uh

2537
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,779
grew out some of my sour you know yeah

2538
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:39,239
and I wanted people to see it and it

2539
01:37:36,779 --> 01:37:40,559
started some combos or whatever

2540
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:42,959
um and I don't really I think the

2541
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,520
Diesels are such a close family that

2542
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,980
like I don't really think that you can

2543
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:49,440
compare them unless you grow them in the

2544
01:37:46,979 --> 01:37:51,238
same room at the same time yeah or the

2545
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:52,859
same Greenhouse or the same outdoor the

2546
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:54,119
same whatever ever I don't think like

2547
01:37:52,859 --> 01:37:55,500
you were talking earlier I don't think

2548
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:57,539
you can take two totally different

2549
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,760
environments and different regimens

2550
01:37:57,539 --> 01:38:03,060
yeah and then put that in the jar and be

2551
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,920
like is this the same wheat yeah no

2552
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:06,239
you know what gives the most perp

2553
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,639
genetics

2554
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,379
yeah everything else is just trying to

2555
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:13,859
coax the genetics to do what you want

2556
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:15,480
yeah but some genetics just give it

2557
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:18,719
and it doesn't matter

2558
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:20,279
you know yep it doesn't matter but yeah

2559
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,500
even just figuring out all this stuff

2560
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,479
some of this stuff is some of this stuff

2561
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,079
is uh you know

2562
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,259
um

2563
01:38:25,079 --> 01:38:30,719
it's it's very observational you know

2564
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:32,520
getting back to philos philos thought

2565
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:35,939
every cut of [ __ ] Sour Diesel they

2566
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:38,100
sent him was the exact same cut yeah n o

2567
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:39,899
g n o g and at the time I was growing

2568
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,579
out a bunch of these diesel Cuts next to

2569
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:43,679
mine and next to the headbands and stuff

2570
01:38:41,579 --> 01:38:46,198
to try to figure [ __ ] out yeah and they

2571
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,060
were obviously different related

2572
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:49,678
but you know some had light green leaves

2573
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:51,360
some had dark green leaves some had

2574
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,940
different serrations some had different

2575
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:56,698
maturity rates exactly different yeah

2576
01:38:53,939 --> 01:39:01,500
all you all smells all kinds of stuff

2577
01:38:56,698 --> 01:39:03,299
yeah you know all kinds of stuff and so

2578
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:05,158
um you know dude's asking is it the sour

2579
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:07,619
I grew up with I don't know dude

2580
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:09,299
I don't know it would be nice if it

2581
01:39:07,619 --> 01:39:11,880
somehow ended up with me and I saved it

2582
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,320
you know uh that would be cool I can say

2583
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,779
that I haven't lost it in over two

2584
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,979
decades

2585
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:18,539
you know

2586
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:20,399
that's what I can say about it you know

2587
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:23,579
time will tell I suppose

2588
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:26,339
I mean I even just got uh sour from

2589
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:28,079
Caleb yeah just because I want to grow

2590
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:31,020
it next to mine

2591
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:34,500
and C just do the side by side

2592
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:36,719
I'm 99 sure his is the same one that me

2593
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:39,359
and pip and everyone else all use an

2594
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:41,819
archive yeah the chocolate one yeah the

2595
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:44,880
one I call choco mine's not that one

2596
01:39:41,819 --> 01:39:47,219
yeah I know that's so weird you know but

2597
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,560
it's like and and so I don't know I

2598
01:39:47,219 --> 01:39:51,359
don't you know I uh I thought for the

2599
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:53,639
longest time I hopefully called it Sour

2600
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,839
Diesel yeah and people will be like well

2601
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:58,679
what is it I'm like it's the center

2602
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,179
diesel yeah what name I don't know I

2603
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:02,699
have no idea and I thought when I

2604
01:40:00,179 --> 01:40:05,158
gathered up all those sours I would be

2605
01:40:02,698 --> 01:40:07,919
able to figure it out yeah you know I'm

2606
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:11,158
like okay I got ecsd I got nycd I got

2607
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:12,899
Joe B I got Amish I got choco I got

2608
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:16,379
these you know I got this i got this i

2609
01:40:12,899 --> 01:40:17,879
got this and it's none of this yeah

2610
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,920
you know

2611
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:22,560
um it's none of us so and then none of

2612
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,719
them were my La my headband cut either

2613
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,219
yeah I was figuring at least some the

2614
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,079
one thing that it did seem it did seem

2615
01:40:26,219 --> 01:40:30,779
like the choco and the ecsd were the

2616
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:33,059
same plan yeah yeah at least the

2617
01:40:30,779 --> 01:40:34,738
versions of them that I got I was the

2618
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:36,780
first person to call it choco and it was

2619
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:38,759
only because I saw Chapo's picture and I

2620
01:40:36,779 --> 01:40:40,079
was like hey that's [ __ ] that which

2621
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,820
one which which towers are you running

2622
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:44,340
the one that looks like Chacos that's

2623
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:46,799
the one that's the one and but it was it

2624
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:48,119
was always labeled ecsd always and

2625
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,840
what's funny is that it wasn't until

2626
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:54,479
like if it wasn't for Matt and pip and

2627
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,800
some of our other close friends

2628
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:56,939
um I probably wouldn't have done that

2629
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,800
experiment

2630
01:40:56,939 --> 01:41:00,899
yeah because they kept bugging me about

2631
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,779
what sour I had and I was like I don't

2632
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:05,519
have to sour it's the sour it's the one

2633
01:41:03,779 --> 01:41:08,759
I don't know I didn't even know there

2634
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,739
was so many because I got it so early

2635
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,420
um I just never got another one because

2636
01:41:10,738 --> 01:41:14,698
I had it

2637
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:17,340
so why would I trade for sour diesel

2638
01:41:14,698 --> 01:41:20,158
when I have a nice Sour Diesel and I

2639
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:20,760
didn't realize that it was

2640
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,738
um

2641
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:25,079
you know that there was so many

2642
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:26,638
did you know it was the [ __ ] Amherst

2643
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:31,139
did you did you try that one that

2644
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:33,000
Amherst I would say that the Amherst and

2645
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:35,699
the upstate New York and the real

2646
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,560
there's like four or five names that I

2647
01:41:35,698 --> 01:41:39,960
don't that Matt can probably verify that

2648
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:42,659
I don't I don't think they existed

2649
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:44,460
five or ten years ago there's a lot of

2650
01:41:42,658 --> 01:41:45,779
there's a ton of new names there's a

2651
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:48,000
different amount of there's a certain

2652
01:41:45,779 --> 01:41:50,039
amount of new names

2653
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,420
um you know that have come out and there

2654
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:54,359
was a decent amount of names in The

2655
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:56,158
Forum era yeah you know and I don't know

2656
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:58,079
like I just lived in Mendo I got the

2657
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,599
sour in 2000 or so we've had it a couple

2658
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:01,738
couple decades now or whatever I know we

2659
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,139
didn't lose it

2660
01:42:01,738 --> 01:42:06,359
and we thought that was Sour Diesel

2661
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:08,279
I remember there was an ERA where almost

2662
01:42:06,359 --> 01:42:10,380
everyone's Sour Diesel was so Miss New

2663
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:12,840
York City Diesel for a long time in the

2664
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:15,480
community 99 of the [ __ ] people were

2665
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,179
turning up with as sour was nycd

2666
01:42:15,479 --> 01:42:20,698
grapefruit 100. yeah Hunter Mountain

2667
01:42:18,179 --> 01:42:21,719
bruh I mean I don't even know like you

2668
01:42:20,698 --> 01:42:23,399
know I'm not even dissing Hunter

2669
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:24,899
Mountain or this or that or whatever I'm

2670
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:28,379
just saying that they weren't names in

2671
01:42:24,899 --> 01:42:31,019
common usage amongst traded cuts

2672
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:35,279
yeah you know

2673
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:36,960
um and uh you know and so uh you know it

2674
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:38,698
and there it seems like there was

2675
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,679
multiple phenos of sour even to begin

2676
01:42:38,698 --> 01:42:42,719
with yeah

2677
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:45,539
you know and then it became them yeah so

2678
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:47,698
trying to trying to declare the one the

2679
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:49,859
original the only sour is pretty

2680
01:42:47,698 --> 01:42:51,118
redundant now that we know I mean we're

2681
01:42:49,859 --> 01:42:52,738
pretty

2682
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,179
pretty convinced that there were at

2683
01:42:52,738 --> 01:42:56,819
least two or three sours going around

2684
01:42:54,179 --> 01:43:00,420
yeah and or two or three diesels I

2685
01:42:56,819 --> 01:43:02,519
should say I can say uh I can say

2686
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:04,859
um you know that uh

2687
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:07,440
I when I got it and that we've held it

2688
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:09,658
since and honestly you know back then in

2689
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:12,779
the early 2000s or whatever like I

2690
01:43:09,658 --> 01:43:14,638
didn't ask for all that lineage yeah I

2691
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:16,198
didn't ask of where it came from and how

2692
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,940
it got there and all that different

2693
01:43:16,198 --> 01:43:21,118
stuff and like trying to figure that out

2694
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:23,039
15 20 years later is a mess yeah I just

2695
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:24,658
got it then you know and I have this

2696
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:27,420
thing where it's like if I like weed

2697
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:29,279
I'll try to hold on to the weed yeah

2698
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:30,840
whether or not it becomes popular and

2699
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:32,880
what happens to most people is they get

2700
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:34,440
rid of anything that's not popular

2701
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,840
and then they try to get it back and

2702
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:38,099
it's not the same [ __ ] yeah and that's

2703
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,900
why everyone's like where's the real

2704
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:42,119
granddaddy purps where's the real this

2705
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:44,879
where's the real what now it's where's

2706
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:47,219
the real Sour yeah um someone's asking

2707
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,800
about Sour we have the the sour crust a

2708
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:51,779
blue bonnet that's pretty good for a uh

2709
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,699
regular sour seed line not a lot of

2710
01:43:51,779 --> 01:43:56,158
berry comes through archives got some

2711
01:43:53,698 --> 01:43:57,960
amazing Sauer crosses csi's got amazing

2712
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:01,319
sources

2713
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,239
um at top dogs got amazing sour stuff so

2714
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:04,559
yeah

2715
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:07,259
now that it's gained in popularity

2716
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,600
there's a bunch more people that are

2717
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:11,520
coming out of the woodwork with labeled

2718
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,139
sours and they're all old and they're

2719
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,540
all amazing and they're all this and

2720
01:44:13,139 --> 01:44:16,800
that and I think skunk VA probably has

2721
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:18,359
some too

2722
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,579
um but yeah that's who I'd recommend

2723
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:21,960
because there are so many people coming

2724
01:44:20,579 --> 01:44:23,819
out of the woodwork you don't know who

2725
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,319
to trust there's a bunch there's a bunch

2726
01:44:23,819 --> 01:44:27,719
right there people are asking about the

2727
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:30,719
spyrox hour spirock sour isn't sour

2728
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:33,118
spiral what the [ __ ] is

2729
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,859
it's something that's sold through some

2730
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:37,738
nurseries out on the west coast here

2731
01:44:34,859 --> 01:44:40,738
it's not a bad cut but it's it's some

2732
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:42,779
it's some Sour cut across the kush yeah

2733
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:45,359
because they were going for like sour

2734
01:44:42,779 --> 01:44:48,059
stretchiness but like more density

2735
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:49,979
you know and all that and so it's some

2736
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:52,739
hybrid it's not an it's not a real Sour

2737
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:54,959
cut someone's asking about skunk text

2738
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:57,059
diesel um I gave him the day record

2739
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,800
diesel but his what he calls the

2740
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:01,260
original diesel came from someone else

2741
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,579
uh for our last or probably the last

2742
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,960
time we talked about it it came for

2743
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:05,399
someone else so it's not the day record

2744
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,020
diesel that he's referring to yeah I

2745
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:10,019
mean it came from his buddy it seems

2746
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:13,260
like and it yeah and the dude got diesel

2747
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:16,619
you know uh back on the East Coast back

2748
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:19,500
when uh diesel was slang for Fireweed

2749
01:45:16,618 --> 01:45:21,479
yeah so we're not even sure how it's

2750
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,158
related or whatever else because he just

2751
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:25,799
got it as I mean the only reason why he

2752
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:27,118
calls it original diesel is the guy that

2753
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,960
gave it to him is because that's the

2754
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:29,960
diesel he got first

2755
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:35,519
original diesel so when I saw him post

2756
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:37,380
that and say he got it from that dude I

2757
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,760
was like what the [ __ ] but it turned out

2758
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:40,020
yes he did get a different cut for

2759
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,520
someone else yeah he did get a different

2760
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,199
kind and that's the name game you know

2761
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,940
and it's like that is yeah you know it's

2762
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:46,738
like I mean at some of these things you

2763
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:49,138
see people making all kinds of claims

2764
01:45:46,738 --> 01:45:51,899
about Sour Diesel I try to stay away

2765
01:45:49,139 --> 01:45:53,579
from all that because I got my cut in

2766
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:56,460
2000 or so

2767
01:45:53,579 --> 01:45:58,319
and uh which is a long ass time ago now

2768
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:01,380
but it's still you know it's still years

2769
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:03,719
after it was it was popped yeah and I

2770
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:05,760
got it on the West Coast yeah I'm not

2771
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:08,340
even old enough to have been around for

2772
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,860
when Sarah was first getting popular and

2773
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:12,000
being from the West Coast it's really uh

2774
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:14,039
it

2775
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,738
um like it's kind of like me you know I

2776
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:18,479
don't know me trying to say that I would

2777
01:46:16,738 --> 01:46:20,218
know what a real Sour was or the

2778
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:22,500
original sour was is kind of crazy in

2779
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:25,618
that sense

2780
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:28,920
I can I compare all sour diesels to the

2781
01:46:25,618 --> 01:46:30,719
sour diesel cut I have and not because I

2782
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:32,340
I'm just like all like oh mine's the

2783
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:34,920
best or whatever but mostly because

2784
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:37,079
that's my comparison point yeah that's

2785
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,420
the sour that I had forever that's what

2786
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:41,698
I consider to be sour so it's like is it

2787
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:43,618
the I don't know you know

2788
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:44,879
it's hard to say

2789
01:46:43,618 --> 01:46:47,158
um people are asking about the original

2790
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:49,199
diesel in here so archive his original

2791
01:46:47,158 --> 01:46:51,779
diesel is the shroomi diesel if I

2792
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,698
remember correctly and the one that we

2793
01:46:51,779 --> 01:46:57,420
have as original diesel is just the day

2794
01:46:53,698 --> 01:47:00,059
record it was because Amish

2795
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:03,420
yes yeah that same thing shroomy diesel

2796
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:05,219
Bahamas yeah yeah nice Cut and original

2797
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:06,600
I ran and then there's day record

2798
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:08,279
original

2799
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,020
and day rep original is my favorite

2800
01:47:08,279 --> 01:47:12,479
that's that's it's one of the most

2801
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:15,139
potent uh cuts that I have in potent

2802
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:15,138
breeders that I have

2803
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:21,480
yeah you know so all I can say is that

2804
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:23,880
most people don't keep things unless

2805
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:24,959
it's popular and it's easy to sell

2806
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,079
yeah

2807
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,880
I hold on to things that I like you know

2808
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:31,618
um so I held on to that sour even when

2809
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,359
it was really unpopular

2810
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:34,738
yeah and then people are like how did

2811
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:37,279
the good sour go away it's because

2812
01:47:34,738 --> 01:47:40,079
nobody wanted to most good Cuts go away

2813
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:42,000
because people aren't willing to hold

2814
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:44,158
them when they're not popular

2815
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,600
yeah and then everyone wants them back

2816
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:48,479
as soon as there's money to be made and

2817
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:50,880
there's rep to be had yep

2818
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,079
simple as that over and over and over

2819
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,359
again

2820
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:56,519
yeah you know so then so how does that

2821
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:59,279
all work it's like they only want it you

2822
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:02,400
could I could spread out my diesel and

2823
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:04,920
if no and if if in five years nobody was

2824
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:06,000
into sour a tiny percentage of heads

2825
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,859
would keep it

2826
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,238
yeah because that's what happened that's

2827
01:48:07,859 --> 01:48:10,859
what happened to Urkel

2828
01:48:09,238 --> 01:48:13,138
that's what happened to Green Crack it's

2829
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:15,539
what happened to everything yeah shit's

2830
01:48:13,139 --> 01:48:17,520
a lot of shit's gone that I mean there's

2831
01:48:15,539 --> 01:48:19,500
another cut the other day someone hit me

2832
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,760
up and asked for forum and I was like

2833
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,500
what do you mean you want a forum what

2834
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,600
do you mean forums missing he's like I

2835
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:27,300
can't find forum and I'm like we can't

2836
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,699
find Forum that's oh that's a horror cut

2837
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:31,500
but yeah I mean that's funny I see

2838
01:48:29,698 --> 01:48:32,819
people and I'm not making if anyone's

2839
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,920
listening and this is you don't take

2840
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:38,340
offense but I was like man I want that

2841
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:39,779
real Sour Diesel from like back in 2010

2842
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:42,119
yeah

2843
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:45,059
you know and you think about it and it's

2844
01:48:42,118 --> 01:48:48,118
like that's not that long ago yeah no

2845
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:49,500
it turns out uh you know

2846
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:53,519
um we don't know which cut skunk Tech

2847
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:55,800
sour is identifying sours is really hard

2848
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,060
you know it seems like it seems like at

2849
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,980
the very least what you can say by

2850
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:01,500
people that are trying my sour right now

2851
01:48:58,979 --> 01:49:03,899
is that it's not very well circulated

2852
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,399
yeah and it's not one of the common

2853
01:49:03,899 --> 01:49:07,259
named cuts

2854
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:09,299
yeah

2855
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:11,760
you know okay my ring my Ring's gonna

2856
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:13,139
keep going off non-stop so we could

2857
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,539
probably try to end it soon this is

2858
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:17,579
driving me nuts oh my god well we are an

2859
01:49:15,539 --> 01:49:19,618
hour and 50 minutes in yeah doing all

2860
01:49:17,579 --> 01:49:21,238
right yeah we're doing good we're doing

2861
01:49:19,618 --> 01:49:23,339
all right so yeah I mean we can do we

2862
01:49:21,238 --> 01:49:25,319
tried to talk a little bro science and

2863
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:27,480
stuff like that and ended up on Cuts but

2864
01:49:25,319 --> 01:49:29,579
that's the hardest part for me as a

2865
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:31,738
collector is that nobody wants to

2866
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:33,179
[ __ ] help me back [ __ ] up when shit's

2867
01:49:31,738 --> 01:49:34,979
unpopular

2868
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:37,139
and then everybody wants it when they

2869
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:38,879
can make some money off it

2870
01:49:37,139 --> 01:49:39,900
and then it goes back to nobody wants to

2871
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,279
help you back it up because it's

2872
01:49:39,899 --> 01:49:43,259
unpopular

2873
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:45,300
rinse repeat

2874
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:49,679
and we're about to enter the most you

2875
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:51,239
