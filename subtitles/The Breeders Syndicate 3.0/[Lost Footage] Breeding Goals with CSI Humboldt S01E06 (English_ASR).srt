1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,040
still says Green Room

2
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,300
there we go welcome everyone this is

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,179
breeder Syndicate and today we have CSI

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,160
Humboldt and our coach not so dog so I

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,420
hope everyone's stoked uh this is gonna

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,920
be a good one so we're going to be

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,740
talking today about breeding goals not

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,320
so you want to take it away and run with

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,939
the topic yeah sure so I mean the last

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,379
few episodes or whatever we've been

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,719
chatting a little bit about like

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,579
breeding history and various aspects of

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,219
it we talked a little bit about terms

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,558
and we thought maybe it would be better

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,960
to chat about something that's not

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,878
talked about too often which is like

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,558
what are your goals when you take two

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,479
things and you cross them together what

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,299
are you hoping that each parent might

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,738
give the children of that and then talk

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,538
a little bit about like sort of the

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,058
state of where things are and what's

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,739
popular and methods and things like that

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,659
so

25
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,640
um yeah I mean that's kind of where

26
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,919
we're gonna bring it obviously this is

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,719
the first time we've had three people on

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,359
it so it's a little different super

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,118
stoked that uh our buddy was willing to

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,599
come on and join us because he is one of

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,299
the most uh prolific uh breeders that I

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,539
know of so uh he's lots of he has lots

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,400
of experience uh success failures all

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,240
that type of stuff so we're pretty

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,359
excited to uh have him on and to be able

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,158
to chat it up about this subject so uh

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,019
we're just gonna kind of get started

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,900
what do you want to start at

39
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,819
uh you know maybe maybe we could just

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,020
start at sort of like

41
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,699
um

42
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,640
you know maybe we could just started

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,259
breeding goals yeah you know so maybe

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,540
we'll start with there's a lot of people

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,459
out there today and this is this is a

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,060
legitimate thing to do but I think it's

47
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:53,759
a little too common maybe where uh oh we

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,859
just lost anyway so well hopefully he

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,099
pops back on but we

50
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:02,159
um a lot a lot of breeding today is um

51
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,199
you know people crossing two things that

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,140
they don't you know that most people

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,939
don't have access to right and then when

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,180
you buy that when you buy that hybrid

55
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,800
you're hoping to find you know one of

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
those cuts that you don't have access to

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,239
right something they consider Elite

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,099
hopefully find it something that they

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,439
can that they can consider Elite right

60
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,859
so maybe a really really good example

61
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,859
that's like fairly recent uh yeah uh

62
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,720
somehow Caleb was uh was perfect for the

63
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,580
30 minutes and then within 30 seconds of

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,859
joining he got booted so hopefully he'll

65
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,599
pop back on in a minute but yeah

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,459
um you know well maybe we'll talk about

67
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,979
like for instance Skittles for a second

68
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,140
so you know Skittles comes out Skittles

69
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,539
starts winning a bunch of awards uh the

70
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:49,259
Skittles crew held on to Skittles pretty

71
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,359
tight for a bit so I get emerald cup and

72
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,759
some different other events

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
people buying hybrids of it was

74
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,079
literally the only way that they could

75
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
get a hold of it right and so that's one

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
of the way that's one of the things that

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,800
drives breeding in some in some

78
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,238
instances something gets famous

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,099
it could be Skittles could be cookies

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,739
could be Kush could be any number of

81
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,539
different things and then most people

82
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,400
don't have access to that cut because

83
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,979
maybe it's hoarded or maybe the circles

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,180
are still pretty tight or whatever and

85
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,699
so

86
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,739
um the pricing and the desirability for

87
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,719
people to buy seeds of that thing become

88
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,239
pretty high yeah

89
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,979
supply and demand how it always works

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,340
yeah it's supply and demand basically

91
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,899
and so that that is driven actually a

92
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,219
lot of breeding

93
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,439
um because you're just you're just

94
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,658
offering up you know hey you can't get

95
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,878
the cut but you know maybe you'll find

96
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,399
something in Skittles by TK that you'll

97
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,500
like yeah you know and that that drives

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,420
a lot of breeding and so that's kind of

99
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,098
been like one of the the modern ways

100
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,098
that people do things is that they're

101
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:56,539
mashing together a bunch of Famous Cuts

102
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:58,919
yeah uh it was certainly the the the

103
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:01,620
revolution certainly happened with

104
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,139
feminized breeding and it allows you to

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,239
eliminate males for the most part

106
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,759
um and read you could take two very

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,120
famous cuts and mash them together

108
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,219
and so that sort of started this era of

109
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,719
like I'm gonna take a famous cut I'm

110
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,899
going to try to reverse it and I'm gonna

111
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,199
put you know however many 10 or 20 other

112
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,418
Famous Cuts in the room with it

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,100
and boom now I have all these different

114
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,680
lines

115
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,300
um you know so that's kind of that's one

116
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,620
of the the more modern ways that people

117
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,379
do things but a long time ago

118
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,660
uh and by long I mean say 12 or 13 years

119
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,319
ago because I think yeah Matt can clear

120
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,660
this up but I think 0809 you know that

121
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,740
was sort of like the first era that

122
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,800
people started reversing females yeah

123
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,780
right around that 0708 I would say that

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,100
some of the first people to do it would

125
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:03,779
be uh uh OG rascal absolutely Matt

126
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,060
himself uh CSI uh there wasn't very many

127
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:09,599
people doing it the technology wasn't

128
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,360
very well known at that point in time

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
um but previous to 12 years ago or 13

130
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,780
years ago everybody used males

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,819
yeah that was the you use males so we'll

132
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,258
talk a bit about males because that's

133
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,120
sort of where

134
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,639
um you know that was the state of

135
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,060
reading for the longest time yeah you

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,460
know uh and one of the things about

137
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,259
males that was that's a lot harder than

138
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,180
taking two Elites that you already know

139
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,360
people like two females that are already

140
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,000
awesome and Crossing them together is

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,800
males don't give you nearly the same

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,180
level of

143
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,240
um what's the best way to describe

144
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,819
the traits that you can sense we use we

145
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,699
use the we consume the females

146
00:05:53,819 --> 00:06:00,240
and we only really use males for

147
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,740
breeding so males you know what traits

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,460
they're going to pass on was a lot more

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,860
mysterious yeah right so uh what people

150
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,799
used to do is let's say that you have

151
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,680
some females that you think are amazing

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,740
um and you know you want to cross them

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,860
back in the day you would have to cross

154
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,019
it to a male and see what and grow

155
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,699
actually grow out the beans and see what

156
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,579
that male gate

157
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,680
yeah right and sometimes people would

158
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,459
take like let's say for instance you

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,500
know

160
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,680
um you might take four or five different

161
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,060
males yeah cross them separately to the

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,639
same female

163
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,639
and then grow out each batch

164
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,479
these two these two males I don't like

165
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,879
what they gave to their kids that's not

166
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:50,399
what I'm looking for yeah but male three

167
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,600
male feet three through the traits that

168
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,060
I'm looking for

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,340
right yeah so a lot of times it was

170
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,720
pretty laborious in the sense that you

171
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,399
didn't really know which one you wanted

172
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,940
to work with until you started growing

173
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,399
their kids yeah and that's that's

174
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,860
typically how most breeders do it and

175
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,579
that's how most breeders have done it uh

176
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,000
throughout time so breeding used to be a

177
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:18,478
much more time consuming process yeah in

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,379
that regard to find things out you know

179
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,818
um and uh you know so so that's kind of

180
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,800
how that's kind of how things started

181
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,900
but there was a lot of

182
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,220
throw some pollen on your favorite

183
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,978
females

184
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,780
and see what happens right a lot of

185
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,478
things people don't that people take for

186
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:39,839
granted when it comes to males first is

187
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,579
that there is one one single thing that

188
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,098
you will use for selection on a mail

189
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,318
like I only select males that are sturdy

190
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,759
you know or I only select males that

191
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,139
have hollow stems because that's going

192
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,098
to tell me it's going to breed the way I

193
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,259
want

194
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:53,939
um but back in the day yeah you had to

195
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,560
run the progeny to see what traits are

196
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,038
going to be bred for it's not males

197
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,500
don't have that that uh a a high terpene

198
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,060
content like females so even if it did

199
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,259
even if you have a male that you can

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,579
smell the terpenes on it doesn't

201
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,580
necessarily mean it's going to breed

202
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,098
that way it's just an expression it's

203
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:13,560
just an expression so yeah uh you know

204
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:16,139
there's um you know and and so maybe

205
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,780
maybe we'll we'll talk about a few

206
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,579
really famous lines uh just because

207
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,918
they're they're famous so everybody

208
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,079
should know about them and this is what

209
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,478
people back in the day so now what's

210
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,279
very common is people mishmash a bunch

211
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,439
of famous stuff together

212
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,360
and then they sell it and they're hoping

213
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,158
that people will find some nice plants

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,519
or some Elites or some whatever in their

215
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:41,038
progeny yeah but most breeding is not

216
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,559
done like that uh in cannabis and

217
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,059
especially in other areas correct most

218
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,179
breeding is

219
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,979
I have traits from this line that I want

220
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:54,419
there he is

221
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:58,500
you made it back can you hear us

222
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:02,519
he's back he's smiling it okay so man so

223
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,519
you know um most breeding back in the

224
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,519
day uh was you would take you would have

225
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,320
two lines and you would have certain

226
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,080
traits from each line that you were

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,360
hoping to combine into one line

228
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,339
right that was kind of that was kind of

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,839
the goal so yeah maybe we'll take

230
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,820
something like

231
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,399
um like nl5 Haze because it's super

232
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,379
famous and we chatted about it before so

233
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,259
you know there was this Haze plant it

234
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:30,958
took 18 to 24 weeks it didn't form the

235
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,240
greatest buds but it had great High it

236
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,039
had a great great terp profile had a

237
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
bunch of stuff and they were trying to

238
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,179
figure out how to make it

239
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,360
semi-reasonable to grow and so they

240
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,699
picked this NL plant which had basically

241
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,000
no smell but had a lot of a lot of

242
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,740
crystal and a lot of um you know a lot

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,379
of a lot of resin a lot of good

244
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,919
structure and it took way way way less

245
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:57,958
time so they were trying to blend the

246
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,259
flavor and the effect and the

247
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:04,139
stretchiness of the haze with the resin

248
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:07,799
content the shorter flowering time and

249
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,299
the fudge structure of the NL yeah right

250
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,939
and that was kind of the goal they

251
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:14,039
mashed them together and then you know

252
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,800
another point we should probably make is

253
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,019
that the more traits you're trying to

254
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,359
find from each parent line in the

255
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,919
children the harder it is

256
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,600
yeah

257
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,679
you know they were talking about this

258
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
yesterday

259
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,819
um it's really really hard to select for

260
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,159
more than one or two traits in cannabis

261
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,320
because it has so many [ __ ] traits uh

262
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,338
trades we don't talk about like root uh

263
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,019
one of the main ones we don't talk about

264
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,000
is root Expressions uh different

265
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,100
different root sizes different root

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,419
hairs you know there's so many different

267
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,040
expressions and you really can only

268
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,259
breed for a few traits in cannabis at a

269
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,838
time so yeah it makes it tough I mean

270
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,879
there was a there was a line that uh

271
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,100
that Shanti Baba released a long time

272
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,200
ago uh used to be called Peacemaker it

273
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,379
was also called great white shark now

274
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,778
it's called shark shock I think and uh

275
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,360
you know it was it's skunk it's skunk by

276
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,980
White Widow and I ran through a few

277
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,560
hundred of those seeds I really liked it

278
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,899
it I found some incredibly potent pot

279
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,799
but all the potent stuff didn't taste

280
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,958
like much

281
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,659
and all the stuff that's was really

282
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,659
skunky didn't get me high very much yeah

283
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:21,000
and I kept trying to find one that had

284
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,759
both but I couldn't

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,019
you know I still liked it I kept one for

286
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,179
a long time that was really really

287
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,679
potent but it kind of tasted like it

288
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,078
didn't have bad flavor it just kind of

289
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,679
tasted like like good smoke

290
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,299
yeah that was about it right and so

291
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,578
um you know most people they don't talk

292
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,219
today about like you know and maybe

293
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,359
Caleb can jump in on this too but you

294
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,759
know when you're looking at two

295
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,000
different things right if you're gonna

296
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,278
cross Skittles by this what do you want

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,519
each what are you hoping that maybe each

298
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,679
parent might give the seeds might give

299
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,019
the children that you are excited about

300
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,338
like what are your goals and that's kind

301
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,679
of like the theme of what we want to

302
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,100
talk about today is like breeding goals

303
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:08,159
oh we lost them again

304
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,540
so uh humble but I I teed him up to

305
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,278
start talking and then he disappears

306
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,338
right so

307
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,200
um you know but anyway so I guess I'll

308
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,600
check are you there

309
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,980
he's there he just doesn't have video

310
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,500
right there

311
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,959
yeah your video is gone but you're here

312
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,700
you can hear me yeah I can hear you I

313
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,639
just can't see you sir

314
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,200
my phone's acting up all kinds it I even

315
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,000
have a thing that says warning it looks

316
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
like you're B so I'm thinking that's

317
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,440
battery is overheating

318
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,000
oh wow yeah so maybe try audio without

319
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,760
the video

320
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,559
okay okay yeah we'll try it this way

321
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,899
shouldn't shouldn't be too hard on it

322
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,879
that way oh right when connections Get

323
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,700
Low we'll cut the video so maybe you've

324
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,639
got some like Humboldt Style

325
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:58,100
80s connections that uh so maybe maybe

326
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:01,019
audio Maybe audio will work yeah

327
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,899
my connection is actually weak I don't

328
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,940
know why can you hear us well yeah yeah

329
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,940
yeah yeah I can hear and see you just

330
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,800
fine

331
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,320
what I was talking about right before is

332
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,078
sort of like when you CR when people

333
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,000
cross things what are the ideas and what

334
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,219
are the hopes behind what they're

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,958
looking for to for each parent to give

336
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,420
right what are the traits they're

337
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,278
looking or they're hopeful that the the

338
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,240
parent might give

339
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,700
um right

340
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,220
you know and so one of the things that

341
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,160
one of the things that kind of I I think

342
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,040
separates uh CSI from a lot of other

343
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,100
people is that a lot of people cross

344
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,259
things and never test them and they just

345
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,259
release them to the public right yeah

346
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,559
right right but if you if you go back on

347
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:52,500
uh on csi's page you can go back years

348
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,319
and see him running crosses of his own

349
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,519
hybrids for a long time and what that

350
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,860
does is that actually gives you an idea

351
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,940
of what the parents you're using throw

352
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,940
in their progeny

353
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,899
which ones are consistent breeders which

354
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,060
ones are a mess and are all over the

355
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,940
place you know there's some things out

356
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,859
there that it might be amazing clones

357
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,260
um that breed like crap

358
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,419
you know they they don't transfer the

359
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,000
qualities of the mother cut into its

360
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,338
children very much and so breeders

361
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,039
naturally when they find things that

362
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,360
work they tend to go back to them

363
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,559
right right

364
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,360
I mean most people generally want what I

365
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,578
consider mythical plants

366
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,519
they want plants that are high yield

367
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,638
High potency extremely flavorful just

368
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,600
like you were talking about you know

369
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,579
they want everything in one plant and

370
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,980
not only one plant but they want all the

371
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,379
seeds to be everything and that's not

372
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,680
the reality of it you know yeah like

373
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:01,860
with your Skittles example I mean it it

374
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:04,620
if I'm breeding with Skittles my goal is

375
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,320
to take the best characteristics of

376
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,659
Skittles which would be the flavor and

377
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,579
the smell

378
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:13,078
and hopefully incorporate that into

379
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,778
something

380
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,458
um with another desirable characteristic

381
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:20,820
from the other parent which would be

382
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:23,119
maybe like yield or potency you know

383
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,120
what I mean

384
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,199
special for breeding

385
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,579
for your purposes

386
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,019
say what what

387
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:35,759
some of the other lines you've worked

388
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,019
with that you feel have special traits

389
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
and characteristics that maybe maybe

390
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,899
they that breed true for it that you

391
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,680
really enjoy that you found over the

392
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,259
years

393
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,919
oh I mean you know I love the love the

394
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:49,500
urkles the whole family yeah I love

395
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,778
triangle Kush you know OG Kush in

396
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,399
general I think it's just you know a

397
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:55,559
great building block

398
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,259
um and then the chem family

399
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,219
um you know which you know most people

400
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,500
know

401
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,899
uh my opinion on that I I think it's

402
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,320
just really chem 91 and everything past

403
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,720
that is a chem hybrid or poly hybrid

404
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,899
yeah you know I agree

405
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,899
yeah I uh you know that it's a it's a

406
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,179
delicate subject but I think that uh you

407
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,339
know plants don't lie and when you've

408
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,379
grown a lot of these chem chem plants

409
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,720
for a long time and especially cross

410
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,480
them and see what's in them uh it does

411
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,120
seem that way you know uh you know one

412
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,980
of the things that uh that came from me

413
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,220
but I don't think anybody has used it

414
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,139
more than than uh Caleb is

415
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,660
um the the Mendo perps is probably a

416
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,778
good example uh because the Mendo perps

417
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:45,899
is it's fast it's fairly fast finishing

418
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:48,899
it's got crazy colors in it it's got

419
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:53,578
very unique Terps uh but it's pretty low

420
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,839
potency uh you know in regard and so you

421
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,059
know um

422
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,339
one of the one of the you know one of

423
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,319
the things that uh that he he released

424
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:04,199
that that you know got a name cut was

425
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,860
this Obama kush where he married uh

426
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,779
Mendo P to uh Bubble Kush and the Bubba

427
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,058
added a bunch of frost it added a bunch

428
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,818
of structure it added much more potency

429
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:18,418
and then the Mendo P seemed to add a lot

430
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:20,639
of pretty color and gave the bubba some

431
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,500
different unique smells

432
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,059
um

433
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,720
that's the really good example of like

434
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:29,220
taking the strengths from one plant and

435
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,140
Crossing it to something else where

436
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,140
those strengths or weaknesses

437
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,538
right yep you know

438
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,799
um you know and then you know there's

439
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,259
things that there's things that interest

440
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,660
people so what I always recommend people

441
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,240
do when they're breeding uh because

442
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,440
breeding is a lot of work uh it's time

443
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,798
consuming and there's a certain amount

444
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,620
of failure involved is if you have goals

445
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:55,558
or you're passionate about certain

446
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:57,538
plants you're using then that to me

447
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,399
that's the coolest kind of breeding you

448
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,859
know if you're like I want to take these

449
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,480
traits from this plant and I want to see

450
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:05,339
if I can get these traits and these

451
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,519
traits from these two plants into one

452
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,500
plant yeah right and you know when

453
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,839
you're passionate about something you

454
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,298
know as as Caleb just mentioned he just

455
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,699
rolled through you know favorites and he

456
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,859
might be able to explain at length why

457
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,779
each one of those strains

458
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,519
um you know why you know there's

459
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:25,379
probably a combination of traits that he

460
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,599
likes in each one of those and there's

461
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,059
also probably a combination of not only

462
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,240
those traits he likes but they pass

463
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:35,099
those traits onto the kids you know

464
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,759
pretty consistently

465
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,759
um you know

466
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,798
so I don't know I mean maybe you want to

467
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,200
like one of the things you've told me in

468
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,660
the past Caleb is that of a lot of the

469
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,279
things that you use the chem 91 seems to

470
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,640
be one of the most consistent breeders

471
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,879
for adding potency to its progeny right

472
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,259
right and you know uh

473
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,419
on on that one I uh I also think that

474
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,119
you know and I I've told you both this

475
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,860
you know plenty of times I I have a

476
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:09,000
strong suspicion that I think the chem

477
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:11,639
91 itself is an S1 from its original

478
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,880
Source in Colorado

479
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,820
um so I think that might have something

480
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,100
to do with the with the you know it's

481
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:22,379
propensity to pass on that strength

482
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:25,259
because it's it's kind of like a

483
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,880
bottlenecked S1 already you know yeah

484
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,940
and uh

485
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,900
you know um anytime you go you know S1

486
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,600
F2 etc etc you know things I think are

487
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,960
more stable and easier to pass forward

488
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:43,139
as long as they're not like a recessive

489
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,600
yeah yeah but

490
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,299
um it's very consistent in up in the

491
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,038
potency on whatever you cross it to you

492
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,859
know whether it's you know feminized or

493
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,720
regular seeds or whatever

494
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,699
you know what are some of the traits you

495
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,919
like about bubble gum I know that's one

496
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,140
you use extensively and and uh your

497
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,380
advice uh I used it for the bubbleberry

498
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm super stoked on it how it breathes

499
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,620
I mean I love the bubble gum cut because

500
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,840
it's one of the best plants I've ever

501
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:13,678
grown Out outdoors

502
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:18,359
um

503
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,820
just almost mold proof you know yeah and

504
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,979
it's extremely Frosty has a sweet you

505
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,700
know bubble gum smell

506
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,640
um

507
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,759
and it's just a nice all-around plant

508
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,280
now yeah does it does it compare with

509
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,879
today's you know hypey stuff and

510
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:38,279
probably not but you know for for you

511
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,400
know somebody who's farming outdoors and

512
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:44,519
you know looking for something uh you

513
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,660
know that's you know fairly stable and

514
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:52,379
you know mold prone uh or mold blue

515
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:55,080
proof I mean you know those are some of

516
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,720
my favorite characteristics of it yeah

517
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,038
for sure and that's that's one of the

518
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,500
things that we should probably mention

519
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,480
too is that so if you're really if

520
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,160
you're passionate about breeding and

521
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,099
you're trying to combine certain traits

522
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,440
I mean amongst us you know we might back

523
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:13,139
and forth uh a lot of different ideas

524
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,600
and get excited about a lot of random

525
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,460
stuff but there's also this thing in the

526
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,619
back of your mind and in which in order

527
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,298
to be a successful breeder uh people

528
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:24,418
will have to want to buy your stuff and

529
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:27,298
have success with it so a lot of these

530
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,620
practical traits uh like he was just

531
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:30,658
talking about

532
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,239
um great outdoor plant highly mold

533
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:35,280
resistant that type of thing those

534
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,400
things can be really important right

535
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,319
because you know people want like as

536
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,659
Caleb was mentioning earlier people want

537
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,460
buy a pack of seeds and that to be the

538
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:47,760
best growing best yielding greatest

539
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,980
structure crazy Terps you know super

540
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:53,400
potent they want all the beans to be

541
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,099
that way which is rare but then if even

542
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,640
if it had that but it molded like crazy

543
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:02,038
people would be pissed yeah yep you know

544
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,100
so if if you if there's problems

545
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,140
inherent in a line like high mold or

546
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:09,119
hermaphrodism or something else like

547
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,700
that you can better believe that people

548
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,500
are going to focus on that rather than

549
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,480
this is the most potent flavorful

550
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,240
fastest growing thing I've grown in

551
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,038
forever I found four bananas and a

552
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,120
couple of the big of the biggest colas

553
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:26,700
rotted and now I think it's a [ __ ] cross

554
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,739
you know it makes it difficult you know

555
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,080
uh because there's a certain amount of

556
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,319
commercial satisfaction that's required

557
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,359
right oftentimes it's the environment

558
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:40,379
that causes the problems

559
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,058
yeah that is very true you know or or

560
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,880
you know I can't I can't even imagine

561
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:47,940
I'm not a I'm not a public breeder uh

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,220
but both Matt and Caleb are the amount

563
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,320
of you know the amount of uh responses

564
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,200
they get of like hey these seeds didn't

565
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,658
pop right or they died a few days after

566
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,900
I cracked them or they turned out like

567
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,340
like [ __ ] and I blame you you know I

568
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,340
mean most of the time sometimes

569
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:07,379
sometimes it is you know uh of the scene

570
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:10,619
maker but a lot of times it's breed it's

571
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,720
it's user error uh I've never I've never

572
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,639
gotten any comments like that mine

573
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,860
everything's always perfect everything's

574
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,600
always perfect

575
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:19,740
you know and and we don't need to we

576
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,119
don't need to name names or anything

577
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,519
like that because that's not the point

578
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,379
of it but there was a super famous line

579
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,839
that was released a number of years ago

580
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,700
that was very expensive and very hyped

581
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,240
up and the people that made it didn't

582
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,038
even bother to do a germ test yeah and a

583
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,440
germ test for people that don't know is

584
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:41,158
if you're a breeder you take 50 or 100

585
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,679
or 200 of your seed and you pop them a

586
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,840
few times in paper towels or or in dirt

587
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,298
or whatever and you make sure that

588
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,819
there's nothing funky and they germinate

589
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:54,798
well yeah you know there's occasionally

590
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,798
crosses you make that don't germ well

591
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,339
and so there was there was a line that

592
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:01,019
was released that they didn't even do a

593
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,319
germ test on and then people bought

594
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,819
expensive seeds and then 70 of them

595
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,399
didn't even pop

596
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:10,439
and it was so consistent that it wasn't

597
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,059
really user error because when you start

598
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,700
getting just hundreds and hundreds of

599
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:16,740
complaints about the same issue yeah

600
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,298
um a germ test is something that takes

601
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,620
you know less than a week to really

602
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:21,619
figure out yeah

603
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,058
what do you what do you think causes the

604
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,500
you know poor germination rates like

605
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:31,918
that

606
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,319
you know you know the I mean Matt you

607
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,980
can speak to it if you want you know uh

608
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:40,558
what What's it called the the spermas

609
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,880
that's in the uh in the Shell might not

610
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,519
be developed properly so it wasn't

611
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,140
getting proper food it could be minor

612
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,298
cracks I mean sure there's all kinds of

613
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,980
[ __ ] reasons but some of it would

614
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:52,440
probably be what recessive genetics

615
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,419
people are calling it out in in the

616
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,220
comments because it was obvious what it

617
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:59,460
was it was candy rain and I'm not trying

618
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,659
to diss anyone but one of the things one

619
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,840
of the things that I was going to say is

620
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,760
that you can inbreed in cannabis uh more

621
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,959
so than you can in other things a little

622
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,359
bit

623
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,700
um but when you start inbreeding too

624
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,859
much and your and your hybrids are a

625
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,038
mishmash of the same four or five cuts

626
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,899
over and over and over again you will on

627
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,140
occasion start to get undesirable

628
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,480
recessives or undesirable traits that

629
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,000
pop up and one of those traits could be

630
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,819
like some mutant funky seeds uh

631
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,460
blueberry I mean yeah yeah but you know

632
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,678
Caleb can talk about it too but you know

633
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,919
because he does a lot of s1s and he's

634
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:42,179
even done some S2s but as you start

635
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:45,000
going to S3 S4 S5 things start getting

636
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,919
significantly more difficult the plants

637
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,980
start getting way weaker the germination

638
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,159
rates become a lot tougher so there's a

639
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,200
real limit there uh you know in in how

640
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,940
far you can inbreed before you start to

641
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,919
hit problems

642
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,220
um and I haven't inbred that deep but

643
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:04,080
but uh Caleb Caleb has a little bit more

644
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,579
than I have in terms of experimentation

645
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,178
so

646
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:08,819
um

647
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,679
you know uh yeah there's there's issues

648
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:12,839
with inbreeding you can combine

649
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,080
undesirable traits and have them become

650
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:19,918
a little bit more dominant even even in

651
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:23,000
S2s there's a lot of plants that will

652
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,000
not produce pollen

653
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,400
yeah they won't move forward when

654
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,440
reversed of course you know yeah

655
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,019
yeah

656
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,900
and so you know reversals reversals have

657
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:41,038
become sort of the norm uh it's flipped

658
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:44,400
in this in the 60s 70s 80s 90s and the

659
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,859
first decade of the 2000s uh the all

660
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,840
breeding for the most part uh was was

661
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:51,658
right what we call regular breeding

662
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,418
using males and females

663
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:57,000
um you know the only feminized breeding

664
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:59,220
that happened was typically accidental

665
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,339
uh you know hermaphrodism or something

666
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,100
along those lines bag seeds uh that type

667
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:08,278
of thing and uh you know and then the

668
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:11,219
revolution happened uh you know 13 12 13

669
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,619
years ago where the technology on how to

670
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,640
reverse cannabis became more well-known

671
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:19,259
and now I would say it's flipped and the

672
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,659
percentage of people that uses actual

673
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,940
males is extremely low

674
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:28,200
and the vast majority of the seed game

675
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,880
today is feminized in some way you know

676
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,600
um and it's a really it's a really

677
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,960
valuable tool but as both of uh my

678
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,418
co-hosts today can express uh you know

679
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,340
we were joking before we came on live is

680
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,960
that you know when I use traditional

681
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,720
males and a lot of my breeding I never

682
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,120
had a single breeding failure yeah um

683
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,480
where when you reverse things you can

684
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,719
have failure you can have not very much

685
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,419
pollen you can have sterile pollen you

686
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,980
can have the pollen sacks not open and

687
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,919
you have to go through a lot of manual

688
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,339
labor to extract using screens and stuff

689
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,440
the pollen from the pollen sacks

690
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,298
um you know in the old days you have one

691
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,679
male in a room you're guaranteed you're

692
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:16,200
gonna pollinate the entire room right in

693
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,440
today's world uh you know Caleb was just

694
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,140
chatting about it he might use 10 or 12.

695
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,860
uh females that are marked for reversal

696
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,679
yeah in the hopes that a few of them are

697
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:30,778
you know dump a lot and some a couple of

698
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,600
them dump some and a few dump a little

699
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:35,819
and then you've got a few failures

700
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,759
um and so it's it's uh it's pretty

701
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:40,379
difficult because it's not consistent

702
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,599
um you know people have great success

703
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,100
reversing a plant once and they do the

704
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,298
same thing again and for whatever reason

705
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:49,019
it doesn't work

706
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:51,839
yeah so uh the the you know we have a

707
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:54,720
lot of theories as to why uh is the mix

708
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,839
too strong or too weak is there a range

709
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,700
of of the mix that leads to you know

710
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,859
pollen dumping with some strains versus

711
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,019
others but it's mostly like

712
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:06,959
observational because we all don't have

713
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:09,000
labs to really analyze why the failure

714
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,058
went wrong yeah

715
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,359
um you know and uh you know it also

716
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:17,460
leads to you know in some cases uh you

717
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,979
know people get mad at hermaphrodism but

718
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,700
there's some plants that don't harm and

719
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,038
therefore they're a [ __ ] to reverse

720
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,960
[Music]

721
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,700
like I was telling you guys uh you know

722
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,700
just just a couple days ago I had to

723
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,759
chop down a a whole room at four weeks

724
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,600
flower because you know I reversed eight

725
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,940
you know nice big bushes of old Betsy

726
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:44,759
and none of them produced any pollen

727
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,320
whatsoever and the way I do things I I

728
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,599
don't really have a fallback a lot of

729
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,178
the times and so if it fails I just have

730
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,099
to chop a whole room down and start over

731
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,778
again and

732
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,898
that's just the price of doing business

733
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:59,278
but it old Betsy not reversing kind of

734
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:02,099
made me sad because she's one of my

735
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,778
favorite old girls you know so yeah and

736
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,599
you know there's some there's some lines

737
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:08,640
uh you know uh there's a lot of uh

738
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,398
there's a lot of people uh that have

739
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,380
tried to reverse various Diesel and sour

740
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,019
Cuts

741
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:18,480
they're notorious for not giving you

742
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:20,879
commercial viable amounts of pollen to

743
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,339
produce a bunch of candy miserable uh

744
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,399
people have been having really great

745
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,980
results with some of Caleb's TK crosses

746
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,739
yeah um but you know Caleb can speak to

747
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,980
this but I think he failed two or three

748
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,319
times three times

749
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,058
yep yeah three times and then when he

750
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,099
did even have success it was probably

751
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:42,960
like a fifth of the success that he

752
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:45,240
would normally have on a good reversal

753
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,778
yeah

754
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,940
um

755
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:49,740
you know so there's there's a lot of

756
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,840
that like there's a there's there's

757
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,000
failure a lot of a lot of breeding

758
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,819
failure used to be

759
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,380
you breed something and then the progeny

760
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:01,319
the children don't give you what you

761
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,960
were hoping for yeah but in feminized

762
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,519
breeding there's a lot of actual failure

763
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,579
to fertilize

764
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,819
right you know that goes on

765
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:13,918
even by extremely experienced people

766
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:16,678
that do it all the time and for a living

767
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,179
and have real good techniques down and

768
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,259
have done it a bunch and had a lot of

769
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,380
success

770
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:25,980
you you know I'd like to add too though

771
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:30,539
um that when breeding feminized

772
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,579
um you tend to have a better idea of in

773
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:35,700
in general kind of more consistent

774
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:39,058
better results with your feminized you

775
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,659
know progeny than like a normal a normal

776
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:44,759
breeding where you know you can observe

777
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,039
certain things about a male plant so you

778
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,038
really can't see what it's going to pass

779
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,960
forward whereas with the Femmes you you

780
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,839
know your girl on the left you know your

781
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,940
girl on the right you know it does tend

782
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,099
to kind of give you a a little bit

783
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,700
better of a idea of what you're gonna

784
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,678
get you know on that F1 hybrid you know

785
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,960
absolutely yeah

786
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,600
yeah and I mean so like if you were to

787
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,278
talk to breeders say that we've been

788
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,519
talking about you know in the last few

789
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,679
podcasts in the 80s and touch on the 90s

790
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,139
and stuff I think most of them would

791
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,120
tell you that the most important the

792
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,259
most important plants they had in their

793
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:28,019
rooms uh were the consistent males yeah

794
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:30,359
like once you've found a consistent male

795
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:31,500
back then you tended to cross it to

796
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,839
everything

797
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,720
because you were so stoked I mean a

798
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,759
recent example would be you know uh Matt

799
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,298
found a really good Blue Bonnet male

800
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,158
yeah and he was really happy with it and

801
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:46,980
he was really happy with the with the

802
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,840
traits that it passed on to the progeny

803
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,298
um and because males are so much harder

804
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,439
to find ones that pass the traits you

805
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,418
want

806
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,519
they tend to get used over and over

807
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,980
again it's really hard to move on

808
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,200
sometimes it gets really hard to move on

809
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,058
and so you know you have you can look at

810
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,860
some of these old seed banks like you

811
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:07,740
know Neville stuff or some stuff in the

812
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:09,959
90s and you know they have a they have a

813
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,179
handful of males

814
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,819
um really a handful and they use those

815
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:18,720
handful of males with everything right

816
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,579
right because you know failure you know

817
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,500
failure and means that like you get

818
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,359
something that the customer doesn't want

819
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,319
and that just ends up being a big zip

820
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,319
lock in your fridge

821
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:31,798
you know you know or you you test

822
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,720
something out and you feel like it's got

823
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:35,158
too many harms and it might affect your

824
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,019
reputation even though you think it's

825
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,240
good weed and you don't want to deal

826
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,798
with all the complaints out there and it

827
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,700
ends up being a big zip lock in your

828
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,679
fridge

829
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,860
you know maybe it'll be a project you

830
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,860
want to use later maybe it won't and so

831
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:52,199
you know uh one of the big aspects of

832
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:55,398
this that we want to chat about is that

833
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,798
you know the term breeder is used

834
00:33:55,398 --> 00:34:01,379
Loosely uh and this isn't to diss anyone

835
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:04,379
but it encompasses basically anybody

836
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:07,559
that wants to cross and make seeds

837
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,300
and you know there's some people

838
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,599
um you know there's not very many of

839
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,000
them uh but both uh Caleb and Matt are

840
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,740
two of them that they are actually they

841
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,199
actually do what I consider to be

842
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,779
traditional breeding in the sense that

843
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,118
they take plants that they found from

844
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,159
previous breedings and they use them in

845
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,099
further work

846
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,740
right there's a lot there's a you know

847
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,780
and and everybody listening right now

848
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:36,299
you can have the power to affect

849
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,580
breeding right because the breeding game

850
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,740
right now is crossing a lot of hybrids

851
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:43,858
together and releasing them the public

852
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:46,378
with absolutely no work so a lot of

853
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:48,480
breeders are crossing famous things to

854
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:51,299
it to each other they're giving them a

855
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,280
sexy name and some good packaging and

856
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,679
they're releasing them and they're not

857
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,019
actually popping them themselves okay

858
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,780
and they're not doing any further work

859
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:03,659
which is fine but then what happens is

860
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,000
is that when you take somebody like like

861
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:07,319
you know Caleb who runs a bunch of his

862
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,219
own work

863
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,440
he gets to see what varieties in my

864
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,279
collection breed well and which ones

865
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,980
don't

866
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,260
which ones throw traits that I like and

867
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:22,639
which ones are all over the place and

868
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:27,020
crazy and that knowledge

869
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:29,639
informs the next steps you want to make

870
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:32,759
you know so for instance

871
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,799
um you know uh Caleb has a a plant uh

872
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,400
they call t-1000.

873
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,160
right uh which is uh you know it's it's

874
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,800
a named cut from uh from one of his

875
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,679
lines I believe it's Urkel and TK

876
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,619
correct yep triangle Kush times purple

877
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,799
Urkel triangle Kush times purple Urkle

878
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,400
and he you know it was found in in Hunts

879
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,260
of that line and you know I I saw on his

880
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,019
Instagram and he's told me and stuff you

881
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,760
know he's reversed that he's taken that

882
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:05,820
cut and he's used it in further work

883
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,640
that was one of my that was my one of my

884
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,079
buddy tiger Farm selection uh from you

885
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,338
know up there in Portland

886
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,019
sure yeah from my work yeah so it you

887
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,639
know sometimes sometimes it's stuff you

888
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:20,280
find in your own work sometimes it's

889
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,500
stuff your buddies find in your work

890
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,160
um but you know he Caleb liked that one

891
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,039
enough that he's now doing further work

892
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:30,960
within his own lines and so the most

893
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,759
effective and the cheapest and the most

894
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,880
profitable way to grow seeds right now

895
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,040
sadly is to make the cross give it a

896
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,380
name give it some cool packaging and

897
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,579
sell it and never do any further work

898
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,000
yourself

899
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:47,400
uh that's a pretty profitable path the

900
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,679
other path which is you test and you

901
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,480
grow rooms full of your own stuff and

902
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,940
you try to look for traits amongst that

903
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,380
stuff that you want to keep working with

904
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,720
um that's a lot more sustainable

905
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,720
breeding because it gives you the

906
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:02,279
ability to you know do multi-stage

907
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,559
breeding which is real what real

908
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,019
breeding is really but it's time

909
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,599
consuming and it's costly and it takes a

910
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,460
while and you've actually done indoors

911
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,200
yeah and you have to have a goal in mind

912
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,019
right you know

913
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,639
um and in that regard and so you know I

914
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:19,320
don't know if he's I don't know I don't

915
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:21,420
know if you're are you selling you're

916
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,599
probably selling the T-1000 hybrids now

917
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:27,300
aren't you oh yeah oh yeah you made them

918
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,519
a while ago you know yeah and so you

919
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,440
know he's got you know how many breeders

920
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:36,139
out there are doing two or three or four

921
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,139
step processes yeah not a lot

922
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,980
you look at dog breeders or you look at

923
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,800
fish breeders or you look at corn or

924
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,719
anything else and you know the idea that

925
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,619
you just make hybrids and sell them and

926
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:50,819
never

927
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:52,320
try to like advance in any way is not

928
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,420
normal in breeding

929
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,400
most breeding has goals

930
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,920
yeah some of my favorite projects you

931
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,320
know that I'm working on now

932
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,079
um are the S2 projects where you know

933
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,440
I've you know grown out a hundred plus

934
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,079
you know plants of you know at my s1s

935
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,838
and made selections from those and now

936
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,640
I'm doing S2s

937
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:18,659
um I'm doing back crosses to the moms

938
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:20,338
I'm making hybrids between you know S2s

939
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,980
of the various you know

940
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:25,500
um you know s1s like you know taking the

941
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Urkel S1 cross it to the you know

942
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:31,920
triangle kush or chemdog S1 and you know

943
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,420
kind of making new versions of those

944
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,579
same hybrids that I did with the

945
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,800
original Parent Cuts but you know

946
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,220
they're going to be unique and hopefully

947
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,920
a lot more you know stable in uniform

948
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:46,078
you know versus the previous generation

949
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,280
yeah there's a lot of work you know

950
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,780
going into all that yeah no [ __ ] and so

951
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,000
we could you know maybe one thing we

952
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,940
could talk about and these are these are

953
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,159
also observations from Caleb but he's

954
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:04,380
run out a bunch of

955
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:07,259
um you know uh chem 91 s1s and you know

956
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,960
we all think that it it already is an S1

957
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,540
and what leads us to think that is the

958
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:17,460
lack of ver of variability in the line

959
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:20,279
right it passes potency it passes looks

960
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,800
that look very similar to it or there's

961
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,839
a small range in there and so you kind

962
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,060
of you kind of get what you get with

963
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:28,619
that right but then he's also done a

964
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,559
thing and I got to go up and see it

965
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:33,858
where he's reversed you know Mendo p and

966
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:37,699
he's grown out a bunch of Mendo PS ones

967
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:40,559
and uh that has so much diversity in it

968
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:42,779
that you know he's made comments to me

969
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,900
in the past where you could give out

970
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,640
seeds s1s of Mendo perps to various

971
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,680
different people and they could make

972
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:52,639
their own selections and the lines would

973
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:55,858
be extremely different from one another

974
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:58,319
there's so much variation in there

975
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:00,900
um you know you know and then

976
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,838
maybe we should make a comment about s1s

977
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,420
because there's so many clone only

978
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,400
Elites and there's not

979
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,740
um there's not lines available of many

980
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,440
of these things anymore most of the

981
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:16,679
stuff that we hold uh in our collections

982
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,159
you only have one cutting of that line

983
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:21,838
you don't have any sisters of it and you

984
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,420
don't have any boys of it you don't have

985
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,219
any way to look within the line and so

986
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,920
one of the benefits

987
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:31,259
um of doing s1s with that kind of thing

988
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,720
is it's really the only way to look

989
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:36,480
within the genetic without another

990
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:39,899
genetics you know genes coming in there

991
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,059
and altering it right so

992
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,300
um you know so that's why we didn't know

993
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:48,539
how narrow the chem 91's gene pool was

994
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,460
until he s-wund it and grew out a few

995
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:53,099
hundred of them and we saw that it was

996
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,920
narrow you don't know how wide Mendo

997
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,119
purple was until you did that and grew

998
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,159
out a bunch of them and you were like oh

999
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,900
my God there's a lot of different stuff

1000
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:06,239
in here yeah and so s1s s1s give people

1001
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,700
selfing gives people an ability to look

1002
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:11,219
through a line when they only have one

1003
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,239
example one female example of the line

1004
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,338
itself

1005
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,039
right yeah and so it's one of the ways

1006
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:21,059
that modern breeders get to save and

1007
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,980
preserve old lines like a lot of famous

1008
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:28,199
stuff that Caleb has run recently like

1009
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:31,380
Mendo purple or snow or Trinity or chem

1010
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:34,919
91 or you know Urkel or you go down the

1011
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:38,280
list and if you don't S1 it it's really

1012
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,260
hard to see what's in it by itself you

1013
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,000
can outcross it to other things and you

1014
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,680
can see what traits that are dominant

1015
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,838
that pass to the children and out

1016
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:49,259
process but if you really want to look

1017
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,940
within a line most seed lines today you

1018
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,020
know most clone only is are that they're

1019
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,039
clone only

1020
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:57,599
that's all you get so and so a lot

1021
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:59,820
I'm sorry to interrupt a lot of these

1022
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,380
steps for it you know Consulting you

1023
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,200
know they're they're all cuts that are

1024
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,180
you know as you well know you know Mendo

1025
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,819
purpose is over you know you sprouted

1026
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:11,098
that seed over 20 years ago you know and

1027
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,460
a lot of these cuts are 30 40 years old

1028
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,320
so if we don't you know stash away some

1029
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,780
S1 seed in that fridge you know before

1030
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,180
it's too late before those cuts you know

1031
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:24,060
disappear

1032
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:26,699
uh yeah we'll lose those genetics

1033
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:28,739
on that tangent are you gonna do redo

1034
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:31,500
the the old Betsy are we gonna make

1035
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,419
another attempt at it I want to see real

1036
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,579
old bull rider stock pulled out of those

1037
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:41,159
s1s my my problem is is I don't I have I

1038
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:44,039
only have rooms that are three four and

1039
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:47,098
six so you know

1040
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,320
um it's hard doing some of these

1041
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,740
I I wish I had like some single light

1042
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,660
rooms to do these things right yeah yeah

1043
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,459
because then it wouldn't be so much of

1044
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:59,578
an expense too

1045
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,740
you know yeah yeah every time every time

1046
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,300
it fails yeah for sure and that might be

1047
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:06,059
that might be something good to talk

1048
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,680
about is that it's pretty amazing how

1049
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:11,099
much cool stuff we have to work with

1050
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,259
these days considering like most most

1051
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,920
normal breeders from other walks of life

1052
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:20,400
would laugh at The Limited selection

1053
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,380
pool we pull from uh how many plants how

1054
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,900
many plants we get to run to make the

1055
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,180
Next Generation selections

1056
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,920
um you know uh prohibition and things

1057
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:32,279
like that have made a lot of breeding

1058
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,159
happen especially in America inside so

1059
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,720
inside means you have electricity you

1060
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,940
have a lot of lights you have the cost

1061
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,358
money it's time all this different stuff

1062
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,059
and so most breeders have a million

1063
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:47,519
ideas in their head the ones that are

1064
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:51,139
passionate about it and their ability to

1065
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:54,480
realize those ideas is quite Limited

1066
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:57,838
you know uh you might have a fridge full

1067
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,539
of of ideas and passion projects and

1068
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,940
whatever but right almost breeders you

1069
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:05,519
know you have to sell enough stuff while

1070
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:09,599
you're doing your passion to fund the

1071
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:11,039
passion part right right right so for

1072
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,780
instance you know when I was doing a lot

1073
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,039
of breeding in the late 90s and early

1074
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,579
2000s

1075
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:20,639
it was a terrible financial decision uh

1076
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:22,079
because I wasn't selling any seed I was

1077
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,659
just giving it away to friends and it

1078
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,760
was just for my personal and back then

1079
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,259
cannabis was super expensive

1080
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,180
well at least other people made money

1081
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,920
off your [ __ ] yeah well but whatever but

1082
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,139
that's fine but it's just a matter of

1083
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,059
it's just a matter of like most people

1084
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:38,400
back then weren't willing to take a four

1085
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:40,679
lighter when you could get you know when

1086
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,480
weed was 4 500 a pound or something yeah

1087
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,519
and instead of getting six or eight

1088
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,760
pounds of sellable cannabis out of that

1089
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:51,000
four lighter to get thousands of seeds

1090
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,640
that you you know uh you know didn't

1091
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,719
even have an outlet for you know and

1092
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:56,699
that's another thing that we should talk

1093
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:00,059
about too for a second is the fact that

1094
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:02,578
most seed breeding in America did not

1095
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,039
have an American Outlet to be able to

1096
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,720
get it to the public

1097
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:08,639
right so there was a lot of private

1098
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,199
breeding going on and there was a lot of

1099
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,879
like you know there was some passion

1100
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,578
going on and different things like that

1101
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,818
but the Public's asked access to it was

1102
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:19,859
Tiny yeah in the 90s and in the early

1103
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:20,579
2000s which is when I did most of my

1104
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:22,559
stuff

1105
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:24,119
I don't think there was American small

1106
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,400
American seed companies that were

1107
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,800
getting it out you would you would have

1108
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,358
to make them here send them over to

1109
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,079
Europe and then they would have to send

1110
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:33,078
them back to here

1111
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:38,699
there was companies that's why like

1112
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:41,578
certain Americans partnered with

1113
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:43,980
Europeans dude worst decisions I ever

1114
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:45,660
made in my life over there you know lots

1115
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,500
of American breeders think that way you

1116
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:51,719
know uh I mean for instance in the 90s

1117
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,579
um you know uh the blueberry stuff DJ

1118
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:56,639
Short you know he partnered with sag

1119
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:58,079
Martha first and then Dutch Passion uh

1120
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,900
doesn't sound like he was very pleased

1121
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,060
with either one of those things but

1122
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,680
um you know it uh it at least allowed if

1123
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,880
you didn't partner with somebody in

1124
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,338
Europe

1125
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,619
nobody had access to your stuff the

1126
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:13,380
forums changed it a little bit because

1127
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:15,720
it at least allowed private DMS and some

1128
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,000
and some low-level trading and stuff but

1129
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:20,459
even like yeah even Matt back in the day

1130
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,519
I mean you know you you would have a web

1131
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,838
address that had the Netherlands you

1132
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,460
know I'll comment on that real quick

1133
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:28,078
back in the day I get this question all

1134
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,000
the time the only reason that I have a

1135
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,619
DOT NL address it wasn't because I was

1136
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,079
going to get more traffic because of it

1137
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:36,660
obviously nobody types anything.nl if

1138
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,599
you live in the US but back then it was

1139
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:41,460
just a just one more step to keep people

1140
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,200
from looking at me in the U.S and and

1141
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,480
nowadays it's irrelevant so it's funny

1142
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,500
when people still Americans use dot NL

1143
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,960
because they think it's some kind of

1144
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:52,199
special thing but but really you know

1145
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,818
the the IG era and you know the Forum

1146
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:55,980
the forums a little bit and then

1147
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:58,259
Instagram and then loosening laws and

1148
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:02,219
stuff it allowed a lot of very small

1149
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,920
time private breeders to be able to uh

1150
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,719
to get out there you know um and there

1151
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,200
was some people back in the day 20 years

1152
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,539
ago uh when you know when Caleb and Shaw

1153
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,118
and some others and I first met

1154
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,380
um at some Harvest parties and such you

1155
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,460
know the people that were internet

1156
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:24,838
famous back then were like Vic high and

1157
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:28,380
uh DJ Short and you know the uh the you

1158
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:30,059
know The Brothers Grimm and the c99 work

1159
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,680
um and they well they got famous because

1160
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:33,420
there was there was such a there was

1161
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,940
such a limited pool

1162
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,220
right it was like it you know there was

1163
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,019
some there was a few Canadians

1164
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:42,179
um there was a few Americans it got

1165
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:45,000
famous on the forums but there wasn't

1166
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,338
now it's like anybody can you know can

1167
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,079
breed seeds in their closet or a bedroom

1168
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:50,940
or something and they can have an IG

1169
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,560
handle and they can get their work out

1170
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,480
there and they can spread their work to

1171
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,059
friends and they can so test grows and

1172
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,519
people can see pictures and so now it's

1173
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:02,099
become it's become a lot more common

1174
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,259
but 20 years ago

1175
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:06,300
um you know uh the vast majority of

1176
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,700
breeders I knew in Mendo and Humboldt

1177
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,099
and stuff were private you know unless

1178
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:14,039
you met them you had no way of getting

1179
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,660
access to any of it like zero you know

1180
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,179
if you were in North Carolina or

1181
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:20,159
Illinois or Colorado or something like

1182
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:21,960
that like you weren't going to meet the

1183
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,019
people in the Triangle or the people in

1184
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,420
Santa Cruz or the people wherever

1185
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,480
um and so I you know the combination of

1186
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,338
reversals and the combination of you

1187
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,400
know Instagram and some other forms of

1188
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:39,358
communication really exploded the small

1189
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,039
seed breeder yeah in a way that never

1190
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,559
happened before

1191
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,838
and I don't know I don't even know that

1192
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:47,880
you know people would even know who CSI

1193
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,858
or Riot would be without those two

1194
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,400
innovations they still don't know who

1195
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:56,759
Riot is but it's all right

1196
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,400
um you know we're about let's see four

1197
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,880
uh 50 minutes in so if you want to start

1198
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,740
doing some questions that are uh uh you

1199
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,300
know if you want to start answering any

1200
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:07,799
Caleb we could do that or if you want to

1201
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,800
talk anymore on the breeding topic we

1202
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,619
could do that I'm okay with whatever

1203
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:18,359
all right well I can tell you dude that

1204
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:21,358
uh uh questions for you predominate the

1205
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:22,739
questions this week so I'll try to do

1206
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,619
every week

1207
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:27,838
um to be honest yeah even even the weeks

1208
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:30,539
that you're not here uh there's a bunch

1209
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,880
of stuff that people want to for us to

1210
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:37,800
ask because they know you

1211
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,000
um so maybe uh you know let's see let's

1212
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,060
talk about

1213
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,059
um

1214
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,480
here's a basic one what was your very

1215
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:47,578
first cut

1216
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,318
and what what what is one of the cuts

1217
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,640
that you could say you hold closest to

1218
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:52,199
your heart amongst your current

1219
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,838
collection

1220
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:58,078
well my very first cut

1221
00:49:54,838 --> 00:50:02,460
um was a Northern Lights from my dad and

1222
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:05,280
uh he he gave he gave me that cut in in

1223
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,940
uh in 94.

1224
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,800
um

1225
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:12,480
and I had that one all the way up until

1226
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,140
I think 2002 and then stupidly lost it

1227
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,960
um

1228
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:18,480
but uh the the closest thing to that

1229
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,059
anymore is like chem number chem dog

1230
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,920
number four you know yeah that stuff is

1231
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,838
very similar to the old Northern Lights

1232
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,280
I got from my dad

1233
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,099
um

1234
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,319
as far as favorites go I I always talk

1235
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,539
about it you know just just in case

1236
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:35,759
anybody has ever come across it but you

1237
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:38,759
know my dad also gave me uh around the

1238
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,000
same ERA this Uriah cut and I mean that

1239
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,940
one is still one of my favorites and I

1240
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,219
think it might be possible to recreate

1241
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,980
something like it with like say a pine

1242
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:53,338
tar Kush a bit of OG Kush and maybe

1243
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:57,539
something super super just Piney lemony

1244
00:50:53,338 --> 00:51:00,539
blah blah blah even more so than OG yeah

1245
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:02,058
I don't know but uh as far as what I

1246
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:07,139
have

1247
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:10,260
uh still I mean I love uh you know the

1248
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:12,239
purple Indica that you know my good

1249
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,119
buddy Fletch you know got in the early

1250
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,979
2000s and I'm pretty sure that cut dates

1251
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,838
back to the 80s

1252
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,780
um yeah you know up there up there in

1253
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:24,179
Portland and Washington and all that

1254
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,300
um but that one's that one's extremely

1255
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:28,799
unique but then again uh you know you

1256
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,740
already know I'm a fan of the purple so

1257
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,760
I absolutely you know love francis's

1258
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:37,818
Mendo purple I mean not those

1259
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,819
um

1260
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:43,559
and then uh you know uh you know I've

1261
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:47,039
I've had Urkel for damn near 20 years

1262
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:49,079
now and you know she she's she's a tried

1263
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,619
and true favorite so if I lost any of

1264
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:55,920
those three I'd be a little bit upset

1265
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:59,039
yeah I'll take the next one because it's

1266
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,260
super simple uh can you please confirm

1267
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,599
the timeline for super skunk

1268
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,859
uh I can it's real that one's really

1269
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,019
easy

1270
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:09,179
um it was released by Neville in the

1271
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:13,380
final year that he owned the seed bank

1272
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:16,500
outright uh so super skunk was released

1273
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,800
to the public in the 1990 the seed bank

1274
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,099
catalog uh he took a maple leaf Indica

1275
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:27,240
uh which is supposedly called uh Afghan

1276
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:30,300
T and he crossed that to one of uh Sam

1277
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:33,118
skunk man's skunk lines and he said that

1278
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,700
put the funk back in the skunk

1279
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,460
um and it became a it had a it had a

1280
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:41,399
great name it had a great look uh it

1281
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:44,818
became super popular in the 90s

1282
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,039
um so super skunk was uh when people

1283
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:48,659
talk about oh I had you know mid 80s

1284
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,300
Super Skunk or whatever I'm not saying

1285
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:54,659
that there wasn't skunk Aromas out there

1286
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:57,720
but the actual Super Skunk name came

1287
00:52:54,659 --> 00:53:01,199
about in the 1990 uh uh seed bank

1288
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:04,500
catalog uh this one is for Caleb it's a

1289
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:06,719
pretty good question uh do you feel that

1290
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,119
males have a place in modern cannabis

1291
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,919
breeding or a reversals the future and

1292
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,720
why

1293
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,059
oh I absolutely do

1294
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:18,539
um I'm I've never been one of those

1295
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:21,059
types to rule out anything so I think

1296
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:23,338
there's a place for feminized seeds and

1297
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:25,740
you know feminized breeding and I think

1298
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:28,078
there's just a value as valuable a place

1299
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:33,539
for regular breeding

1300
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:35,760
um so absolutely I mean you know I I

1301
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:39,058
started out doing just as much regular

1302
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,240
work as feminized work I just didn't

1303
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:44,160
really capitalize on selling you know

1304
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,259
much of the regular work because it kind

1305
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,420
of just took an aside because you got to

1306
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,339
select out all those damn mails yeah

1307
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,338
right yeah

1308
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:54,719
um the next question I'm actually not

1309
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:56,699
going to have Caleb answer I'm just

1310
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,139
going to make a joke about it and it's

1311
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:00,299
nothing against it's a great question

1312
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:02,519
but could Caleb please talk about

1313
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,460
interesting things he learned from any

1314
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:08,960
or every line he selfed so you're gonna

1315
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:13,079
have to wait for Caleb's 10 10 volume uh

1316
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,480
Opus on every line he self because uh

1317
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,640
he's constantly uh selfing things over

1318
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,338
the last 10 years or so and that's such

1319
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:21,900
a that's a that's uh we could just talk

1320
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:24,420
for hours

1321
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,760
um there's just dozens of cuts that he's

1322
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,858
done that to at this point so it's a

1323
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,240
little too wide it is a good question

1324
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:36,838
but boy it really is a novel

1325
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:38,578
um I will say I will say I take uh

1326
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:40,920
pictures

1327
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:43,920
um and you know they help with mental

1328
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,380
notes on more or less every single S1 I

1329
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,838
grow so I'm I think I'm headed up to

1330
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:52,680
about 2 million pictures strong as far

1331
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:53,759
as you know the the S1 S1 pictures are

1332
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:56,519
going

1333
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,400
I'll ask this one again because it got a

1334
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:01,800
lot of votes are you gonna try or

1335
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,358
continue to try to reverse the Irene

1336
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,859
Kush

1337
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,739
um

1338
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:11,639
I don't know I mean yeah when you get

1339
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:13,139
when you get 20 s1cs from half a half of

1340
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:14,759
a light

1341
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:16,739
yeah

1342
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,440
that's a little

1343
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,000
and and also I don't know if people know

1344
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,300
but

1345
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,460
um the the Irene you know for half a

1346
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,720
thousand watt light produced 20 seeds

1347
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:33,240
but the the the triangle push uh that

1348
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:36,058
got the side pollination from that in

1349
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:40,679
the bed next to it produced like 750

1350
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:42,599
seeds so the pollen was viable it just

1351
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:45,239
didn't pollinate itself

1352
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,000
yeah very interesting yeah so and that's

1353
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:50,759
an interesting statement too and that

1354
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,619
um even when people get viable pollen uh

1355
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,839
there's some cuts out there's some cuts

1356
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:56,280
out there the Mac would be one

1357
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:59,099
um there's some others that Matt could

1358
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,960
talk about that you have a viable pollen

1359
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,200
and it pollinates everything around it

1360
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,300
just fine and it doesn't pollinate that

1361
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,799
female plant very well at all there's

1362
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,200
several plants that have very few

1363
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,119
pistols on them and the pistols don't

1364
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:15,779
seem to be doing a very good job of

1365
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:18,059
transferring that that pollen grain to

1366
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:21,059
um where it needs to go to fertilize the

1367
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:24,180
egg and create a seed so there's some

1368
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:26,339
interesting stuff in that uh this is

1369
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:29,219
another really good question for Caleb

1370
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:31,679
and I think uh it's pretty valuable I'm

1371
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:34,379
interested to hear inspectus speak on

1372
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,838
growing large populations in relatively

1373
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:44,000
small spaces

1374
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:47,699
um I mean ideally I like to do

1375
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,500
no more than 36 plants per light when

1376
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm growing large populations of like

1377
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,159
feminized seeds out

1378
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,280
and you know I'll do that in a four to

1379
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,440
six K room so you know I'm doing 100 to

1380
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,040
200 plants generally

1381
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,838
um

1382
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,119
it just it just gives you a better

1383
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:04,920
better idea of you know what's in that

1384
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,400
genetic pool

1385
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,500
um I have done like single light you

1386
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,200
know rooms where I pack in like 80

1387
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,358
plants you know under the one light and

1388
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,639
I flour them out you know at you know

1389
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:21,119
four or six inches tall whatever

1390
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:24,179
and uh I mean you know

1391
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,700
for for anybody limited on space I mean

1392
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:28,440
that's an excellent way to go I mean

1393
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:31,739
especially if you're doing them in like

1394
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,659
small six inch pots where you know you

1395
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:37,318
can make selections out of that larger

1396
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:39,659
pool you know and uh then you can pull

1397
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,880
them out and you know

1398
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:44,699
um you know re-vege them and you know

1399
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,640
actually have you know have fairly

1400
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:49,739
heavily selected stock to work with so

1401
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,139
you know you don't have to grow your

1402
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:54,058
plants out in a five gallon pot or 10

1403
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:55,920
gallon pot or whatever you don't have to

1404
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,319
grow big to know what you want you know

1405
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,338
yeah I mean if you're looking for

1406
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:05,818
potency uh smell flavor

1407
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:08,880
um you know any of the the really main

1408
00:58:05,818 --> 00:58:10,980
criteria you don't need just big plants

1409
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,200
I mean if you're expecting them for

1410
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,579
structure or hemp maybe you need a

1411
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:18,058
little more room right

1412
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:20,339
yeah so I'll add to that I'll add to

1413
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:22,260
that as well uh Caleb has a little bit

1414
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:25,318
different style than I do and and that

1415
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,420
he grows uh small seed plants like that

1416
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,460
fairly tightly packed together and just

1417
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,338
so people know when he's talking about

1418
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,500
doing 36 plants a light

1419
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:36,838
um that generally it's it's on like a a

1420
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,818
SL you know one of those uh old tables

1421
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,818
like a four and a half by four and a

1422
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:44,159
half kind of area so it's kind of a six

1423
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:47,519
it's kind of a six wide you know six

1424
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,318
deep type of scenario there

1425
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,420
um if you're I used to do it slightly

1426
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:53,579
differently than that

1427
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,099
um I would I would grow out a bunch of

1428
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:58,680
seed I would take cuttings from that

1429
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,480
seed uh as soon as multiple cuttings had

1430
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:02,338
rooted I would ditch the seed itself

1431
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,798
because I found when you were growing

1432
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:06,420
regular stuff the seed energy I didn't

1433
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:07,920
want to know what it did as a seed I

1434
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,780
wanted to know what it did as a clone

1435
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,880
because sometimes that can be different

1436
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,559
and I wanted to see its growth structure

1437
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,720
as a clone

1438
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:17,880
um and what do you mentioned is is that

1439
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,739
when you grow up things too big and you

1440
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,079
flower them and all of a sudden you get

1441
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:24,779
10 or 12 pounds or something and you

1442
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,940
have a lot of boof uh or at or average

1443
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,980
not every not everything is is a home

1444
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:32,220
run you know even among lines that

1445
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,920
produce great plants there's still a lot

1446
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:36,959
of you know and so then you end up with

1447
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,838
a lot of ants so what I would do is

1448
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,358
somewhat similar to him in that I would

1449
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:45,960
throw away the seed plant and then I

1450
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:48,358
would pack tables with you know four to

1451
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,880
six inch tall cuts and I would flower

1452
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:53,219
the cut because as Caleb just mentioned

1453
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,220
if I got a half ounce or three quarters

1454
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:58,199
of an ounce or an ounce off a plant and

1455
00:59:56,219 --> 01:00:01,500
I got to see what the cola looked like

1456
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:04,199
there that's all I needed you know yeah

1457
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,760
you know and and you you would get

1458
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:07,858
enough of the Terps you'd get enough of

1459
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,140
the smell you could you know if you have

1460
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:13,500
a quarter seven to ten grams to smoke

1461
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:15,239
that'll give you enough indication that

1462
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,400
you need to

1463
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:20,639
um that you can go back and grow some of

1464
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,260
those selections uh in a larger in a

1465
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,900
larger scenario grow more of them grow

1466
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,880
them bigger see there see their um

1467
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:31,200
because that way if you get a bunch of

1468
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,119
bunk it's only 5 to 14 grams a bunk per

1469
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,039
per plant you know and you get enough

1470
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,980
and that's what you need to start doing

1471
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:39,838
in order to really run through numbers

1472
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:42,900
uh in that regard and and have it only

1473
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:45,358
take up so much space the other issue

1474
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,920
that happens and you know I have a

1475
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,078
different method than Caleb but it's a

1476
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,900
universal problem is when you start

1477
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:54,119
growing out large numbers to test and

1478
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,460
you don't want to lose something you end

1479
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:58,440
up needing to keep backups

1480
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,659
of the things you're flowering so you

1481
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:03,000
don't lose them yeah right there's

1482
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:06,118
basically two methods you can either

1483
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,179
keep backups which is time consuming and

1484
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:11,640
takes up a bunch of space in your veg or

1485
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:13,679
you can start pulling if you grow in

1486
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:15,298
pots you could start pulling out small

1487
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,798
pots of things that you think are

1488
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:19,199
amazing when they're only part of the

1489
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,940
way through flowering and then revert

1490
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,858
that's kind of a European method and

1491
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,420
kind of and start reverting them back to

1492
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:27,480
veg

1493
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,099
um you know uh but you know it's you

1494
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,500
know it's a real issue

1495
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,180
um because you know it's happened to

1496
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,420
Caleb talks to me about it all the time

1497
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:40,199
is that you know uh you know I grew a

1498
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:42,000
room of 240 plants and my two and my

1499
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:43,798
three favorites two of the cuttings

1500
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,838
didn't make it by the time I realized it

1501
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:49,199
was my favorite yeah

1502
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:51,119
you know and so trying to save copies

1503
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,759
that you can go back and actually deal

1504
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,140
with and the space involved is a real

1505
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,960
pain in the ass

1506
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:59,159
for lack of a better way to put it uh it

1507
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,960
takes up you know you want to do a big

1508
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:04,879
hunt and you want to keep that thing

1509
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,880
around that means you got a big bench

1510
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:15,298
with not so on uh taking cuts off of the

1511
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:17,579
seed plants and growing the the cut the

1512
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:19,980
cuttings versus the seed plants because

1513
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:22,680
seed plants will never give you an

1514
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:25,019
accurate representation of what that

1515
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:27,179
clone is going to become past the seed

1516
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:29,639
stage so there's really I fully agree

1517
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:32,098
there's no reason to grow the seed

1518
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:35,279
plants themselves when you're just

1519
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:37,680
selecting for future you know you know

1520
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,900
clone stock that's that's going to give

1521
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,000
you the best yeah ones don't have a Tap

1522
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,039
Root you grow a bunch of seeds they can

1523
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,960
be taller they can be lankier they can

1524
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:48,420
have some more life energy in different

1525
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,699
ways in them than the Clone and since

1526
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,680
you only get one shot at the seed that's

1527
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:55,919
why a lot of people like back in the day

1528
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:58,019
would want to grow seed outdoor because

1529
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,940
the Vigor contained within a seed plant

1530
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:03,780
would give you could give you a larger

1531
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:06,900
plant uh a bigger plant than a clone um

1532
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:09,599
there's some famous clones my Maui cut

1533
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,460
does it the blue dream does it uh Green

1534
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,980
Crack does it there's some famous clones

1535
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:17,099
that despite being clones will give you

1536
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:19,559
huge plants outside yeah but if you went

1537
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:22,260
back to the 215 era five or six years

1538
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:24,540
ago a lot of the big giant Gardens you

1539
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:26,220
would see on Instagram uh in terms of

1540
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:29,159
outdoor were all seat

1541
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:31,439
right but you got an eight or nine foot

1542
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:32,879
tall room with you know thousand watt

1543
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,619
lights or something and all of a sudden

1544
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,900
you got some seed energy and the thing

1545
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:39,660
wants to be seven feet tall and you're

1546
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,760
doing bending and trellising and and

1547
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:44,298
corriddling of the plant and it's a huge

1548
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:48,180
pain in the ass you know

1549
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:49,858
so you know that's the you know Caleb

1550
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:52,858
actually has a had a pretty good method

1551
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:55,500
of taking clones off of plants when

1552
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:58,199
they're a couple weeks into bloom

1553
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,960
um which a lot of people wouldn't do

1554
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:02,399
um but in that regard it it the plants

1555
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,318
kind of freak out for a while because

1556
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,940
they're into flower but that's actually

1557
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,920
a benefit because one of the things

1558
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,099
you're trying to do when you're keeping

1559
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,599
clones in a different room for veg is

1560
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:14,760
you want to keep them kind of small

1561
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,798
until you figure out which ones are

1562
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,599
worth it

1563
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:20,338
you might have 180 clones and like you

1564
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,338
only care about six of them

1565
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:26,219
right yeah you don't know which six

1566
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:28,139
so the end when they're in flower it

1567
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:30,539
takes uh you know a good month maybe

1568
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:32,159
even six weeks or so before they start

1569
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:35,358
vegging out of it so you buy yourself

1570
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:39,179
some time keeping them in those Flats

1571
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:44,940
we actually just took uh uh 12 Flats of

1572
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:47,879
clones this week of TK ABC F3 so yippy

1573
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,039
skippy to that [ __ ] yeah the other thing

1574
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,039
I should mention just because Caleb has

1575
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:56,279
told me about it a bunch is that

1576
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:59,579
when you start judging plants on growth

1577
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,140
and structure and weight and Frost and

1578
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:04,318
all that those are good things to judge

1579
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:07,318
on but a lot of the times he finds out

1580
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,380
his favorites end up being some shitty

1581
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:12,298
ass runt that wasn't very impressive

1582
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,519
didn't look very good he wasn't very

1583
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:16,920
happy with it never thought much of it

1584
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:19,318
and then you know him and his crew end

1585
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,659
up testing it which is actually the the

1586
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:23,639
part that matters at the end and they're

1587
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:25,318
like oh man this is special

1588
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,358
but you never would have thought it was

1589
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:29,338
special growing because it just looked

1590
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,858
like a it just looked like a runt it

1591
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:33,298
looked like it was odd it had funkiness

1592
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:35,279
to it it didn't have the greatest bud

1593
01:05:33,298 --> 01:05:38,039
structure and then of course that's

1594
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:42,839
going to be like the tastiest one with

1595
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:44,058
the best time and I'm a huge fan of runs

1596
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:47,699
the screen

1597
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:49,380
in general you know I would say too that

1598
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:51,480
we could mention this because because

1599
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,880
you know he laughed about it but really

1600
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,179
if you look at like Caleb's work with

1601
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:59,519
freak Show or you look at the ABC or you

1602
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:01,558
look at uh you know runts and things

1603
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,019
like that like what he's really talking

1604
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,220
about is like he's a huge fan of

1605
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:07,559
outliers

1606
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:09,779
he's a huge fan of things that are

1607
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:12,119
abnormal things that pop up in a

1608
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:14,519
population that might be rare things

1609
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,440
that you know might not be that common

1610
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:18,539
but then it popped up and you're like oh

1611
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,639
look at that little thing you know what

1612
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:22,679
direction could I take that and

1613
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,659
strangely you know we should mention

1614
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:27,779
this too is that

1615
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:29,460
so I'll I'll stretch it out a little bit

1616
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,079
but if you go into the store any

1617
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,179
vegetable you buy in the store whether

1618
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:34,140
it's a tomato or a zucchini or whatever

1619
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:36,960
else

1620
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:40,139
that thing has been picked

1621
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,119
to grow because it yields well like for

1622
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:43,858
instance let's take a tomato right the

1623
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:47,760
most important thing for a tomato for

1624
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:50,940
tomato Growers is weight color does the

1625
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:53,700
skin break does it rot in transit you

1626
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:56,460
know all these things can you stack it

1627
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:59,159
in transit does it bruise easily all

1628
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,440
these factors are huge taste and flavor

1629
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,558
and texture are way down on the list

1630
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:07,200
right so the whole reason why heirloom

1631
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,599
tomatoes made a comeback is because

1632
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,098
these things actually taste good where

1633
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,440
when people were growing things for

1634
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:14,539
production okay

1635
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,940
um

1636
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:21,000
zucchini anything you name it they're

1637
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:23,338
grown because the producer it it grows

1638
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,039
well for them right it produces a lot

1639
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:27,599
for the space cannabis is pretty unique

1640
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,539
in that

1641
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,640
the stuff that becomes really popular

1642
01:07:29,539 --> 01:07:34,079
became really popular because consumers

1643
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,239
enjoyed it

1644
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:39,720
no one would ever in a million years

1645
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:41,058
pick any kind of OG Kush as a production

1646
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:44,879
plant

1647
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:47,819
viney small buds doesn't hold itself up

1648
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,858
a pain in the ass to grow a weak root

1649
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:52,619
system all those things would prevent

1650
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:54,480
you from ever seeing it in most normal

1651
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:56,280
agriculture because they would eliminate

1652
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,159
it because it didn't have the qualities

1653
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:02,160
needed to be put to scale right people

1654
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:04,500
would want every you'd get blue dream

1655
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:06,838
right because it's a fast-growing

1656
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,420
vigorous thing that yields a ton doesn't

1657
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:11,519
take that long and so cannabis is a bit

1658
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,220
unique in that even like something like

1659
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,319
sour diesel uh Sour Diesel is kind of

1660
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,000
tricky to grow well a lot of people find

1661
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,520
it finicky if you have too many Bud

1662
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,539
sites on Sour Diesel it'll give you a

1663
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:26,040
lot of feathery almost wheat right

1664
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:27,359
um you know there's a lot that goes on

1665
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,539
with that so there's a lot of very

1666
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:34,400
famous strains that have really really

1667
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:37,500
crappy production traits right

1668
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:40,679
you know all kinds of things you know um

1669
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:42,899
you know and so you know so there's the

1670
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:44,759
you know Matt way earlier in the thing

1671
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:47,460
was talking about root structure which

1672
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:48,838
is not a very bred for trait

1673
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,119
um there's certain plants that you grow

1674
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:54,179
in the same room that some plants drink

1675
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:56,039
like crazy and I'll use OG Kush as an

1676
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:58,259
example a lot of OG cushes have

1677
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:01,500
typically weak root systems

1678
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:03,420
they don't grow vigorous root systems so

1679
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:06,600
as a result they can only drink so fast

1680
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:09,239
so as a result they only grow so fast

1681
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,239
so you know that's a consideration too

1682
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:14,338
is that cannabis has been I mean I'll

1683
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,519
tell you guys a funny story really quick

1684
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:19,920
when Skittles first came out uh Skittles

1685
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,620
is notorious for growing slow

1686
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,659
right uh Caleb and I had had a mutual

1687
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:26,880
friend that made an IG post where he was

1688
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:28,920
like you know in in October he's like

1689
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,140
I'm vegging these Skittles for my next

1690
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,940
year's light depth hopefully there'll be

1691
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:36,960
three hopefully they'll be three feet

1692
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:39,178
tall in six months right where Skittles

1693
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,859
might be like winning awards for its

1694
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:43,259
Terps and winning awards for its

1695
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,819
extracts and everything else but try to

1696
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:48,539
get the thing higher than four feet tall

1697
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:51,600
outside yeah it's a slow growing bushy

1698
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:53,278
little hedge of a plant and so my point

1699
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,199
to that is that most of the famous

1700
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,080
strains that people like either for

1701
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,939
their terp profile or their High

1702
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:02,760
wouldn't make the cut in normal

1703
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:05,460
agriculture because they don't have the

1704
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,260
growth traits yeah and it's really

1705
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,520
really difficult because that's what I

1706
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,800
was that's what made me think of it when

1707
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:14,820
I was joking about Caleb's love for runs

1708
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:17,039
is that a lot of times the the freak the

1709
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:19,198
mutant the one that grew short the one

1710
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,359
that was a pain in the ass to grow that

1711
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,039
one's the one that tastes amazing

1712
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,039
that's the one that will get people

1713
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:28,560
excited right and the one that was like

1714
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,600
five feet tall and threw huge colas all

1715
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,760
over it and grew like a champ and barely

1716
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,380
required any work that one ends up being

1717
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,239
a little bit more boring

1718
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,940
right and you're like man I wish I could

1719
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,519
merge those two I'm sure you can talk

1720
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:43,500
about that for a minute Caleb I I swear

1721
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,960
the biggest biggest girls at least

1722
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,060
biggest feminized girls I grow they

1723
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,600
always seem to have a little persuasion

1724
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:52,800
to hang in the balls

1725
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,719
I don't know if you've noticed that but

1726
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,500
the big girls yeah I wouldn't say that

1727
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,500
about me all the time

1728
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:04,260
I got a question for both of you that

1729
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:07,079
that I'll follow up with on after after

1730
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,159
I ask you guys so Hayes brothers and me

1731
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:09,658
and Caleb actually talked about this

1732
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:11,579
yesterday and I think me and me and not

1733
01:11:09,658 --> 01:11:13,379
so talked about it a few days ago uh I

1734
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:16,319
know crybaby was a part of that Hayes

1735
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:19,079
Brothers vintage California Kush 1980s

1736
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:20,960
picture in High Times in the 79 issue

1737
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:24,719
they talk of a new hybrid known as

1738
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,779
c-u-s-h Kush uh in NorCal a cross

1739
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:30,000
between Hawaiian hash plant and Thai

1740
01:11:26,779 --> 01:11:32,219
specifically calling it cush by 79 they

1741
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,219
already knew of Hindu so what the [ __ ]

1742
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:37,500
is this Cali Kush is it pure kush the

1743
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:39,719
picture does look like the Malibu in the

1744
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,340
article they straight up say Afghani

1745
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:44,119
skunk weed it's been driving me crazy

1746
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,119
for 10 years

1747
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,460
Caleb anything

1748
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:52,939
I don't know well

1749
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:57,719
I can make a couple General comments so

1750
01:11:52,939 --> 01:11:59,698
cush is a general term right

1751
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,500
um there's a huge mountain range it's

1752
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:04,678
the second tallest mountain range in the

1753
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:07,020
world next to the Himalayas and it runs

1754
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:08,840
through Afghanistan and Pakistan down to

1755
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,760
the ocean and it's called the Hindu Kush

1756
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:15,179
so uh you know we talked in a previous

1757
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:18,239
podcast about how names are relatively

1758
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:21,658
new and back in the day people talked

1759
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:26,299
about people named things uh per their

1760
01:12:21,658 --> 01:12:30,000
region of origin right oaxacan Michoacan

1761
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:32,579
Panamanian Hawaiian you know various

1762
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,600
various aspects like that they rarely

1763
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:39,719
had names that weren't Regional so Kush

1764
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:42,539
could literally be anything collected

1765
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:45,119
from the Hindu Kush Mountains and the

1766
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:47,100
Hindu Kush mountains could be as low as

1767
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,500
one or two thousand feet above sea level

1768
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:52,079
and as high as five six seven eight

1769
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,479
thousand uh above sea level and some of

1770
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:57,300
these big valleys so

1771
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,619
you know and then secondly to that and

1772
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,560
what peop what he's probably really

1773
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:04,500
asking is that

1774
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,500
there are there are a few plants

1775
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,198
um that popped up and became famous uh

1776
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,579
everybody mostly knows the story but if

1777
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:14,579
they don't

1778
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:17,760
um there's a there's a Bubba Kush line

1779
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:20,640
um and there's a cush line that has

1780
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:23,100
various origin stories but

1781
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:26,760
um is most likely a mix of Northern

1782
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:30,480
Californian and European genetics that

1783
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:33,060
popped up in Florida came to La became a

1784
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,799
craze people got extreme amounts of

1785
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:37,800
money for it and then it became very

1786
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:42,000
popular and so what most people today

1787
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:44,880
know is cush you could classify as TK or

1788
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,260
ghost or that's what most people know

1789
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,840
because that's what became popular

1790
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,239
that's what's been traded on forums and

1791
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,840
traded on IG and everybody else and

1792
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:57,718
bought in clubs and so that's what most

1793
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:00,619
people today know know of as Kush

1794
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:03,658
but that's a lot narrower of a gene pool

1795
01:14:00,619 --> 01:14:06,300
than [ __ ] that came from the Hindu Kush

1796
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:08,399
yeah well right so you go all the way

1797
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:12,119
back to Hindu you go back all the way

1798
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:14,339
back to 1979 and you have Matt and I

1799
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,979
might do a short about this soon about

1800
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:19,619
the hippie hashish Trail but

1801
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:22,799
you have some you have some Euros or you

1802
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:25,800
have some Americans come back from India

1803
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,739
Nepal Kashmir

1804
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:32,340
um you know uh Pakistan or Afghanistan

1805
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:34,379
and they bring seeds back to their buddy

1806
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,579
and they're from Kush

1807
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,219
so

1808
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:41,399
what what date was was that article from

1809
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:43,020
again 79 79 issued they talked of a new

1810
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:46,139
hybrid known as Kush

1811
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,400
okay well you know remember I was

1812
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:50,579
telling you how

1813
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:53,819
um they were hating on humble that back

1814
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:56,100
back in the 70s I think it was I think

1815
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:57,658
it was kind of that same issue they were

1816
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,539
all bitter you know that Humboldt's all

1817
01:14:57,658 --> 01:15:04,259
popular because they're indicas or their

1818
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:07,079
cushes right yeah and you know they they

1819
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,640
were upset that their hazes you know

1820
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:10,920
were getting downplayed

1821
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,500
well you know like we've talked plenty

1822
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,899
of times back in 78 you know that was

1823
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,819
that was roughly the year that pretty

1824
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:20,579
much it seems like everybody around

1825
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:22,738
Humboldt you know

1826
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:25,559
um Trinity all that

1827
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:28,799
have you know we're growing uh Purple

1828
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:31,199
Kush there was a huge influx you know of

1829
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,179
of Purple Kush seed you know and

1830
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:35,219
obviously just like um not so I was

1831
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:37,619
talking about that's that's just Hindu

1832
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:40,158
Kush seed and the purple is of course

1833
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:44,279
the the purple Fino

1834
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:45,960
or purple genotype of that so yeah I'm

1835
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:48,479
I'm almost wondering if they didn't just

1836
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,779
get a hold of some of some of that seed

1837
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:54,000
and incorporate it into their hazes to

1838
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:55,079
kind of you know up up their market

1839
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,479
value

1840
01:15:55,079 --> 01:16:00,119
yeah it's very possible

1841
01:15:57,479 --> 01:16:03,059
and one thing I could add to that is

1842
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:06,000
that in modern breeding today

1843
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:09,659
um that same thing holds true which is a

1844
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
cut becomes famous and everybody breeds

1845
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:15,479
that cut into everything right right

1846
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,579
right so in the last 15 years

1847
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:20,759
um the amount of people that have used

1848
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:23,359
cherry pie Girl Scout cookies

1849
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,940
five or eight different Kush Cuts

1850
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:29,519
Skittles you so you name it if it became

1851
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:32,099
famous and desirable people would blend

1852
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,020
it into everything and so one of the

1853
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:36,179
things you know you see people out there

1854
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:38,880
that are like pumping up their various

1855
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:40,739
hybrids and you know some of the stuff

1856
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,359
you see Caleb do that people might be

1857
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:45,119
like oh why the hell is he working with

1858
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:47,039
ABC that looks weird oh that's funky

1859
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,359
freak show is [ __ ] up too why the [ __ ]

1860
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:52,380
you messing around with that I don't get

1861
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:53,698
it some of it is like honestly with the

1862
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,640
amount of work that's been done with

1863
01:16:53,698 --> 01:16:58,799
cherry pie and cookies and Kush

1864
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,900
what new and exciting do you think is

1865
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,760
going to pop out of that that someone

1866
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:05,698
hasn't already done in the last 10 years

1867
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,920
yeah and if you take two hybrids that

1868
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:10,979
are mostly a mishmash of those things

1869
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:14,219
all smashed up together I'm not dissing

1870
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:16,678
Crossing cushmans with this but what are

1871
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:19,140
you going to find that's not something

1872
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:21,239
that's already somewhat similar to a lot

1873
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:23,640
that's out there it's very hard to find

1874
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:26,519
novel and new and okay so people people

1875
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:28,619
have been ever ever since the name game

1876
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,179
came around and ever since popularity

1877
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:32,219
came around like Caleb was just

1878
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:34,260
mentioning people might be Crossing

1879
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:37,380
these Afghans to their hazes to increase

1880
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:39,420
its popularity right

1881
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,940
people have been doing that for the last

1882
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:45,060
forever but it's increased dramatically

1883
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:48,479
in the last 20 years where it's like you

1884
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:51,179
know uh there was uh I mean this is a

1885
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,158
funny example but there's no cush in

1886
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:56,699
blackberry kush

1887
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:58,379
right in the sense that cush for the

1888
01:17:56,698 --> 01:18:01,319
most part like the reason why people

1889
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,359
added Kush to blackberry kush was

1890
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:05,880
because people wanted to buy Kush

1891
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,979
you know sour gets added to a lot of

1892
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,219
names or diesel gets added to a lot of

1893
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:13,319
names or names get changed because

1894
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:16,439
there's a desire to sell

1895
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:18,658
certain things and then the desire to

1896
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:21,059
feed that market either makes a lot of

1897
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:23,099
breeding happen around a few Select Cuts

1898
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,480
and you're trying to get a hybrid that

1899
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,820
you can call

1900
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:29,698
you know um there's a famous there's a

1901
01:18:26,819 --> 01:18:32,099
there's a good cut up here called doxog

1902
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:33,658
and I would say that it's it's not the

1903
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:36,060
greatest guide it doesn't have very much

1904
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:39,238
uh OG flavor it doesn't have very much

1905
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:41,940
in the way of uh you know the the the

1906
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:43,859
high that I like but it looks like a

1907
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:46,559
traditional Kush

1908
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:48,539
um and it yields like crazy and so then

1909
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,060
people are gonna grow it because it

1910
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:53,158
produces well and they can call it cush

1911
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,960
oh I'm looking for Kush oh well I have a

1912
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:58,439
ton of kush here buy this Doc's cush

1913
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:01,380
right and that's for rare maintenance

1914
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:02,698
yeah I think yeah and so I you know and

1915
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,960
I'm not even trying to diss them or

1916
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:07,799
anything like that that's not the point

1917
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:10,739
the point is that is that you know these

1918
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,900
names get added onto things because as

1919
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:15,238
long as it's desirable and easy to buy

1920
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:17,639
for instance

1921
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:19,919
um you know uh Caleb has become pretty

1922
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,380
famous with his Urkel crosses

1923
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,539
in

1924
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:26,460
04050607 I would say that you know

1925
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:28,920
eventually there was probably literally

1926
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:33,719
thousands of growers in Mendo and humble

1927
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:35,819
that had lavender Urkel Grape Ape uh you

1928
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:38,100
know you name it half a dozen of these

1929
01:19:35,819 --> 01:19:40,679
different cuts to meet the purple craze

1930
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:43,079
and then is the purple craze phased into

1931
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:45,779
the sour craze and the Kush craze and

1932
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:47,880
the cookie craze and the Skittles craze

1933
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:51,300
it ends up like there's like six dudes

1934
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:54,300
that held on to the the Urkel yeah right

1935
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:56,039
but 15 years ago how many people did you

1936
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,239
know in Humboldt that had some kind of

1937
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:00,779
Urkle

1938
01:19:57,238 --> 01:20:03,059
right a lot everybody because it was

1939
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:05,099
everybody because it was popular and a

1940
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:07,800
lot of buyers wanted it which means lots

1941
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:10,440
of people that produced had it and as

1942
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,760
soon as the market shifted so did the

1943
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:14,460
holding of the cut

1944
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,679
and before that before that it was

1945
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:19,859
Salmon Creek big bud and train wreck and

1946
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:22,380
snow and stuff like that yeah sure and

1947
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:24,359
so that's a thing right is that what

1948
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,560
happens is and this is sort of the thing

1949
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:27,960
is that when things are popular

1950
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,239
everybody has it and everybody wants it

1951
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,698
and people want it from their friend and

1952
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,319
as soon as it becomes unpopular the

1953
01:20:32,698 --> 01:20:36,119
percentage of people that are willing to

1954
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:39,439
hold on to Old cuts when there's no

1955
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:43,439
Financial value to it because it's tiny

1956
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:45,000
right and you know uh then you have a

1957
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,259
bunch of people you know now we have a

1958
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,960
bunch of stuff going on in the community

1959
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,900
where most people there's legendary

1960
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:54,420
strains that very few people to relative

1961
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:57,658
to today have actually seen or smoked

1962
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:59,640
and so fakes proliferate

1963
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:01,019
um because they get passed around and

1964
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,360
maybe the person passing it around

1965
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,880
doesn't even realize it's a fake because

1966
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:08,759
he never had it in 1998 so he doesn't

1967
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,260
know right you know and so he's passing

1968
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,699
it around he's like oh I think I have

1969
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,619
real snow

1970
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:16,859
I'm gonna trade you this but he doesn't

1971
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:18,420
know I thought that was real soon I

1972
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:19,979
thought that was real snow it was given

1973
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,560
to me by my buddy who's had it for

1974
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:24,299
forever and he swears it's real snow and

1975
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,280
then you talk to somebody like me or

1976
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,860
Caleb or whoever who actually grew snow

1977
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:30,779
back then or you know someone who or

1978
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:32,519
kale who's held it for a long time and

1979
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:34,019
they're like I'm sorry

1980
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,600
but that's not it

1981
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:39,980
yeah that was a snow was a bad example

1982
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,980
I've never seen a fake cut of snow

1983
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,840
been a bad example but like maybe maybe

1984
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:48,239
the Trinity would be

1985
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,560
would be an excellent example yeah that

1986
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,119
might be an act because people will get

1987
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,560
mad at me because they would give me

1988
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,899
their Trinity and they'd be like oh man

1989
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,460
I gave up the farm for this cut right

1990
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:58,259
and then I'd smoke it and I'd be like

1991
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,079
it's not even a hybrid of it it's it's

1992
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,460
not it like what do you mean I I like I

1993
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:04,500
you don't know what I did to get it and

1994
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,380
I'm like dude I'm sorry it's it's not it

1995
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:09,479
you know and and so there's so there's

1996
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,760
some Cuts where it's like I mean one of

1997
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,198
the things I have no idea what sour cut

1998
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,480
I hold

1999
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,399
um but if I lost it I've collected six

2000
01:22:15,479 --> 01:22:19,619
or seven or eight different sour Cuts in

2001
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:21,719
the last four or five years and none of

2002
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:24,000
them are the are the cut that I have

2003
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,399
yeah which means that like if I lost it

2004
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,100
me trying to find it again would be

2005
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:31,379
would be would be shitty it'd be hard

2006
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,179
right and so that that's what happens to

2007
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,920
a lot of old cuts and then you get

2008
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:37,020
arguments about whether it's real or

2009
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,539
whether it's not real

2010
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:40,800
um and there's a group of collectors uh

2011
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:43,019
you know there's three of them on this

2012
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,520
call right now but there's not that many

2013
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:46,320
people that are willing to hold on I

2014
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,460
have a joke of give me your old and

2015
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:51,119
unpopular

2016
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:54,539
yeah right because you know having a big

2017
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:56,460
mom room is a huge pain in the ass

2018
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:58,319
it's a lot of money it's a lot of time

2019
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,119
it's a lot of cloning it's a lot of

2020
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:04,319
trying to keep plants healthy and bug

2021
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:06,960
free it's a lot of and then you know 98

2022
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,340
of it isn't commercially viable

2023
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,560
they're holding on to it for

2024
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:13,020
preservation you're holding on to it for

2025
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,000
maybe some future breeding you're

2026
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,980
holding on to it because most of the

2027
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,300
stuff that I hold I hold it because I

2028
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:20,158
personally like it

2029
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,920
that's the determining factor I don't

2030
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,899
care what the public thinks but most

2031
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,219
people you know it's they don't have the

2032
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,500
time they don't have the space they

2033
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:30,119
don't have the will uh or they just want

2034
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,738
to hold what's currently popular because

2035
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:33,658
that's what works for them and they

2036
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:35,879
think this is this is how everything

2037
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:37,879
gets lost right I can always get it back

2038
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,319
from my buddy he's got it

2039
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:42,840
that's I wanted to chime in real quick

2040
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:46,380
yep before we get way too far from the

2041
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:48,840
question of the California Kush so

2042
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:52,260
um I was actually given the seats that's

2043
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:54,119
way far from that yeah way far I

2044
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:56,039
apologize to whoever's question it was

2045
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:57,899
we got real far afield there for a

2046
01:23:56,039 --> 01:23:59,399
minute that's what we do

2047
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:01,979
um that's what you do when you're a

2048
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:04,259
[ __ ] nerd you nerd out but uh yeah no

2049
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:06,119
I was given seeds by a guy that was on

2050
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:07,980
the forum's name Walking Man a lot of

2051
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:09,059
people that around back in the day knew

2052
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:11,158
him

2053
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,360
um I I sat on these seats for a long

2054
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:14,219
time and they were labeled Hayes

2055
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:16,139
Brothers California Kush and the reason

2056
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:17,640
I sat on them because I was like what

2057
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:19,980
the [ __ ] is it

2058
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,020
California Ace Brothers they're [ __ ]

2059
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:24,359
Haze you know so I sat on them for a

2060
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:26,340
long time until I came across a High

2061
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:27,839
Times issue that I have and I was going

2062
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,060
through it and I see Hayes Brothers

2063
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,619
California Kush and I'm like what the it

2064
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,840
you know and by this time walking hands

2065
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:35,099
uh or walking dude's dead you know so

2066
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,960
I'm trying to figure out you know what

2067
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,120
are in these things so I did pop them I

2068
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,359
did run them and I would say the closest

2069
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:44,340
thing they look to is what I would

2070
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,719
associate having grown with Hindu Kush

2071
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:48,179
before

2072
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:51,359
um they're stretchier they're not like

2073
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:53,219
OG the buds the buds are dense they're

2074
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:55,738
smaller more golf ball more spread out

2075
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:58,260
it's stretchier that is where the OG

2076
01:24:55,738 --> 01:25:00,359
connection probably ends with the

2077
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,619
California Kush that I have grown now

2078
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:03,359
are they the original ones from the

2079
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:05,460
Hayes brothers who knows that's what

2080
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:07,619
they were labeled but we did fgn those

2081
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,239
and let them out just in case

2082
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:11,519
uh-huh

2083
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:13,500
there you go I want some

2084
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,580
yeah you now you need to grow them so

2085
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:20,060
you can answer the question not

2086
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:22,679
oh all right

2087
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:24,539
oh my gosh

2088
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:27,480
so uh we have a question that's pretty

2089
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:29,100
funny is uh Caleb why when are you gonna

2090
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:31,179
come back and why did you make everyone

2091
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:33,679
wait so long to come on

2092
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:37,199
[Laughter]

2093
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:40,920
oh man I'll answer that one for him is

2094
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:42,299
uh he's real busy you know uh he's got a

2095
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,119
lot of stuff going on part of being

2096
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:47,640
really a prolific breeder is that that's

2097
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:49,500
a lot of work uh it's a lot of work to

2098
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,719
make seeds it's a lot of work to run

2099
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:53,219
rooms and have things come down and

2100
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,840
catalog and

2101
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:57,779
what do you mention the 20 million

2102
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:00,539
pictures that he has on file and answer

2103
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:02,399
and answer be responsive probably on his

2104
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:04,198
website and deal with his life and

2105
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:05,819
family stuff and eat oh I haven't

2106
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:08,000
responded on the website for about three

2107
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:11,158
months apologies to everybody

2108
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,439
so it gets it gets difficult especially

2109
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:14,819
if you're a one-man show and you're and

2110
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:16,439
you're holding on and you're trying to

2111
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:18,779
do a lot of actual work and you're

2112
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:21,000
trying to have a life and friendships

2113
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:23,158
and families and different things like

2114
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,859
that we're really appreciative that he

2115
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:28,319
gave us some time uh he's like one of

2116
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:31,799
our really close friends and we chat

2117
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:34,198
like this all the time about things

2118
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,760
um you know and uh one of one of the one

2119
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:38,219
of the aspects that Matt and I are

2120
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,840
trying to do is that some of the most

2121
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:43,020
knowledgeable people

2122
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,520
are not great at self-promotion

2123
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:46,320
um you know and there's a lot of people

2124
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,820
who are really good at self-promotion

2125
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:51,238
and not that much great at everything

2126
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:53,279
else uh Caleb's kind of the reverse uh

2127
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:55,259
he's really really good at observation

2128
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:57,658
and breeding and he has a long history

2129
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:00,420
of plants and he's definitely a weed

2130
01:26:57,658 --> 01:27:02,519
nerd and has a lot of knowledge in there

2131
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:04,199
um but you know public speaking and

2132
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:08,460
making the time for this kind of thing

2133
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:09,899
can be relatively hard uh you know so

2134
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,760
um you know we're super appreciative

2135
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:13,619
that he came on and we're hoping that

2136
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:17,520
we'll be able to occasionally get him to

2137
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:19,979
pop back in so I would say you know uh

2138
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,440
be thankful he's here and let's hope

2139
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:24,059
that he liked it and uh we'll get some

2140
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:26,819
other subjects that interest them enough

2141
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,440
that he'll pop back on you know I really

2142
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:30,299
want to do a show with Fletcher and

2143
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:31,939
Caleb together I think that would be

2144
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,860
pretty phenomenal

2145
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:36,559
really

2146
01:27:33,859 --> 01:27:39,839
maybe some Bodhi

2147
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:42,420
yeah you know I mean there's uh you know

2148
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,460
both those guys uh both those guys are

2149
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,260
on the same vein you know they're both

2150
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,420
really knowledgeable they both have a

2151
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:50,100
lot of passion for what they do they

2152
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,960
both have a lot of projects they both do

2153
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,000
a lot of hunting

2154
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,980
um you know uh Bodhi would be quite

2155
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,380
interesting because you know he's done a

2156
01:27:55,979 --> 01:28:01,500
lot of traveling uh which is not common

2157
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:03,060
in the modern in the modern times

2158
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:06,479
um you know he's gone to a lot of these

2159
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,800
regions of origin and poked around uh

2160
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,619
and so those are probably some like

2161
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:13,020
really cool stories that he's got in his

2162
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,920
head he is helping us on the hippie hash

2163
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,060
Trail

2164
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,500
um episode we haven't really talked

2165
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:18,239
about it much but we will be doing that

2166
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,340
and Bo's gonna be a major part of that

2167
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:21,839
so yeah we're Clippers uh we haven't met

2168
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:24,000
we haven't we haven't talked about that

2169
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,739
but one of our episode ideas is to sort

2170
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,139
of talk about the hippie hashish Trail

2171
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:30,839
because that's the way that the vast

2172
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:32,760
majority of Afghan seeds actually made

2173
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,440
their way to America

2174
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,619
um I talked about in a previous episode

2175
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:39,719
how all the sativas

2176
01:28:36,619 --> 01:28:42,359
free seeds came with every kilo of Bud

2177
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:44,760
that came to America but yeah Afghans

2178
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:46,799
they had hash and hash didn't contain

2179
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:48,239
seeds generally speaking on rare

2180
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,239
occasions it did but for the most part

2181
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:54,658
no and so we talked about it a little

2182
01:28:51,238 --> 01:28:57,658
earlier uh but you know

2183
01:28:54,658 --> 01:28:59,399
um in Humboldt where Caleb is from you

2184
01:28:57,658 --> 01:29:01,979
know and Mendo and stuff like that in

2185
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:04,738
the Central Coast of California it seems

2186
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:08,279
like there was Afghans in the early and

2187
01:29:04,738 --> 01:29:10,619
mid 70s but the wave where most Growers

2188
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:14,279
that were tied into people really

2189
01:29:10,619 --> 01:29:17,698
started seeing them was more 77 78 79

2190
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:20,099
80. that's when the waves of Afghan

2191
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:21,899
seeds really started hitting America and

2192
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,120
and hitting groups of Growers and

2193
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:26,698
getting passed around

2194
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:28,979
um and I believe that's mostly due to

2195
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:32,099
the hippie hashish Trail and people's

2196
01:29:28,979 --> 01:29:34,859
travels to the Far East and so there's a

2197
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:37,139
lot of interest I think in talking about

2198
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:39,719
that uh and we're gonna have an episode

2199
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:42,119
upcoming uh that goes way more into

2200
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:43,560
depth on some of that hashish and some

2201
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:46,439
of the traditions and some of the

2202
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,719
travels and how that all worked and even

2203
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:51,779
just I mean just how difficult it was to

2204
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:54,539
even get over there uh and and trip

2205
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:57,238
around uh it wasn't in the 60s and 70s

2206
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:58,500
it was not easy uh to get to that part

2207
01:29:57,238 --> 01:30:01,259
of the world

2208
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,779
uh and to move around it's far it's you

2209
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,699
know different issues today so yeah far

2210
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:08,158
more dangerous a lot more dangerous yeah

2211
01:30:05,698 --> 01:30:09,779
we've um sadly America's been at war in

2212
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,359
that part of the region for quite some

2213
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:14,399
time so people's opinions of us have

2214
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:17,339
changed a bit and it's certainly a

2215
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:19,259
little sketchier uh with the Taliban and

2216
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:21,960
some of the other various aspects that

2217
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,940
go on in Afghanistan and Pakistan but

2218
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,859
you know that region is one of the few

2219
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:27,960
regions as well where there's still a

2220
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:31,079
lot of traditional farming going on of

2221
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,000
cannabis yeah um so it's good in the

2222
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:35,399
sense that it's a resource it's sad that

2223
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,319
it's hard to get to for us but at least

2224
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:38,939
it's still there and there are some

2225
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:41,399
people that are traveling around there

2226
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:43,799
that are uh starting to ship some seeds

2227
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:46,379
back to Europe and to America from those

2228
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,900
regions and maybe people will find some

2229
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:51,600
cool stuff in this more recent wave of

2230
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:53,399
you know heirloom cushes or heirloom

2231
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,400
Afghans and stuff like that that are

2232
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:57,839
getting bred over there so we'll see

2233
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,099
all right so we need to do some

2234
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,560
housekeeping

2235
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,000
uh for calebs anybody who's interested

2236
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,260
in grabbing Caleb seeds I've seen a lot

2237
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,639
of comments about that you can find them

2238
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,260
on Speakeasy you can find them on his

2239

I don't know how long have we been

2249
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:26,099
talking it's pretty wide-ranging

2250
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:27,000
discussion hour and a half hour and a

2251
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,100
half

2252
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,899

questions uh to get to if your question

2258

didn't get answered maybe it'll get

2259
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:48,480
answered in the future podcast uh maybe

2261
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,979
whole episode idea

2262
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:55,679

2267
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:06,179
there chat uh I think we're doing movie

2268
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:08,520
night tonight where we [ __ ] sit and

2269
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:10,020
watch movies together or TV shows just

2270
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:12,480
dick around but we also talk about

2271
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:14,639
cannabis stuff extensively and put a lot

2272
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:17,339
of my catalogs online and a lot of my uh

2273
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:19,380
collection of historical stuff so pretty

2274
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,239
much anybody can access the part of our

2275
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:24,840
patreon and I'm putting up nudes of

2276
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:26,218
Caleb in the same folder oh my gosh and

2277
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,079
then two things real quick just because

2278
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:29,460
I see questions I see multiple questions

2279
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:34,380
about it

2280
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:37,380
um I gave my my headband cut to Caleb to

2281
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:41,039
breed with he's already released a few

2282
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:43,020
lines off of it it's it's not very well

2283
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:45,840
spread out in the community yet and so

2284
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:48,719
since he's so prolific at breeding and

2285
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,000
he has such a customer base my main goal

2286
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:54,119
was to get it out there so he's done

2287
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,738
some chemd he's done some TK uh there's

2288
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:57,179
you know there's potential more work

2289
01:32:55,738 --> 01:32:59,218
that he's going to do with it as long as

2290
01:32:57,179 --> 01:33:00,420
it ends up being worthwhile and he likes

2291
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:02,279
it

2292
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:05,219
um and so that's that and then someone

2293
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:08,039
asked him some questions about Mexico uh

2294
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:12,000
you know Mexico is super close uh

2295
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:15,060
unfortunately the Mexican uh the Mexican

2296
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,738
weed is controlled a lot by cartels and

2297
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,100
there's a lot of violence associated

2298
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:21,839
with it so it's not so much like the 70s

2299
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,460
anymore where you can kind of go down

2300
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,400
there and like hang out with regular

2301
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:29,039
farmers and maybe get seeds it's a

2302
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:31,198
little bit more sketched than that the

2303
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,658
violence has been quite extreme for the

2304
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:36,119
last 10 years

2305
01:33:32,658 --> 01:33:38,638
and so while Mexico does have a large

2306
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:41,340
and diverse population of cannabis down

2307
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,800
there and we hope that some more of it

2308
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:46,079
comes our way it's not as simple as it

2309
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,440
was decades ago to go down there despite

2310
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:52,619
how close it is and poke around and get

2311
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:55,198
access to it I think there's anything

2312
01:33:52,619 --> 01:33:57,599
really worth

2313
01:33:55,198 --> 01:34:00,479
um getting in Mexico anymore just with

2314
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,860
the influx of uh you know European

2315
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,319
genetics

2316
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:06,658
I hardly doubt it man cartel would have

2317
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,099
been trying to increase production at

2318
01:34:06,658 --> 01:34:09,420
some point you know what I mean like

2319
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:12,239
they're not they're not stupid that's

2320
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:13,679
their main export other than meth so so

2321
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,718
that might so that might be something

2322
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:18,779
just real quick that will end it on is

2323
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:21,060
that uh sadly one of the you know I I

2324
01:34:18,779 --> 01:34:23,819
talked about how it's very difficult for

2325
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:26,940
us to penetrate Afghanistan and Pakistan

2326
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:28,738
these days that might be a benefit

2327
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:31,259
um because it's keeping their lines a

2328
01:34:28,738 --> 01:34:35,359
bit more pure uh some of the European

2329
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:35,360
lines have infested Jamaica

2330
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:41,599
Morocco and some of these other regions

2331
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:43,679
yeah even Colombians

2332
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:46,500
especially Colombia some of these

2333
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,880
regions have been you know have you know

2334
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,319
some of these you know Morocco

2335
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,659
especially because it's close to Europe

2336
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:53,340
you know uh they used to have a lot of

2337
01:34:51,658 --> 01:34:54,960
traditional cannabis they have a lot of

2338
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:57,480
DNA they have a lot of different

2339
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,520
European seed banks got Super Lemon Haze

2340
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,500
now yeah stuff like that that they bring

2341
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,780
down there and breed

2342
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:06,719
um so there's a lot of regions of origin

2343
01:35:03,779 --> 01:35:09,359
that have been polluted for better for

2344
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:11,279
worse uh by these other things and

2345
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:14,039
you're not going to go to Jamaica and

2346
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:16,319
find some 25-week Lamb's bread anymore

2347
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:18,238
you're not gonna it's not as easy to

2348
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,639
find stuff in Morocco it's not as easy

2349
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:23,099
to find stuff in Mexico

2350
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:25,679
um that's part of the issue is that the

2351
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:28,380
you know global trade has good and bad

2352
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,719
parts and in the 60s and 70s a lot of

2353
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:32,699
these regions were untouched and they

2354
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:34,319
just had what they had from their region

2355
01:35:32,698 --> 01:35:36,839
and now there's been a lot of

2356
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:38,639
cross-contamination

2357
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,739
um and so yeah you know no one's going

2358
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:43,199
to Morocco looking for Super Lemon Haze

2359
01:35:40,738 --> 01:35:45,299
but sadly that's what they might find

2360
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:47,698
you know or they might find some LA

2361
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,719
Confidential or whatever over there you

2362
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:49,698
know

2363
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,859
um

2364
01:35:49,698 --> 01:35:55,019
those Farmers just want to make money

2365
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:57,479
yeah so

2366
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:59,159
um you know I think uh you know we could

2367
01:35:57,479 --> 01:36:01,619
answer a lot more questions and we could

2368
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:04,319
