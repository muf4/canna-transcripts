00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,599
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,439
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,160
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,278
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,600
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,960
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,359
of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
cookies we are the traditional Market

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,600
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,238
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,358
has become much bigger than myself

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,230
welcome to the Cannabis underground this

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,920
is the

25
00:00:54,229 --> 00:01:01,919

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
revolution

27
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,959
welcome to BR Syndicate I'm Matthew with

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960
my co-host thousandfold and today we're

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,199
going to be talking about uh what are we

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,118
gonna be talking about thousand we're

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,520
talking about Harvest and post Harvest

32
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,359
and we have the combined indoor and

33
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:23,118
outdoor Crews or at least some of them

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:27,039
from both Crews um so just to get us

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:29,560
started we wanted to talk about when do

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
you harvest and maybe we can start with

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,840
little

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,079
when do I harvest

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,599
um so I'm a little bigger scale at this

40
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:45,158
point um Harvest really needs to be

41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:48,759
coordinated with a crew to help

42
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,719
Harvest and

43
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,399
also sometimes dry space comes into play

44
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:59,478
um so like on a on a light depth if if

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,478
it strains I know and and everything's

46
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:02,280
kind of

47
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,118
normal

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,320
um I don't really look at Triads too

49
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,719
much anymore with with the strains that

50
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:13,759
I know I just kind of know when they

51
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,840
look finished um and

52
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,239
uh generally I really like to let things

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,360
finish fully um like I don't want to

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,159
take you know Sour Diesel before Day 70

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,760
and if I can let it ride to 77 I

56
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:33,120
will

57
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:37,519
um but uh there's other things to take

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,000
into account sometimes um like you know

59
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,120
if you got your Harvest crew together

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,080
and it's day 74 like fine that that

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,719
works for me um uh but with like shorter

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,080
shorter flowering stuff like 60 days

63
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:56,199
nine weeks um I I got to know the strain

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,480
and and I and I want to make sure that

65
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:02,560
that bud is fully

66
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,318
swollen at that that point um I will

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,080
look at Triads if I don't know the

68
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,759
strain and as long as I see him turning

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,760
cloudy and I'm looking for mold you know

70
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,120
if I'm not seeing mold I'll let it ride

71
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,079
if I see start seeing like mold start to

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,000
come in then it's like okay like there's

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,159
a point of diminishing returns I need to

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,560
take it um so who cares if you're

75
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:29,158
harvesting right right moldy buds it

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,039
doesn't matter so um I mean those things

77
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,199
I take account and then on like the

78
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,280
full-term

79
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,798
stuff um kind of same thing like I know

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
it's like you know beginning of October

81
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,959
it's time to start checking for mold

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,000
depending on weather and when you're

83
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,840
taking in large harvests

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,199
um you know I'll take the colas first

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,200
because those are the first things that

86
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,560
are about to mold get those hanging let

87
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,679
the rest of the plant continue to

88
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,158
develop um and I can kind of just start

89
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,280
start like mowing through the garden

90
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,798
like that by taking tops the first thing

91
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,640
and then giving the rest of the plant

92
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,079
another week or 10 days or depending on

93
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,000
dry space um this this year was a bit

94
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,879
more he hectic than usual with all the

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,798
rain we got in October mold really

96
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,120
started to set in at some point and so

97
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,918
it was kind of like it it's molding it's

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,360
ready it's it's not going to get any

99
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:30,359
more ready and uh and so that that comes

100
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,800
into play and just filling up the dry

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,800
room getting it all down filling it up

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,319
again getting it all down filling it up

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,639
again like you don't quite get to like

104
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:44,120
pick and choose your day based

105
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,639
on you know whether you want cloudy

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,759
heads or Amber or or what you know um

107
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,160
you kind of got to go in space and labor

108
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,199
available um within range like if you

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,720
cut early you're just shooting yourself

110
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,840
in the foot with quality you're shooting

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,880
yourself in the foot for weight um you

112
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,719
got to wait for weight and uh so it's

113
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,159
It's always important not important not

114
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,080
to get like trigger happy with taking it

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,520
down uh but at the same time like

116
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,918
sometimes you can't wait as long as you

117
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:21,318
wanted to because you're not going to

118
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,839
have space or there's rain coming

119
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,439
or you know maybe you're not going to

120
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,638
have a harvest crew you know on certain

121
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,279
days so I think I don't know man

122
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,478
probably not the answer that most of you

123
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,719
wanted but that's like the reality of it

124
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,758
is at a at a certain scale you don't get

125
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,919
to pick and choose down to the day I

126
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,520
mean if I had it a perfect world I would

127
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,279
have unlimited dry space and I would

128
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,478
Harvest all my all my harvesting would

129
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,000
be done at

130
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,800
night

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,639
and you know that's just not how it

132
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,400
works I think it is really important to

133
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,079
point out that beyond the kind of like

134
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,599
ideal finishing time for plants there

135
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,198
are all these other competing pressures

136
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,000
uh that are possible as well whether

137
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,080
it's like whether your dry space is

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,360
ready or yeah I I'm I'm curious to hear

139
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,598
about other people's like logistical or

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,919
administrative pressures outside of like

141
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:18,719
ideal finishing time as well yeah I

142
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,240
think like on the completely opposite

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,280
end of that I uh like with the endoor

144
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,360
stuff I do more of like you know small

145
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:31,439
Perpetual hobby kind of situation and so

146
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,800
um I have just like 2x4 ENT that I dry

147
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:38,079
in and um I just kind of you know I

148
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,240
don't know I look at other things like I

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,959
look at the Tricom sometimes but more so

150
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,840
now I kind of look at just like if the

151
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:49,719
plant looks like it's done like and I

152
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,359
just mean kind of like um is it drinking

153
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,199
slower you know does it I mean you know

154
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,759
there's there just comes a point like I

155
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,079
think like when you run when you're

156
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,720
running if you're running the plants

157
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,959
enough you get to a point where you just

158
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,080
kind of see that like they're not

159
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,878
getting better you know what I mean like

160
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,959
there's like a point where if you just

161
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,479
run them longer like they can go longer

162
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:14,000
and they might get more Coler or

163
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,959
whatever but like for me personally like

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,918
um I just kind of look to when the plant

165
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,560
looks like it's kind of drinking slower

166
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,120
and um yeah I don't know I I just think

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,199
you just kind of get like a Vibe for

168
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,399
when the plant feels done I know that's

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,000
like kind of a vague answer but like

170
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,318
there's a point to it where it's like

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,360
you need to just run the plants a few

172
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,639
times and just get an idea of like what

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,639
when it's in a good

174
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,720
range yeah I'm kind of in a similar

175
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:47,319
position um I usually tend to take most

176
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,319
things nine to 10 weeks on average and

177
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,039
then other things like they'll get

178
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,879
bumped to like 12

179
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,759
weeks um I'll obviously like look at the

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,158
flower tricomes I have like a little

181
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,520
jewelers loop nothing too fancy

182
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:09,038
um but I try to go for majority milky

183
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:13,878
with like I don't know 25%

184
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:17,318
Amber um or sometimes I'm just like lazy

185
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,319
and let things go an extra week longer

186
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,598
or kind of just want to see where things

187
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:27,000
go um but yeah there I guess I kind of

188
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:31,478
just look for sence um and then as ER

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,200
mentioned um kind of um when like the

190
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,559
plant stops drinking or stops benefiting

191
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,000
from any additional feed and

192
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,958
whatnot but yeah that's kind of some

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,038
some of the general cues that I look at

194
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:47,278
for Harvest local I wanted to ask you

195
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,559
real quick um what are the just

196
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,799
generally speaking the recognized like

197
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,239
signs of

198
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,240
sence um so I kind of like a lot of it

199
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,879
kind of starts with like General like

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,799
fading and stuff like that I like

201
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,559
um some of the lowers will begin to fade

202
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,919
yellow but like the remainder of the

203
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:09,078
leaves will sometimes depending the

204
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,559
genetics shift colors and whatnot um

205
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:15,239
your plants will stop drinking I mean in

206
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:18,078
my experience um I haven't particularly

207
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,799
seen it in like the case of like either

208
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:24,599
outdoor growing or seed making but like

209
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:29,439
I don't know the the plant just

210
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,720
doesn't like really want much more it

211
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,720
kind of

212
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,879
seems there's no additional bulking

213
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,599
either um uh from my experience after a

214
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,519
certain point I guess very generally

215
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,959
speaking the principle is that it's it's

216
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,240
like metabolism is slowing right

217
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,439
overall

218
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,159
yeah yeah yeah you can actually you can

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,680
definitely see it in the

220
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,600
plant because it's like an open dialogue

221
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,519
with your plant you've been talking with

222
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
it and communicating with it all year

223
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
and when it starts slowing down you you

224
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,079
can definitely you can definitely catch

225
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,239
on to

226
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:11,239
it well to to ern's point

227
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,560
like if if you have a have that and to

228
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,680
your point too Kush like if you have

229
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,919
that relationship with it like the only

230
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,639
thing that really matters when it comes

231
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,519
to harvest is the end user and what high

232
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,360
they're trying to get from it what the

233
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,278
brain chemistry is and where they like

234
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,079
it at the end because I mean like there

235
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:29,240
used to be the old tale of like oh it

236
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,120
better be like 50% Amber 50% milky you

237
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,639
and then learn Amber means some

238
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,078
degradation with CBN or whatever else

239
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,759
comes along with that and you know maybe

240
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,199
people prefer like all Amber you know

241
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,639
maybe they like that side of it maybe

242
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,600
their brain chemistry maybe that makes

243
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:48,320
them happy and less anxiety but um yeah

244
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't as I've gotten older and further

245
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
into this I kind of realized that like

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,679
the whole idea of an exact flower time

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,879
on anything is kind of

248
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,638
arbitrary yeah it's very subjective

249
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,360
there is no right perfectly right or

250
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,480
perfectly wrong answer for it it's very

251
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,440
very

252
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,399
subjective yeah and for me my like back

253
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,360
back when I was growing 12 or 14 clones

254
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,399
of the same thing growing that I like my

255
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,360
my Harvest used to be dictated on what

256
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,320
the weather was going to do like if I if

257
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,440
I looked at the weather and I saw six

258
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,360
days of an inch of rain coming for each

259
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,480
day and specifically with the cream the

260
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
cream could be cut at 55 at 57 days and

261
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,120
people would still love it everybody

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,399
everybody loved that stuff but I really

263
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,200
liked pushing it to 65 to 66 days where

264
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,159
it really shined and put on a little bit

265
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,800
of purple and and got its finishing but

266
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,838
um and then as the market changed and

267
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,359
I'm not growing one clone outdoors and

268
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,639
and going for maximum weight I started

269
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,519
growing varieties and just letting them

270
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,200
run to their full extent not not

271
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,078
worrying about the weather and my

272
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,120
Harvest change and I picked up a tool

273
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,000
that I really enjoy using and uh if

274
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,078
people have it in their budget it's just

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,320
a live view microscope um battery

276
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,159
operated or you can charge it and it has

277
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,519
a 9 inch monitor a little 9inch screen

278
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,078
monitor that you can tote around you

279
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,120
could take it down to the garden and

280
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:22,599
live view microscope your your resin in

281
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,360
bigger profiles not just uh you know you

282
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,199
can you can zoom in really far you could

283
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,560
look at it from a pullback perspective

284
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:31,958
but that that tool to me looking

285
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,958
looking at the plants maturity is always

286
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:38,838
always been something that I use for my

287
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:40,759
harvesting but lately like from from my

288
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,199
perspective and what I've looked at and

289
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:47,078
seen in my garden is I noticed the onset

290
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:49,559
of of Amber tricomes usually start on

291
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:52,719
the sugar leaves on the outside and work

292
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:54,799
their way in towards the butt and you

293
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,600
know some years workload gets heavy I'm

294
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,000
not going to microscope every plant I'm

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,120
not going to inspect every single bud

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,480
and a lot of the times I'll wait for

297
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,278
that uh March that that forward movement

298
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
of Amber tricomes to just touch the butt

299
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,159
so when I can see that it's Advanced up

300
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,199
the Sugar Leaf and is now there's a

301
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,159
little bit of Amber showing on the

302
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,078
actual flower itself that's that's just

303
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,519
kind of a baseline for something when I

304
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:20,679
want to

305
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,839
harvest but before when I was being

306
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,638
super meticulous about it um yeah like

307
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,560
I'd think something that I would aim for

308
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,600
is like 75% cloudy uh maybe just a

309
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,638
little bit clear and a little bit Amber

310
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,480
and then before before all that advanced

311
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,360
Tech and microscope and people

312
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,480
would say you know 50% Amber 50% cloudy

313
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
that was like as Matt was saying when I

314
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,519
first started growing outdoor that's

315
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,479
what everybody on the forums was saying

316
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,759
that's what that's what other people

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,560
were saying and um it was just kind of a

318
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,958
general rule of thumb and

319
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,919
then yeah I'm trying to think of an

320
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,879
example where I I think my so I got got

321
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:04,838
a brother who grows and he likes letting

322
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,600
his resin go Amber and he he feels like

323
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,720
it gives him a lot more couch lock a lot

324
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,399
heavier a lot more medicinal value out

325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,839
of taking care of he's a he's a faer so

326
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,078
he's got aches and pains that I couldn't

327
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
even begin to

328
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,919
describe and uh you know working with

329
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,399
horses all day so he wants something

330
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,278
heavy hitting that knocks him out

331
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,240
something narcotic so he likes letting

332
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,519
his plants Go full Amber and uh as a

333
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,720
testament anytime I smoke his stuff it's

334
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,159
it's strong Stone stuff every single

335
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,440
time and that could be due to him

336
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,120
letting his plants mature pretty full

337
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,800
you

338
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,078
know and it it goes back to subjectivity

339
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:43,639
you know what you want uh changes for

340
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:43,638
for when you should

341
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,480
Harvest yeah so potentially this

342
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:54,879
decision can be quite a complex decision

343
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,839
um right because you have all these

344
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,198
like subjective preferences your

345
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,360
relative experience with those

346
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,719
particular plants you have these other

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,440
competing pressures whether or not

348
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,199
they're like environmental for you

349
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,759
Outdoors um or they have to do with like

350
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,078
your workers if you have a team of

351
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,839
people working for you and when they're

352
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,799
available and when you have the right Dy

353
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,120
space and it is really interesting I

354
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,838
didn't really think about it from that

355
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,720
point of view like that practically when

356
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,240
you are making the decision there are

357
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,800
all these other practical things that

358
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,039
come into play as

359
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,399
well yeah yeah and you can always make a

360
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:31,439
plan but executing the plan it almost

361
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,759
never seems to work out the way you want

362
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,759
it especially when it comes to

363
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,600
harvest you know you always you always

364
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,399
think it's going to happen this way and

365
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,879
it doesn't lay out in the exact perfect

366
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,360
uh way that you'd wish it P you know

367
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,838
something comes up you know family

368
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,639
member shows up or something happens on

369
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,160
the farm and everybody has to stop

370
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,639
everything and you know well your

371
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,719
workload for that day is done and you

372
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,278
know yeah you got that now you got to

373
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,000
all compile that on the the next day and

374
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,078
when you're dependent on the scale of

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,919
your operation sometimes you don't have

376
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,198
that extra day is worth of work to to to

377
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,759
offer especially with weather impending

378
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,559
and and other

379
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,240
issues did anyone want to speak to this

380
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,838
idea of like preference when it comes to

381
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,318
harvest and like particular experiences

382
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,800
where you've divert from that like sort

383
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,278
of guideline of you know Amber trike

384
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,519
balance you know are there particular

385
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,159
plants that you any of you grow that

386
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,159
like you know that's not GNA be the

387
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,000
case um specifically last year I had a

388
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:40,359
black cherry soda seed from a random

389
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,240
seed company that I just tried and about

390
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,959
week eight before like she still had

391
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,799
another week and a half to mature I'm

392
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,278
looking at it and I'm smelling the plant

393
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,599
and I'm looking at the bud structures

394
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,439
and I'm looking at the resin content and

395
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,240
I can kind of just tell it's not going

396
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,480
to be flower that I'm going to smoke and

397
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,799
that I'm going to enjoy and what I'll

398
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,360
what I did is I I checked the checked

399
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,439
the live scope of it saw that the resin

400
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,599
was all clear and I turned it all into

401
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,078
fresh frozen I had a buddy who who would

402
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,240
take it and turn it into live resin and

403
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:13,399
uh I could have let it mature further

404
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,558
but the i i the tur profile that it had

405
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
and its immaturity before it had its

406
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:21,038
chance to fully mature was was decent on

407
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,000
its own but I could tell that the flower

408
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,838
wasn't something that I would desire or

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,759
something that I would be able to get

410
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:31,720
rid of so I I you know took it all and

411
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:35,720
turned it into live live resin and it

412
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,120
was it it it it got consumed way more

413
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,200
actually you guys got to try some of

414
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,678
that at the uh at the party that was

415
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,720
some of that from that plant the live

416
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,759
resin that you guys got to try that uh

417
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,279
that and that was a a shot call that I

418
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,839
made a plant instead of letting it

419
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,119
mature fully I took it early and and

420
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,558
used the live resin off of it and it was

421
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,719
much more enjoyable that way than I

422
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,839
think the the actual flower would have

423
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,440
been I mean that's a that's a good

424
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:05,519
General point about like maybe knowing

425
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,759
what ideal final form um the product

426
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:12,079
will take like you know are you uh if

427
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,038
you are doing extracts does it change

428
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,678
this

429
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,480
decision right for example broadly like

430
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,120
do any of you who are you know into

431
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,400
Rosen and stuff have any thoughts on

432
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:27,319
this does it change your decision or I

433
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,880
don't know washing or

434
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:32,200
anything

435
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,559
all of my all of my concentration has

436
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,000
been like low scale like really small

437
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,440
personal use so and I'm still just kind

438
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,798
of messing around with it playing around

439
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,960
with bubble bags so I don't have any I

440
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,798
don't have any personal expertise on it

441
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,360
um yeah we need peaches here yeah I was

442
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,158
just gonna say we need we need peaches

443
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,839
to come and talk

444
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:57,159
about fill in fill us in on that

445
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,519
yeah I was just going to say I don't I

446
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,240
don't make any special hashes but I

447
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,759
assume there's a reason why like people

448
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,200
cut their plants down extremely early

449
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:10,798
like you know to get like nice white

450
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,038
hashed and stuff like that I don't know

451
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,918
because that looks pretty um but yeah

452
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,158
I'm not

453
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,679
entirely I'm the last person to talk

454
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:27,440
about that stuff I I do I have been told

455
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:29,759
by uh Rosen Rosen makers to uh I've been

456
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,519
told both by people making rosin like

457
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,558
don't cut it down early cut it down when

458
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,599
it's

459
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,879
mature because they don't care as much

460
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,279
about color they say color doesn't

461
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,840
really matter on the quality and then

462
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,839
other people are like it does matter

463
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,038
let's let's chop it 10 days early let's

464
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,079
chop it a week

465
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:51,960
early um because it'll be lighter

466
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:55,158
colored and that'll help sell it because

467
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,240
for some reason I guess the custies want

468
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,760
you know that clear you know really

469
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,960
light colored Ros

470
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,759
as opposed

471
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,519
to um any anything that's darker or more

472
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:10,679
Amber um again I'm not really a Rosen

473
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:13,400
smoker so I don't have a preference but

474
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,679
mentioned that she didn't think it was

475
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,440
good like she felt like it was purely

476
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,919
like a fashion thing or like a you know

477
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,400
just what people expected kind of

478
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,520
thing I definitely in small scale

479
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,679
personal use like kind of stuff but you

480
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,519
know like I I have the press and stuff

481
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,480
so I've done a bit of it and like just

482
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,599
from like the general Vibe of people

483
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,000
like talking to people that are really

484
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:41,480
into rosin it seems like

485
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,400
um uh the harvesting for color and stuff

486
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,400
is literally just like something that

487
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,120
has been pushed by like big companies

488
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,000
like seven1 labs and stuff like that

489
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,798
that you know make rosin and sell it to

490
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,640
you know dispensaries and stuff like

491
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:01,240
that and that generally you know good

492
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,960
plants make like like stuff that you

493
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,000
would want to smoke in flow is what you

494
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,000
want to make rosin out

495
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:15,399
of yeah I had a i in two years ago I

496
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,679
grew some lemon parties and I had uh s1s

497
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,480
I grew five of them and I had two that

498
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,400
were fairly similar they weren't

499
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,360
identical but side by side they were

500
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,240
pretty hard to tell apart and uh I let

501
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:32,359
one of them go like 70 60 70% Amber uh I

502
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,000
let it mature and I let the other this

503
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,959
it sister plant next to it I pulled it a

504
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,640
little bit earlier and uh I remember

505
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,038
pressing rosin from both of those plants

506
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,120
and continually getting people telling

507
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:48,400
me that I should put a warning label on

508
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,918
the rosin that I let go 80 to 90% Amber

509
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,000
triome it was I continually had people

510
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,520
saying hey man that that stuff is too

511
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,640
strong my husband was passed out on the

512
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,519
couch for two hours drooling on himself

513
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,038
you know I had I had people telling me

514
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:02,240
that that I should warn them about

515
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:04,879
giving them that specific rosin from

516
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,558
that so uh there's a little anecdotal

517
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
evidence about you know choosing to let

518
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,000
the resin mature a little bit longer for

519
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:17,159
some of the concentrates but that being

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,759
said I see more people want the either

521
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,440
live resin or fresh press uh stuff

522
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,480
that's a little more battery little more

523
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,080
white has stronger tur profiles people

524
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,720
seem to be more interested in that than

525
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,798
and rosin that packs a heavy punch at

526
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,519
least from in from what I can

527
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:39,679
see I put myself in that category um

528
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,720
usually like when I'm assessing up until

529
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,200
like maybe even I don't know a month or

530
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,120
two ago I would find myself assessing

531
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,798
extracts why their scent like their

532
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,759
inherent scent of just smelling them you

533
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,558
know like oh this one's super tury but

534
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,079
as I found out a lot of these like the

535
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,678
scent is only like released once you

536
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,119
activate it like some of them are real

537
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,159
tur but you just don't inherently smell

538
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,000
that and I think since it's like most

539
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,400
people's first experience with hashes

540
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,480
you pick it up the first thing you do is

541
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,840
smell it that's probably why that's a a

542
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,558
big deal and seeing it obviously like I

543
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:15,000
guess they make machines now to strip

544
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,158
the color out of hash which blew my mind

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,720
that that's a thing yeah and so they're

546
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,919
I think they kind of push this narrative

547
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,400
that it's like clean quote unquote that

548
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,600
if your hash is um clear like white like

549
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,440
lighter colored that it's cleaner um and

550
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,000
I I don't know you can interpret clean

551
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,558
however you want to you know I'm not

552
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,159
really sure what that means but um yeah

553
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,158
I mean I think the general Vibe is like

554
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:44,919
if you're going to make hash like grow

555
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,278
your plant and to its maximum potential

556
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,759
make it the best that you can and that

557
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,960
will make the best concentrate that you

558
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,960
can

559
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:59,240
make the old theory of in out

560
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,039
yeah well it feels like we're sort of

561
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,679
like rounding out this section on like

562
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,759
Harvest timing I wanted to ask if yall

563
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,880
had any good stories about you know that

564
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:15,558
whether like uh horrifically early

565
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,559
horrifically late why I don't know

566
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:25,278
anyone like a a bad a early Harvest or

567
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:29,360
like a forced late Harvest or something

568
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:31,480
like that yeah I guess so yeah

569
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,398
uh and was there anything you could do

570
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,360
to like you know

571
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:40,479
uh mitigate it in any way or I don't

572
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,519
know soften the blow or I'm so used to

573
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,278
like early seed Harvest as opposed to

574
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,720
just like flower or late flower harvests

575
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,240
like getting the jump on harvesting

576
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,679
seeds was always my issue like you see

577
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,720
them forming and sometimes they look

578
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,559
more mature than they actually are and

579
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,000
like you know in the early days I would

580
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,440
just pick seeds off the top and look at

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,798
it be oh it's Brown mature okay hack and

582
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,519
then like you hack it all down and

583
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,960
there's like three mature ones on top

584
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,879
and the rest are just but as far as

585
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,200
flower it's kind of different

586
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,080
yeah yeah I mean say definitely had some

587
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,880
bad

588
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,599
Harvest what's your worst do you think

589
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,200
like out of all the uh the the worst

590
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:25,839
Harvest was a long time

591
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,720
ago um it was due to a cold room and I

592
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,720
had switched from soil with

593
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Coco and it was the W the winter came it

594
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,480
was my first run in

595
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,440
Coco uh the plants were off the floor

596
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,159
but I the room was still just too damn

597
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,320
cold at night

598
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,840
especially and then it wasn't heating up

599
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,398
like it had been in the summertime

600
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,038
during the day so

601
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:55,199
uh and it was also the first winter run

602
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:57,919
at this place so yeah it the roots were

603
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,278
just cold the plants were just like all

604
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,799
leaf with like you know just

605
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:05,359
skinny skinny narrow

606
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:08,038
buds um real

607
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:11,119
bummer um real but my first that was my

608
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:13,440
first bad Harvest where like yield was

609
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,959
like crap quality was

610
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:21,200
crap um it was also my last Harvest at

611
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,840
that place I bet there for like a year

612
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,558
but yeah I mean lesson learned

613
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:31,319
um and uh moved on but

614
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,079
like yeah man environment was super I

615
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:36,558
mean I was I was fairly new to growing

616
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,879
at that point I was still maybe like six

617
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,599
years into growing now maybe like five

618
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,080
years four years but it was my first

619
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,798
time just dealing with bigger rooms and

620
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,439
and different envir this was a basement

621
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:52,440
grow so it was just cold in general so

622
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,200
like it would never you know the lights

623
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,440
were on at night but it still wouldn't

624
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,960
get that warm in there and then the

625
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,840
lights were off all day and it would

626
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,798
just be freezing in there yeah even

627
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,439
during the day so I don't know that was

628
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:07,639
my worst Harvest ever for sure I mean

629
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,159
that's not like

630
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,559
super obvious to a lot of people like

631
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,880
that you know if it gets super cold your

632
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,879
on your roots that you know it's going

633
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,960
to get a lot more leafy and thinner

634
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,200
shitty Buds and you know a lot of us are

635
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,558
used to dealing with the heat you know

636
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,240
right and that's what I was dealing with

637
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,158
All Summer in that place and working on

638
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,519
heat issues and trying to keep it cool

639
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,960
during the night cycle and cool during

640
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:35,639
the day or during the um light cycle and

641
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,200
man uh yeah cold cold Roots um I would

642
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,080
say is more important than ambient

643
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,919
temperature is your root temperature

644
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:46,398
yeah they're just not GNA metabolize

645
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,440
nutrients they're not going to dry out

646
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:52,199
as fast easier to overwater sure um just

647
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,919
all those things it's it's more

648
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,919
important and I found that even to this

649
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,159
day in in in the green houses is I don't

650
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,960
care how cold it as outside as much as I

651
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,720
care about the root

652
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,600
temperature and uh and getting that up

653
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,720
and and figuring out how to manipulate

654
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,158
that it's it's it's massively more

655
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,880
important than ambient temperature as

656
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,519
long as you're talking cold now if it's

657
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,519
too hot that's different yeah like an

658
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,038
ambient temperature definitely matters

659
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:22,880
but as far as coldness goes like I mean

660
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:25,640
it can be 55 degrees ambient temperature

661
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,960
but if the roots are at 45 you're

662
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,519
you know of the questions I get

663
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,759
uh in DMS about harvesting are can I

664
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,599
save like that my room is like 109 you

665
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:40,158
know can I do anything with these Buds

666
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:43,959
and I'm just like like you know

667
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:47,278
like it's kind of hard done yeah yeah

668
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,319
yeah yeah I was just gonna add that uh

669
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,240
ever since I transitioned to LEDs that's

670
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,599
like the first time I had to like

671
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,599
actually warm my grow space at night

672
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:01,678
especially like here in the Midwest

673
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:03,398
where it gets like cold um and

674
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,559
yeah I don't know it just it comes with

675
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:07,558
its own set of problems and and that's

676
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:09,558
one of them that I noticed as well is

677
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,759
just like having to keep the rooms warm

678
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:15,839
at night relatively speaking so you

679
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,480
don't run to those into those issues

680
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:22,119
yeah I've never lived anywhere where I

681
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,919
needed a a heater ever in a grow so that

682
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,038
growing in a cold situation to me would

683
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,320
be totally counterintuitive like I'm

684
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,519
always trying to make it cooler you know

685
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:33,439
so what's a dangerous or what would you

686
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,120
all determine to be a dangerous root

687
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,000
Zone temp a little Hill you mentioned

688
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,599
like 45 is that already like quite

689
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,480
extreme is there

690
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:43,918
a yeah that would be way too cold it

691
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,880
might vary in green between greenhouse

692
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,200
and

693
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,120
indoor I might be able to get away with

694
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,880
a little bit cooler um in a greenhouse

695
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,719
as long as I'm getting good

696
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:59,559
sunlight but I I would say like

697
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,159
55 55 is is good enough I mean you could

698
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:07,398
probably work with 50 but 55 and then

699
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:11,360
like in summertime it'll be over 60

700
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:14,639
65 um and that's that's fine I think I I

701
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,038
really don't check conversion too much

702
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,960
say what I just had to do a Celsius

703
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,720
conversion okay that's that's quite oh

704
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,240
yeah sorry I can't help you with that I

705
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,240
got we're Americans we don't use those

706
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,278
silly

707
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,839
things Fahrenheit all day

708
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,679
do you remember how like when people

709
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,278
wanted during the the first purple craze

710
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,759
like people really like were like

711
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:38,880
feeding ice water to their Roots yeah

712
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,599
yeah I remember that with ice and

713
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,039
Koolaid people pouring Koolaid during

714
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,000
the flush that's during the flush last

715
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:50,119
couple

716
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,519
weeks um I never did that um

717
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:57,879
but I did it work uh you know not really

718
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:00,319
not particularly um it had to be like a

719
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,440
per I was trying it on like OG Kush and

720
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,480
stuff like of course it wasn't going to

721
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,919
go purple you know no yeah they I heard

722
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,159
of that but then people got air

723
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,519
conditioners and I was in the Bay Area

724
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,440
at the time where where where I was at

725
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,798
in the Bay Area nobody had air

726
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,399
conditioners in their house because it

727
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:21,798
was never more than 75 degrees it seemed

728
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:25,479
and uh and it would cool off at night

729
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,720
always even in the summer so but yeah

730
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,360
then people started getting air

731
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,278
conditioners for their indoor setups and

732
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:32,479
could really turn the temps down on them

733
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:34,119
and I think that's all you really need

734
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,240
along with a good flush just the

735
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,839
flushing alone brings the color out yeah

736
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,480
it does and then you just add cooler

737
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,359
Temps at night and I think that's when

738
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,798
you really get them to purple up strong

739
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,398
and yeah and uh yeah the the old the old

740
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:47,918
techniques for purpling there's there's

741
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,719
a couple techniques out there I've

742
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,559
probably forgotten a few there's I had a

743
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,480
Dude any of it anymore they got I mean

744
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,678
with with genetics

745
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,000
now like

746
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,559
I I can light depth stuff where it's 95

747
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,119
degrees out every day and it still

748
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,200
purples up yeah yep yeah people people

749
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,839
have figure that out genetics wise have

750
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,919
you ever heard about the car battery

751
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,439
hooked up to the uh plant to shock it

752
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,000
purple what the yeah yeah that's

753
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,440
that's one I had actually heard like the

754
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,159
guy I think he interpreted shocking the

755
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,200
plant as far as temperatures and in his

756
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,240
brain he thought it meant shocking he

757
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,399
thought it literally me shock wow we

758
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,919
talked about this in the I think me ER

759
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,398
local and farm and Dan talked about like

760
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,679
different forms of

761
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,678
violence being applied to puns and like

762
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,080
what that

763
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,639
means that's definitely one definitely

764
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,519
one another thing too I've messed around

765
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:49,278
with just like you know in that same

766
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,919
vein is um in the winter time it gets

767
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:54,798
really cold here you know so I'll I've

768
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,440
like vented like pulled uh like fresh

769
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:02,240
air in from outside into my tent you

770
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,159
know like super cold air um I don't know

771
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
I'm not really sure if it you know I'm

772
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,399
not I I don't have enough experience to

773
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,720
be like this does this you know what I

774
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:13,719
mean it feels like you're doing

775
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,880
something though so it seems like a cool

776
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,839
thing to try I don't

777
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,799
know I think that sums it up yeah that's

778
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,759
about how it feels you know what I mean

779
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,278
yeah the same reason I put copper coils

780
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,960
in my this year

781
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:28,960
outdoor you know why not

782
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,319
all right I'm gonna move us on I'm gonna

783
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,120
move us on

784
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:39,359
to how do you harvest I.E so I think

785
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,158
kush or the Giants had a couple of like

786
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,638
questions here like what time of the day

787
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,519
you know and I guess for indoor grows

788
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:48,638
it's like do you think that it's better

789
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,000
to chop in the dark and this and that so

790
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,599
yeah we can move on to that that's also

791
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,638
the like do you wet trim do you dry trim

792
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:59,158
like all that stuff all that good stuff

793
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:00,798
BL washing BL washing okay who do I get

794
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,159
to start this let's go for Kush of the

795
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:07,638
Giants to start this one yeah yeah for

796
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:11,480
sure so um for me like what what I've

797
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:14,398
noticed in my garden is like if I go out

798
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,599
to my plants and I try tying them up

799
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,159
let's say in the the evening time or in

800
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,280
the middle of the day hottest part of

801
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,000
the day or in the evening time and I'm

802
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,519
tying up some branches and I get a

803
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,599
little too too handsy with one and it

804
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,960
snaps it's real brittle and it just it

805
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,240
just cracks um I've I've noticed that

806
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,358
that that

807
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,000
plasticity is it has more plasticity

808
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,759
after she's just had her water her her

809
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,599
her drinking so in the morning there

810
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,839
there's two times that I've noticed in

811
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,800
my garden um one is like maybe an hour

812
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,878
before direct sunlight actually hits

813
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,800
them they drink they soak up they all

814
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:55,239
perk up and then the Sun comes and then

815
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,119
they they endure the heat of the day and

816
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:01,959
then on my uh trail camera through my

817
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:04,119
time-lapse videos I saw right around

818
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,760
midnight 1:00 a.m. in the morning they'd

819
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,838
all do the same thing they'd all perk

820
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,760
back up they all the fan Leafs had lift

821
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,838
up and it looked like there was a second

822
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,720
drinking phase going on during the

823
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:18,920
middle of the night and um so in my mind

824
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:21,679
I like to chop after the plants have had

825
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,039
a chance to drink so whether that be the

826
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,199
morning just before the Sun hits them or

827
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,400
late at night after they've had chance

828
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,679
to get a drink in them the branch

829
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,240
plasticity they don't break as easily

830
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,879
they're not as brittle and in my mind I

831
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,199
think that there's just more hydration

832
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,920
there's more fluid there's more water

833
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:43,879
going up the plant and so in in hang

834
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,358
what we most of us like to do is we like

835
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,480
to get a longer hang out of our plants

836
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:52,000
so the the more moisture that you have

837
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,960
in your branches and in your fan Leaf uh

838
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,280
the the longer hang you'll get out of

839
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:01,079
out of your cure and so so to me I'm

840
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,400
maximizing how much uh how I can slow

841
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:07,560
down the process of the moisture and the

842
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,880
chlorofil evaporating out of my plants

843
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,480
that are all hanging on lines in my room

844
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,880
so I uh I've been aiming to harvest

845
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,440
after I've noticed that the plants have

846
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,519
had their drink when when there's more

847
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,079
plasticity in the branches when they

848
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:23,639
don't just snap and are super brittle

849
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,880
like I noticed in In the Heat of the day

850
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,679
or uh or in the late evenings before

851
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,599
they've they've had a chance to rest and

852
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:35,039
drink um those are the times that I like

853
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:38,000
to pull my plants down um as far as wet

854
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,159
trimming and dry trimming I used to I

855
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,239
used to take a lot of fan Leaf off um

856
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:47,000
before like I I didn't have any real set

857
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,879
methods I I'd read on the forums and I'd

858
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,239
talk to my brother and ask other people

859
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,280
what they do and everybody you know it's

860
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,078
very subjective everybody has their own

861
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,599
specific way and they think that their

862
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,119
way is the best way and I just started

863
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,240
playing around with different methods

864
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,000
and what I've noticed is uh harvesting

865
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,598
bigger sections of the plant uh and

866
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,960
leaving more fan leaf on gives me a

867
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,519
longer cure uh it lets me hang on the

868
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,599
line longer it instead of like a a nine

869
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,920
or a 10 day hang on the line it'll push

870
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,880
it out to 12 or 14 days hanging on the

871
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,280
line before I want to go in there and

872
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,280
and start bucking it down and taking it

873
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,680
off the line and getting it ready to go

874
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,000
either in a a big jar or a big old

875
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,639
turkey bag depending on how big my plant

876
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,599
is so that I'm I'm

877
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:38,759
processing um and then as far as like

878
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,800
um there's a little bit of a topic we

879
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,000
want to talk about people are thinking

880
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,960
about Bud washing but for me like you

881
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,480
know people dunking their plants and

882
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,960
cleaning it off before Harvest like I do

883
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,800
a lot of uh microscoping and I I spend a

884
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,358
lot of time looking in on the plants on

885
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,880
the flowers on the leaves on the butt

886
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:01,759
and I don't see near enough dirt I don't

887
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,400
see near enough insect uh shells or

888
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,560
frass or or husks I don't see enough

889
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,440
stuff on the plant to Warrant doing any

890
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,960
washing hydrogen peroxide dipping or any

891
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,559
of that stuff that I've seen people

892
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,280
doing so as for me personally in my

893
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,039
garden I get enough late season rains

894
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,680
that it it does a good job of cleaning

895
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:28,519
the plants off from the from the ambient

896
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,519
dust that that settles on them

897
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,599
how about you little

898
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:41,280
Hill um I mean

899
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:43,639
ideally I would do things different

900
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,560
but yeah I'd like to night Harvest

901
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,838
harvest in the cool air you know I just

902
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,119
think that's it's easier on people I

903
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:54,440
know Vineyards down south of me they do

904
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,358
a lot of harvesting um at nighttime and

905
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,920
a big reason they do it yeah there's

906
00:38:56,358 --> 00:39:01,039
like they're dealing with the different

907
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,960
levels of the sugar and the acid but

908
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,358
like a huge reason they do it is just

909
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,519
heat like having the workers out there

910
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:11,598
all day in the heat is rough and yeah

911
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,519
and and for them it's also a marathon

912
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,280
it's not a Sprint so you can't you can't

913
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,719
beat the out of your crew you know

914
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,839
on a tough three-day Harvest and then

915
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:27,480
you know do it again you know and again

916
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:29,239
for like you know six weeks um so yeah

917
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,039
we start early in the

918
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:34,799
morning

919
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,480
um and we Harvest all day um just

920
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,039
depending on what's going on we might

921
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,440
take a break if it's if it's super hot

922
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,838
like we'll take a break in the middle of

923
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,358
the day for like two three hours just

924
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:51,358
during the hottest part of the day and

925
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:53,239
then Harvest till tarps at 7 um but you

926
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,719
know I

927
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:59,879
yeah I don't wash anything um um I do

928
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,759
like the plants to be I don't want the

929
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,640
plants to be parched at all um whether

930
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,680
they got watered that morning or the day

931
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,118
before as long as they're they're good

932
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,960
um I'm fine as long as they're not

933
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:16,599
droopy and Limp um I'm fine with that

934
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,159
um you know packing it in being

935
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:21,720
efficient with Space is really

936
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:23,759
important

937
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:27,358
um but

938
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,200
uh yeah I I've heard of people letting

939
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,119
the plants dry out like in in their you

940
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,799
know pots or you know like giving them

941
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,559
some I've I've heard of that um I've

942
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,560
never done it neither it just doesn't

943
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,159
seem right to me to have a stressed

944
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:47,599
plant it's not going to like whatever

945
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:48,960
potential it has of you know cannaboid

946
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,559
content

947
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,720
tpin I think it I think it would be best

948
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:57,318
to catch it in the morning when it's

949
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:59,000
nice and healthy and hydrated just

950
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:00,838
that's just what makes sense to me I

951
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,838
don't have any data to back any of this

952
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:06,480
up but my intuition tells me that yeah

953
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,719
um so I've heard I've heard you know

954
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,960
drought stressing at the end can help

955
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:14,480
bring out more you know maybe that's

956
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,039
true maybe it's not um but I mean if

957
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,639
they die on the branch isn't that like

958
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,440
oxidizing your

959
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:24,799
bud like because it's me it would that

960
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,679
process starts in the sun basically

961
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,920
that's you definitely don't want

962
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:35,598
light gold right totally

963
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,838
um uh what one thing about the bud

964
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,640
washing is like I mean that shouldn't be

965
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,759
a thing at all for indoor Growers but no

966
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,000
and honestly I don't know anybody that

967
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,920
does

968
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,358
it on any type of

969
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:54,400
outdoor um though I would question why

970
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,159
they do it but I have heard it actually

971
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,480
it increases oxidation

972
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:02,199
and your your turns brown faster

973
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,639
I've just heard that um I don't know it

974
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,399
for a fact but you know I've heard it

975
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:09,318
from people that tried it I don't know

976
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,358
like I mean peroxide is gonna oxidize

977
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:16,079
like Yeah by definition yeah totally

978
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:19,440
it's an oxidizer so y yeah I don't I

979
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,160
don't know about that

980
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,519
um you know what something all this all

981
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,679
this weed that I've been getting from

982
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,000
dispensaries all looks super hella

983
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,879
oxidized and I just realized that like

984
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,119
oh that's probably why you know

985
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,640
like it might just be

986
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,000
old that for sure is it outdoor or

987
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,480
indoor well it sold as it's sold as

988
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,719
indoor in myars but it was definitely

989
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,240
outdoor like part part of the time some

990
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:50,480
of this stuff is definitely outdoor I

991
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:52,199
know um like it's it's it's November you

992
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,199
can look at Harvest sometimes they have

993
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,480
the harvest date on the package you can

994
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,118
look at the harveste I the Harvest dates

995
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,318
were so close to when they were bought

996
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,318
that it was just like okay and I'm

997
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:05,599
looking at oxidized weed and Going H H

998
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:08,358
this is out none of this makes any sense

999
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,599
yeah what was Lo gonna say I was gonna

1000
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:13,960
say that a lot of people remediate it

1001
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,960
with like X-rays and like that um I

1002
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,639
mean at least that's what I've seen here

1003
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,679
in my state in the legal market so

1004
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:23,118
they're doing it there they radiation

1005
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:27,558
yeah so they do it to lower like tym

1006
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,000
counts and bacterial counts um

1007
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:31,079
I've been getting a lot of questions on

1008
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,719
Reddit about that and the Australian

1009
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,119
Reddit ask me anything I'm doing and

1010
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,759
like they're like hey so what's your

1011
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:39,920
opinion on irradiated weed and I was

1012
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,240
like huh what what yeah I mean it just

1013
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,920
like overall kills the character of the

1014
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,118
weed in my opinion but it like gives

1015
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,720
them clean results you know what I mean

1016
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,160
and that's what matters in the legal

1017
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:50,480
games that and you can grow a third

1018
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:53,679
testicle after you

1019
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,240
smoke yeah I mean what happens if you

1020
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,759
smoke a bacteria any type of bacteria

1021
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:02,959
nothing I mean right it's like we've

1022
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,440
bought weed like that's likely been

1023
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,039
worse than what we see like on these

1024
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,920
panel tests you know and fingernails

1025
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:14,679
come in my brick weed man yeah I'm

1026
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:17,159
totally fine um I don't know it's just

1027
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:20,719
people want to make money I guess it

1028
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:25,000
like I don't know

1029
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:27,199
look too much yes I

1030
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,199
agree I was going to invite local to

1031
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:30,318
kind of carry on just talk about some of

1032
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,239
the other questions that you all have

1033
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:40,358
answered about like when do you chop and

1034
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:42,759
you know trim that um so one um I kind

1035
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:46,440
of like to chop my stuff and the more

1036
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,720
like not the morning but like once the

1037
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,760
lights kind of go off so like that's my

1038
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:55,159
morning I guess um just cuz like you

1039
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,160
know I mean not directly after it's

1040
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,679
turned off but once like kind of all the

1041
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:01,838
heat has emitted from the room and stuff

1042
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:06,639
CU there's like residual heat from like

1043
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:09,078
the lamps and stuff um but um yeah I

1044
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,039
kind of um I don't want my plant to be

1045
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:16,359
entirely dry but I don't want it to be

1046
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:18,440
soing wet um but I I like to do little

1047
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,400
things to kind of prolong the amount of

1048
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,679
time that it's going to take to dry so

1049
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,720
like I won't like uh wet trim or

1050
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:26,919
anything like I'll leave all the leaves

1051
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,239
on um

1052
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,119
you know I mean I have an AC in the room

1053
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,199
so that really helps keep temperatures

1054
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,200
cool that wasn't the case at my last

1055
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:40,639
place um but that's like a game Cher um

1056
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:43,078
it's kind of added like five it could

1057
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,440
add up to five days te your dry if you

1058
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:49,680
want it to you know depending on how

1059
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,200
cold you get um but also like it was my

1060
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:56,199
summer so it was cool but it was also

1061
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:59,279
like not like humid but it wasn't as dry

1062
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:02,078
as it should have been per se

1063
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,640
um but yeah really anything to minimize

1064
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:09,079
the amount of uh or maximize the the

1065
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:12,159
amount of time that it takes to dry um

1066
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:15,359
and I'll usually kind of um judge that

1067
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:18,000
once like the branches not like branches

1068
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,799
but like the the buds will snap from the

1069
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,318
main branch itself because like I find

1070
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,079
that that main branch holds some

1071
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,440
moisture um and I don't want that to be

1072
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,920
entirely dry because that just like kind

1073
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,480
of signifies that the the buds that kind

1074
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,159
of dry out I would say they dry out

1075
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,358
faster than the actual

1076
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:42,679
stock um but like I I don't want my

1077
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:46,199
stock to be too dry but

1078
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:48,719
like yeah I don't know um I like them to

1079
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:51,799
have snappage a little bit of crunch to

1080
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,799
the bud

1081
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:58,000
um but yeah

1082
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,240
um what's your take on

1083
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,119
washing I've never had to wash bud

1084
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,439
before um I could see why people would

1085
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:11,119
do it outdoor like say there's like dust

1086
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,440
storms or like you know the the fires

1087
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,680
and in California like all the

1088
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:21,559
smoke and dust particles like that can

1089
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:23,118
make a need for wash but I don't know I

1090
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:24,680
liked what um when we were talking about

1091
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,160
this earlier what Chris the giant said

1092
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,799
and if you want to repeat that a little

1093
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,920
bit cuz the Giant's talking about the

1094
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,200
logic behind dipping in the same Barrel

1095
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:37,358
yeah so like in in the examples that

1096
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:40,000
I've seen um washing it's generally a

1097
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:43,119
guy washing all of his plants from the

1098
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,079
whole harvest in a single like 40 or 50

1099
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,160
gallon all of barrel drum and in my mind

1100
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,920
when I see that my first thought is okay

1101
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,199
your your argument is you're washing

1102
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,920
dust off and you're washing insects and

1103
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,719
and uh frass and husks and and wings and

1104
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,440
shells of insects that have died and

1105
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,799
left carasses on your on your thing and

1106
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,240
my first thing is I'm watching these

1107
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,760
guys and they're dunking them back to

1108
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,679
back to back and you're not giving

1109
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,559
enough time for the dust to or the dirt

1110
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,078
to settle so it's it's basically a

1111
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,800
slurry of dirt now your your water

1112
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,960
hydrogen mix or whatever medium mix that

1113
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,400
they've done um and then the second

1114
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,519
thing is the corpses though that insect

1115
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,880
frass is going to float to the top and

1116
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:27,719
so every time you dunk your branch in

1117
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,519
you're Brea dunking it on a pile of dead

1118
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,318
corpses and then mixing it in a dirt

1119
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,280
slurry just the whole the whole

1120
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:35,880
Logistics behind it never made any sense

1121
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,880
to me every time every time I've seen

1122
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,800
those videos or those pictures it looks

1123
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,160
like they're just all dunking it into

1124
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,599
one barrel as fast as they can handing

1125
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:46,399
it to the person and then putting it on

1126
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,200
the line and that's that's just crazy to

1127
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,960
me another thing I noticed in these like

1128
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:54,439
the red amas were that a lot of people

1129
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,280
don't understand that like before

1130
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,039
they're big

1131
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,680
like you know let's say someone has a

1132
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:02,838
question about you know growing 20 acres

1133
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:06,039
outdoor and they're you know they have

1134
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:08,279
questions about you know like should

1135
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:11,119
should I you know dry this or cure this

1136
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,280
in glass or blah blah blah and it's like

1137
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,920
you didn't think about where you're

1138
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,160
going to dry that before you grew

1139
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,079
it like that should be a major major

1140
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,798
major thought where the am I gonna

1141
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,119
dry all this you know but most

1142
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:23,079
people it seems like a lot of these

1143
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,880
Chads that started the hemp you know

1144
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:26,960
and got into it they didn't even

1145
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,119
take that into count like where

1146
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,960
where are we going to dry it do we got

1147
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:31,480
like a garage that could be enough you

1148
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,920
know like right I don't know that's

1149
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,519
something I've noticed too people don't

1150
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,838
take that

1151
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:41,400
uh that's that's been many pot growers

1152
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:43,119
failure of harvest is not accounting for

1153
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,000
where they're going to dry it or like

1154
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,599
drying it in carports or Y yeah hemp

1155
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,199
Farmers some of them thought they could

1156
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,798
just cut it and let it dry

1157
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,199
outside you know some of them some of

1158
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:57,719
them thought that they could roll it

1159
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:00,318
there was some company going out there

1160
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:04,199
convincing people you could just roll it

1161
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:08,480
wet into like this giant roll like a

1162
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:12,118
bail of like a bail of hay or something

1163
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,920
nice yeah I believe I remember that

1164
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,318
company's not around anymore because it

1165
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,639
didn't

1166
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:21,400
work yeah but like I've seen people fail

1167
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:23,719
i' I've seen people fail with yielding

1168
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,318
more than they thought they would yeah

1169
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,078
um and and and not accounting for dry

1170
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,639
space and just having shitty dry space

1171
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,280
like having to put up car ports to dry

1172
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:36,239
in yeah and then just not having the

1173
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,359
like gumption to realize that maybe you

1174
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:42,078
should try and insulate it or you

1175
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:44,480
know you're not even using that space

1176
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:49,519
efficiently to hang as much as you can

1177
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,920
in there and and uh it it's it's

1178
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,318
definitely a failure not knowing where

1179
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,838
you're going to dry and that and that

1180
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,639
can happen indoors too you sure you you

1181
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:59,318
know you you trick out your little your

1182
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,519
grow tent or your room and then you

1183
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:05,279
realize that like oh I got to spend 10

1184
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:07,119
more days hanging it in here because

1185
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,160
it's GNA stink at my house if I move it

1186
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,599
anywhere else and or

1187
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:16,358
uh yeah you need like a separate dry

1188
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:19,039
tent you need you know just like you

1189
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:21,639
need a separate veg area yes if if you

1190
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,079
want to if you really want to to to to

1191
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:26,798
to repack that room as fast as

1192
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,280
possible um how much space would you

1193
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:30,358
give like let's say you're growing let's

1194
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,079
say it's a 10 lighter right how much

1195
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:34,159
space would you want to incorporate for

1196
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,960
this 10 lighter for your drying space

1197
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,399
what would you guys

1198
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,159
recommend I would say about a third of

1199
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,160
that space so like if you're in a I mean

1200
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,798
what's what's a 10 lighter like a 10 x

1201
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:51,078
20 room or something like that something

1202
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:53,280
like that um that's that's what 200 feet

1203
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,400
200 square feet so a third of that would

1204
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,798
be like 66 square feet yeah cuz if like

1205
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,200
you figure you have one

1206
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:04,960
canopy uh over 10 lights but if you

1207
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:07,159
stack it three High then you should be

1208
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,920
able to get away with thir space right

1209
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:11,920
absolutely yeah yeah it's a good rule of

1210
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,000
THB too there there's probably some

1211
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,838
better calulations on that um I I I

1212
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,039
really just kind of like got a ballpark

1213
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:23,078
it like I don't even have any real

1214
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,558
calculations on on on space like I know

1215
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,960
when I have enough and I know when I

1216
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,680
don't yeah and I kind of Base it off of

1217
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,480
Old rooms old dry barns like okay I had

1218
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:35,879
this many lines or this much like like

1219
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,960
linear feet of line to hang on I need

1220
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,599
that same to hang you know one green

1221
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,280
house or two green houses and that's

1222
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:47,240
kind of how I've gone in the past

1223
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,280
general like ballpark guessing and and I

1224
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,159
definitely didn't have enough

1225
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,960
space hang dry room set up I just wanted

1226
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,358
to let Erin answer the questions first

1227
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,760
because then the next section is going

1228
00:52:56,358 --> 00:53:02,759
to be all on like the actual dry and

1229
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:05,920
like quote unquote cure process um yeah

1230
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,040
so er did you want to speak to the

1231
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,639
earlier questions about chop times I

1232
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,960
don't I don't think I have very much to

1233
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,639
add I think you guys hit all the points

1234
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,199
that I would hit as well as far as

1235
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,400
cutting the plants I mean you know I

1236
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,118
just want them to look Rick I'm ready

1237
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,358
and I you know I like to just be

1238
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,798
prepared have everything there and I

1239
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,880
want to be able to be

1240
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:31,119
like cutting them and hanging them and

1241
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,480
all that stuff done as fast as possible

1242
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,599
I don't want to be messing around with

1243
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,000
the plants that's the only thing I would

1244
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:42,359
add otherwise that's pretty much

1245
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,838
it okay nice okay sorry little Hill yeah

1246
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:46,719
we can now talk about like the actual

1247
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:49,519
you know drying and you know quote

1248
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:52,838
unquote curing uh dry room setups all

1249
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:57,119
that yeah this is f so I I'll just say

1250
00:53:52,838 --> 00:54:00,078
that um I do my drying in the fridge uh

1251
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,640
some of you know that I you

1252
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,200
know am under like quite serious spatial

1253
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,838
constraints so I can only flower a few

1254
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,118
things at a time I can keep a few things

1255
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:09,838
like a few more things than that but I

1256
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,400
can really only flower a few things at a

1257
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:17,279
time um and so I actually dry my stuff

1258
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:20,039
in the fridge uh which some of you know

1259
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,000
about um and on the Discord like there's

1260
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:25,358
a whole Channel about drying in the

1261
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,838
fridge and what that is um but just

1262
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,519
wanted to mention that as like a point

1263
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:29,519
of difference

1264
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:36,318
here I was also gonna just answer that

1265
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:38,879
question Matt asked about like Dry size

1266
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,679
to like the size of your room on a much

1267
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,720
smaller scale uh because I don't have a

1268
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:47,199
tin lighter I just have a one lighter

1269
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:49,679
and a five by five and uh I I go into a

1270
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:52,159
two by4 with that which I think pretty

1271
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,679
much falls into the a third of your

1272
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,039
space um as well so I think that's like

1273
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:00,558
a really Great rule of thumb just to hit

1274
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:02,079
that nail on the head again y yeah the

1275
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,920
third of your space is a great rule of

1276
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,280
thumb but also like continually me and

1277
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,720
me and little Hill were talking about

1278
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:11,559
this just last night is like when you

1279
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,679
when you're sizing up like if you have

1280
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:17,798
the option to build your your dry room

1281
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:20,039
always add like another 20 or 25% on top

1282
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:22,559
of what you think you need like every

1283
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,679
single time I've set up a grow room and

1284
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,880
or I picked a spot in the basement and I

1285
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:28,919
set up lines I'm looking at it I'm like

1286
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,920
yeah this is good and then Harvest comes

1287
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,680
and like I could always use like

1288
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,119
two or three more lines there's there's

1289
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:37,679
never been a time where it's like I

1290
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,838
couldn't have used the extra space so if

1291
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,239
if you have the ability to I would say

1292
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,159
build it bigger than your initial

1293
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:48,318
thoughts are and and it you'll see the

1294
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:50,279
benefits of it I'm almost guarantee it

1295
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,038
do any of us here have a different

1296
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,559
opinion than drying slower and

1297
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,000
deliberate is better like I know the uh

1298
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,960
one of the episodes I interviewed

1299
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,679
someone and they said they like to use a

1300
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,679
dehydrator and um does anybody else uh

1301
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,038
have a different method than slow and

1302
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:08,038
deliver

1303
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,639
it I mean I've heard of people using

1304
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:18,000
freeze dryers for flow but I've not had

1305
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:21,159
I've no never had it never had any

1306
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,798
experience with it um but I think that

1307
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:26,639
that is something that's out there as

1308
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:29,519
far as a super fast option but you know

1309
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:32,960
yes low and slow is the name of the game

1310
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,318
I think yeah I'll add that that's kind

1311
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,960
of the whole point of the fridge thing

1312
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,838
as well I know that for some people it's

1313
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,838
like weird Fringe idea and I don't I

1314
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:43,838
personally can't say anecdotally that I

1315
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:45,038
know it's any bitter than hanging um but

1316
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:47,759
it's kind of what I'm constrained to

1317
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,720
doing at the moment um but the principle

1318
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,200
is the same the longer you can draw out

1319
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:55,598
that process the better yeah you're ex

1320
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,480
it's an exchange process and the slower

1321
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,400
The Exchange process of moisture and

1322
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,480
chlorophyll is the better the end

1323
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,960
product is and that's that's not I'm not

1324
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,480
saying this is scientific this is just

1325
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,599
what I've noticed from my flowers from

1326
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:12,280
my garden that I hang and I trim if they

1327
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:14,960
have a if if they have a longer chance

1328
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,160
to hang on the line before branches are

1329
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,440
brittle enough to snap clean with no

1330
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,480
fibers I'm the people will say oh yeah

1331
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,960
it snaps clean and I'll snap it but

1332
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,480
there's still a fiber hanging on I'm

1333
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,679
like that's not clean no it needs to be

1334
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,559
an ual clean snap like if you held up a

1335
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:32,399
light and you moved the and you moved a

1336
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,880
branch too much you're going to see some

1337
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,920
THC flutter off into the air like it

1338
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,599
should be at a point where it's that

1339
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,079
that far gone in my opinion before but

1340
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,559
at least that's what I like when I'm

1341
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:45,318
trimming my stuff down yep um and me and

1342
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,319
little were just talking about this last

1343
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:49,960
night as well there there's something

1344
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:51,960
that people don't uh don't consider is

1345
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,039
you'll go into your hang room and a lot

1346
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,880
of people use these totes I see them

1347
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:59,520
everywhere this 55 gallon totes with the

1348
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,559
yellow Lids they'll take their stuff off

1349
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,000
the line stuff them into the totes put a

1350
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,319
lid on it and say yeah I'm going to trim

1351
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,798
this in an hour or two and then they

1352
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,440
don't get around till to tomorrow and

1353
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,480
that time it spent in the tote

1354
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,519
rehydrated it and now you're working

1355
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,280
with a little bit wetter weed than what

1356
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:17,239
you would normally like to to trim with

1357
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,519
like people you know so you can think

1358
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:21,239
that it's fully out of moisture throw it

1359
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,880
all in a tote and then it it starts to

1360
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:24,798
rehydrate on itself a little bit because

1361
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,680
it's now working with a smaller

1362
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:30,519
atmosphere it's now it's now has more

1363
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,598
moisture in a smaller area um yeah so

1364
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:36,480
for me I've always aimed for lower and

1365
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:38,720
slower um and it's just benefited me and

1366
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,240
the last six or seven years I've had the

1367
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,078
awesome benefit of when I chop like the

1368
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,239
when I'm chopping it's also

1369
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,798
simultaneously raining outside so my

1370
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:52,358
barn gets a little moisture boost boost

1371
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:55,119
and the the ambient moisture fills the

1372
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:58,199
barn and then F also affects the the

1373
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,680
grow room that I had built inside inside

1374
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:03,358
of the barn so or the Hang room that I

1375
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:03,358
built inside of the

1376
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:09,519
barn yeah I mean and that's for me

1377
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,838
that's been a benefit with the using my

1378
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:15,159
like using like a 2x4 tent in my

1379
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:17,480
scenario I I it's like a Perpetual thing

1380
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:19,118
and I have the environment pretty much

1381
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,960
controlled at a certain place that I

1382
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:26,240
wanted at so I kind of just let myself

1383
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:28,440
hang for um you know like it it may take

1384
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:31,558
say two weeks to dry out but I'll let it

1385
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:35,200
hang another week or two uh just hanging

1386
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:38,079
in there and then um and then I you know

1387
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:40,318
when I'm ready to that like like for me

1388
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,720
what that allows me to do is like just

1389
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,519
slowly work through each plant and as

1390
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,919
far as like trimming or however you want

1391
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:50,358
to you know do that and then I go into

1392
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,798
like I like the mason jars that have um

1393
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:55,400
they're like amber colored you know uh

1394
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,920
to like cut out light degradation

1395
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,599
um obviously if you're doing a ton of

1396
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,480
stuff that's probably not they're like $

1397
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,798
Five Doll a jar now so it's probably not

1398
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,280
great but for my skill it's you know I

1399
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,280
really like

1400
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,599
them so no dehydrator tech for you er no

1401
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,118
dehydrator I mean I'm shooting for as

1402
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,440
long as possible but I'm not doing any

1403
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:20,200
weird like burping or anything like that

1404
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,240
generally speaking I I'm just trying to

1405
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:25,038
leave it alone as much as

1406
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:28,159
possible yeah so we all agreed generally

1407
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:30,920
that longer and slower is better um so

1408
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:34,118
with that what's the average in your

1409
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,880
room setup like if and and there's also

1410
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:38,519
there's also a little Aster to this

1411
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:42,400
question as well because I my personal

1412
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:44,960
uh hang room is like a 25 by3 room and

1413
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,318
if I were to hang let's say only three

1414
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,119
plants on one end of the room and don't

1415
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:52,599
H and I don't fill the rest of the room

1416
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:54,240
it's a totally different exchange of

1417
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:56,079
than than if I were to stuff the room

1418
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:58,719
complet

1419
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,640
so um yeah there there's there's a

1420
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,358
little bit of a Nuance to discuss there

1421
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:05,639
about um the in your your hang room will

1422
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:06,838
act different depending on how many

1423
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:08,719
plants you have stuffed in there and

1424
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:10,599
that's something that you should plan in

1425
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,318
your Harvest depending on if you're

1426
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:14,280
harvesting everything at once or if

1427
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:15,960
you're staggered harvesting this is

1428
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,480
something that you should and not only

1429
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,720
that but let's say like in my room I

1430
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:25,679
have uh 14 or 15 lines and I put them in

1431
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:28,038
at the back and I harvest Pally and and

1432
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,519
hang them in sometimes the plants that

1433
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:34,640
are done in the back when I bring in a

1434
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:37,280
fresh set of plants for uh on row number

1435
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:39,558
eight or nine those back plants will get

1436
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,200
a little moisture refresh and so the

1437
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:43,039
question I want to pose is generally

1438
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,759
what if if there's no outside

1439
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,400
environmental factors about how many

1440
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,200
days does it take in your room before

1441
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,440
branches are snapping off clean and

1442
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:55,558
you're ready to Buck down for me it's

1443
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:57,519
about 12 to 13 and if I have rain

1444
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:59,480
outside from the environment it's it's

1445
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:02,079
usually a couple days extra on top of

1446
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,400
that sometimes I'll get 14 14 days out

1447
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,119
of the Hang before I'm going in there

1448
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,680
and saying hey I should I should start

1449
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,358
bucking this stuff down for me it's a 14

1450
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:15,558
to eight like anal

1451
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:18,798
21 somewhere in there for

1452
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:19,839
indoor I think I'm more like I'm like 10

1453
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:26,000
to

1454
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:29,480
14 um the the I I've de I'll definitely

1455
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,239
rehydrate the room at some point if I if

1456
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,559
I like fill one half up wait seven days

1457
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:37,399
then fill the other half up it's going

1458
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,359
to be longer than 10 for that first half

1459
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,720
yeah that happens all the time to me and

1460
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,239
I don't mind it it just slows it down so

1461
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:45,879
I'm fine with it I mean I'd like to get

1462
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:48,759
things moving but you know you can't

1463
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:52,680
really Rush that part yeah

1464
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:55,319
um so yeah 10 to 14 I'd say I don't want

1465
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:57,519
them to get too dry on the line it

1466
01:02:55,318 --> 01:03:00,440
depends a lot on whether like what kind

1467
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:03,159
of plant you cut like do you have a lot

1468
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,358
of thick colas or are they like longer

1469
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:07,078
extended branches with just golf balls

1470
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:10,598
up them good point because obviously

1471
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:13,760
those dry a little faster um and and I

1472
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:17,480
pack I pack my weed in so much that like

1473
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:21,278
I might have you know six to 10 lines

1474
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:24,119
vertically going in each section six six

1475
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:24,960
to nine lines deep so it's like a wall

1476
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:27,838
of

1477
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,838
weed with another wall of weed nine

1478
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,759
inches behind it and another wall of

1479
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:35,440
weed because I'm only cutting like maybe

1480
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,400
12 inch to to 18 inch branches at the

1481
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,480
most yeah that's what like like that's

1482
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,798
the size Branch everything is whether

1483
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:47,119
it's a lower Branch or or a center Cola

1484
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:50,559
so you know packing it in like you know

1485
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:53,480
my my humidity skyrockets up to possibly

1486
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:57,000
up to 80h and then you know it just

1487
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:58,559
ticks down every day after that um

1488
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,838
usually at the beginning I'll run an

1489
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,640
extra dehumidifier or something just to

1490
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:05,239
cut it a little bit faster to get it

1491
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:07,358
into the 60s yeah and then after that I

1492
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:11,838
slow it down because I don't want it to

1493
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:15,480
get you know into the low 50s or 40s um

1494
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:18,838
at least not for too long um right at

1495
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,000
the end that's fine but uh you know if

1496
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:24,199
you leave it in that kind of like low

1497
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,039
humidity for too long it gets brittle

1498
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:27,159
hly I think you're just yeah I think I

1499
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:29,680
think I don't think you're you're

1500
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:32,440
helping yourself you're you're probably

1501
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:35,558
uh you're probably evaporating turpins

1502
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,400
at that point and uh the temp

1503
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:40,319
temperature- wise I'm I'm always in the

1504
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,798
60s um usually mid to high

1505
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:47,318
60s um I know a lot of people say that's

1506
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:50,639
not ideal but like I've I've

1507
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:54,558
Cur I've I've dried in all types of room

1508
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:56,440
uninsulated um in wintertime you know

1509
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,079
uninsulated in

1510
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,400
summertime uh I've done it all different

1511
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:04,480
types of ways and there's all different

1512
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,079
types types of uh tricks to slow it down

1513
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,920
but that but like you know I used to use

1514
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:12,359
an evaporative cooler to cool my dry

1515
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:15,079
barn and it worked like it would drop

1516
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:16,838
the temperature in there 10 degrees and

1517
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:20,318
it would add a little bit of humidity

1518
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:24,278
too yeah in summertime when humidity is

1519
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:26,679
you know 20 25% in the day like that

1520
01:05:24,278 --> 01:05:28,880
that extra humidity was almost nothing

1521
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:30,719
but it was still something yeah and it

1522
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:34,240
still was able to slow it down and cool

1523
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:37,078
it down and uh you know I still I still

1524
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,959
dried good weed in that Barn in

1525
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,440
summertime and then it's the exact

1526
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,240
opposite problem in winter time or or in

1527
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,720
fall you're you're trying to heat it but

1528
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:49,038
you're also trying to you got to have it

1529
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:51,078
warm enough in there to run the

1530
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,079
dehumidifiers because your dehumidifiers

1531
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:56,278
might only work down to 50 degrees or

1532
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:59,599
something and uh you you know it's much

1533
01:05:56,278 --> 01:06:02,960
cold colder than that at night so I

1534
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:05,359
don't know just always uh I have a

1535
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,440
climate controlled barn now so that's

1536
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:10,038
like that's nice really nice it's nice

1537
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,679
it was ALS it's also like it was also a

1538
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:14,359
new thing to learn because I was I was

1539
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,440
so used to hustling it and and back in

1540
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:19,358
the day like that trying to keep your

1541
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,599
barn warm enough like that definitely

1542
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,318
you were slow drying and it was nice

1543
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,519
because you it really worked out well

1544
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:26,960
even though you're

1545
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:30,679
you're you're hustling it the whole time

1546
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:33,159
so um working with uh air conditioners

1547
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:34,679
and and large dehumidifiers was also

1548
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:37,239
something to learn because you can overd

1549
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:40,558
drry your pretty quick oh yeah um

1550
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:42,598
if if you don't stay on top of it and uh

1551
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,119
so that's one thing I like to do is as

1552
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:47,359
soon as I think it's ready there's

1553
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,880
moisture meters you can buy I don't use

1554
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,639
one anymore before the fire I did I lost

1555
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,240
it in the fire and I just never replaced

1556
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:58,480
it um they they're used to uh measure

1557
01:06:55,239 --> 01:07:00,399
the moisture of lumber or firewood yep

1558
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,960
and if you really want to get anal about

1559
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,960
it you can put the two little prongs on

1560
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,920
that moisture meter on the stem on the

1561
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,880
actual bud stem though just to see where

1562
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,240
you're at so you can have a number and I

1563
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,920
know people have used these things for

1564
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:18,558
uh for helping their workers get the

1565
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,119
feel for it oh interesting so they can

1566
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,119
look at a number instead of just getting

1567
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,200
a feel for it or get the feel for it and

1568
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:29,599
then look at the number to corroborate

1569
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:33,038
like okay that's what 10% or 12% feels

1570
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,720
like um those were kind of helpful for

1571
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:38,760
training people at one point I don't

1572
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:40,798
really do it anymore I feel like the

1573
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,680
people I have doing it have have have

1574
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,719
the feel for it and I've showed them and

1575
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:47,639
and they understand they understand the

1576
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,439
whole thing about like what kush was

1577
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:54,358
saying talking about where you might

1578
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:56,679
have crispy Buds and your stems might

1579
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:59,000
snap a little bit or maybe they don't at

1580
01:07:56,679 --> 01:08:02,118
all but just because your buds are

1581
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,480
crispy doesn't mean your plants dry in

1582
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:06,599
fact you want to slow that process down

1583
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,079
because all your water is moving from

1584
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:13,359
the main stem to the to the secondary

1585
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,920
stem to the bud stem to the flow and

1586
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,238
then out into the atmosphere as soon as

1587
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,719
you seal it

1588
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:21,039
up everything's going to redistribute

1589
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,359
it's all the moisture is going to

1590
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:24,679
redistribute evenly in that sealed

1591
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,520
environment

1592
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:28,880
and so you can all that so all that

1593
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,719
little extra water is going to move

1594
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,199
through the flower into the

1595
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:34,520
atmosphere and so that flour is going to

1596
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:37,559
get mushy

1597
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:40,679
again and if you're trying to store weed

1598
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:44,239
for any period of time if you store it

1599
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:46,199
wet it's gonna oxidize way faster y it's

1600
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:49,759
gonna it's gonna smell like hay it's

1601
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:51,919
gonna turn brown fast and you just did

1602
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:55,000
all that work for nothing

1603
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,158
so figuring out when to seal it and it

1604
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,359
can be used as a trick to get just like

1605
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:02,519
a little bit of that extra water out of

1606
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:05,120
the stem is just to seal it overnight

1607
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,960
and then boom open it the next day draw

1608
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,798
it out you know flowers might go from

1609
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,600
mushy to crispy that's fine you only

1610
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,600
sealed it for like you know 12 hours and

1611
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,480
then seal it up again and then check it

1612
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,279
12 hours later to make sure you're still

1613
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:19,879
crunchy and then you know you're good

1614
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:23,199
and you can do it again if you're really

1615
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:25,039
trying to dry it out and store it for a

1616
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:27,519
long Peri periods like if you know it's

1617
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:30,359
going to be stored for multiple months

1618
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,480
yeah um which is something a lot of

1619
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:34,798
outdoor Growers do is they don't sell

1620
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,479
their they don't sell their Harvest till

1621
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:39,079
you know six months later after they

1622
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:42,559
harvest it yeah and that's a good way to

1623
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:44,479
keep the color keep the smell um but

1624
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,759
it's it's definitely at scale it's

1625
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:48,959
definitely a trick it's a lot of extra

1626
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:51,600
work if you it up because then you

1627
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,079
have to go burping you know 50 bins and

1628
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,079
who's got space even to B to put 50

1629
01:09:54,079 --> 01:10:00,479
bends out you know space is a premium

1630
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:03,158
and and uh so like hitting it and

1631
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,439
checking it to make sure you did hit it

1632
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:07,879
the next day is is really really

1633
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:10,238
important and once they get sealed up in

1634
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,840
those bins you got to make sure your

1635
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,839
outside the bin environment is not extra

1636
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,960
moist or extra cold um you of course you

1637
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,760
want it cool but you don't you got to

1638
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,158
watch the humidity yeah um I think out

1639
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,440
outside humidity only really matters if

1640
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:29,198
it's too High cuz they will it's not

1641
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:31,079
really sealed like it's got time

1642
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:32,960
everything's going to equalize between

1643
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:35,519
your room your and what's inside your

1644
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,920
bin because it's not really really

1645
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,800
sealed um so you want to keep all those

1646
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:44,119
things in check so it doesn't re go

1647
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,480
regaining moisture which which which it

1648
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:49,559
absolutely will do if you let it get you

1649
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:53,198
know more humid in your room or

1650
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:55,280
cold um also if you're sealing in

1651
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,479
plastic jars are great that's why jars

1652
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:59,079
are great because they're impermeable

1653
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:01,599
you're not going to regain any moisture

1654
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:03,319
but if you're in Turkey bags like you

1655
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,640
need three turkey bags to actually have

1656
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:08,039
it sealed for moisture and smell for

1657
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,800
that matter and if you're vacuum sealing

1658
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:12,800
you need at least two layers yeah I was

1659
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,039
going to say I I've seen dudes like

1660
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,320
Harvest and what they'll do is like you

1661
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:20,000
know stuff it all in those really thin

1662
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,399
plastic like Ziploc bags like the

1663
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,640
sandwich baggies that aren't for a

1664
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:25,359
freezer but like real thin and they'll

1665
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,880
sell it like that and you know you get

1666
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:28,679
it you put it in your jars and then all

1667
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,880
of a sudden a day later everything's

1668
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:33,079
like moist and because there's still

1669
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,199
some air Exchange in those thin baggies

1670
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:36,760
so keep that in mind too like if people

1671
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,119
are putting in thin baggies like

1672
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,800
it's not it's not a good measure for if

1673
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,359
it's dry or not there's a lot of

1674
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,320
moisture that can be kept in there and

1675
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:47,599
appear

1676
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:51,479
dry there are two things that I wanted

1677
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:55,400
to talk about um one of them is um the

1678
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:58,198
different types of Bud and the

1679
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:00,879
preference in how wet or how dry I want

1680
01:11:58,198 --> 01:12:02,879
them when I'm trimming them for example

1681
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:07,159
before before we go on this coach can we

1682
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,159
hear from like local and Ern about yeah

1683
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,719
absolutely for Lo um I was just gonna

1684
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:17,638
say I I really don't have much to add

1685
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:21,039
here um if if Kush was

1686
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:24,000
gonna um go on ahead and speak but I'm

1687
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:26,039
also not speaking for earn

1688
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,039
yeah yeah I mean it's kind of the same I

1689
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:30,519
wanted to Echo just what kush said about

1690
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:33,920
like um how many plants you have in your

1691
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:37,159
dry face because I'm sorry my dogs are

1692
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,158
talking if you guys hear

1693
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:46,719
that but um the what I used to try to

1694
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:49,960
like Harvest out of my 5x5 and dry in my

1695
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:51,279
5x5 and um like as your plants lose a

1696
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,639
little bit of water weight you know

1697
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,119
after like the first day or so it's like

1698
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:57,079
they don't take up that much room in

1699
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:59,880
there and I found that even if I would

1700
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:04,439
like dial my environment in like on my

1701
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:06,760
you know via controllers and stuff um it

1702
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,678
would still they would dry out too fast

1703
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,600
and I just like never could get a handle

1704
01:13:08,679 --> 01:13:13,359
on it and then when I went to a smaller

1705
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:17,079
dry space it like really stepped my game

1706
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,920
up with um drying my plants and stuff so

1707
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:20,319
that was like such a big thing that I

1708
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,880
learned early on and I just kind of

1709
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:24,399
wanted to Echo it because it really did

1710
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,960
help me a lot

1711
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:30,599
yeah I also wanted to like just give a

1712
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,079
little very short outline on what it's

1713
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,320
like for me to dry in the fridge just

1714
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,920
because I think some people might be

1715
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:38,198
interested maybe you guys think it's

1716
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:41,719
ridiculous I'm not sure I'm interested

1717
01:13:38,198 --> 01:13:45,359
yeah I want to hear about it I I mean

1718
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:47,119
the principle is the same uh so the what

1719
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,359
changes is that obviously you're not

1720
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,880
going to put your whole plant in the

1721
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:54,039
fridge and like as a single thing um

1722
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,840
partly because it actually takes really

1723
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:58,039
really long even if you had the space to

1724
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,600
hang a plant in the fridge I don't know

1725
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:04,519
what kind of like how long that would

1726
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:07,440
actually take to try it out um I have to

1727
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:10,000
remove uh I I do break my plant down

1728
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,479
before it goes in um and even then after

1729
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,560
breaking it down I'm leaving a bit of

1730
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:16,479
stem on uh every bit uh it still takes

1731
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,800
like two to three weeks so it's still

1732
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:22,759
already quite a decent uh you know time

1733
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,840
frame for drying um in terms of judging

1734
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,920
when it's done

1735
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:30,679
the kind of loose the loose guide uh

1736
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,679
that shaie actually recommended was

1737
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:36,440
doing a weight calculation and looking

1738
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:38,960
for about 25% of the original wet weight

1739
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:41,399
um you can of course follow it up with

1740
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,439
the the stem uh you know the stem kind

1741
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:46,039
of snapping test or like what degree of

1742
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:49,000
snappiness it's at and those are

1743
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:52,238
generally what I use to determine like

1744
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,639
uh when it should move on um it's

1745
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,799
interesting uh measuring by weight so

1746
01:14:54,639 --> 01:14:59,000
basically every little how it works is

1747
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,400
that you break the plant up you put them

1748
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,158
into like paper bags and you put those

1749
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:04,238
paper bags in the fridge essentially

1750
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:06,158
that's that's that's all it is but

1751
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,439
what's quite convenient is that I will

1752
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,920
Mark the original weight and the target

1753
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:11,759
weight before everything goes in the

1754
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,920
fridge and at that point I just take

1755
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,239
them out and put them on the scale and I

1756
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,560
can tell when the bags are ready

1757
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:22,479
individually I also try to keep it so

1758
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,840
that the I try to group the flowers by

1759
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:28,119
Mass

1760
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:29,480
as well so that uh you don't get I think

1761
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,760
it's kind of getting towards kush's

1762
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:33,079
question as well like you don't get

1763
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,520
different sized or quality buds in one

1764
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:36,479
bag because you don't really know

1765
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,320
whether they're all drying out at the

1766
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:41,599
same rate whereas they're roughly the

1767
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:44,439
same mass you can you know sort of like

1768
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:48,280
uh you know ballpark estimate that okay

1769
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:50,079
it's it's probably mostly done um I

1770
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:51,679
don't know like uh was there anything

1771
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,920
you all wanted to know about the fridge

1772
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:58,079
stuff uh uh yeah your your um your

1773
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,000
bagging method are you double bagging or

1774
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,920
is it just brown paper bags into the

1775
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,760
fridge or the brown paper bags going

1776
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:09,359
into another bag like a turkey bag as a

1777
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:12,560
secondary good question so I think what

1778
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:15,000
most people are doing is just a single

1779
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,360
uh brown paper bag but I have seen

1780
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
variations and myself I actually put

1781
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:23,679
them all into a cardboard box because I

1782
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,319
have to use our like actual fridge and

1783
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,158
the cardboard box just kind of ensures

1784
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:29,559
that it has a little like microclimate

1785
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:30,879
that doesn't get like destabilized as

1786
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:33,639
soon as someone opens the door of the

1787
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,639
fridge so it's a little bit of a buffer

1788
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:37,679
um that's the only difference uh I have

1789
01:16:35,639 --> 01:16:40,319
seen people use like pizza boxes I've

1790
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,920
seen people use like more than one bag I

1791
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,279
think it really does it's just one of

1792
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,840
those things where I think you kind of

1793
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:47,399
have to tailor it to your particular

1794
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,560
fridge and like your your environmental

1795
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:52,079
humidity and everything because that all

1796
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,039
of that is going to have an impact as

1797
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,198
well

1798
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:58,639
how does how my only question would be

1799
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:01,119
how does the the actual temperature

1800
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:01,119
impact

1801
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:06,519
curing because like I mean just thinking

1802
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:09,159
about the the basics with what Peach was

1803
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:11,440
talking about with the um with you know

1804
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:14,039
like freezer keeping it in the freezer

1805
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:15,879
will keep the turps and everything way

1806
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:17,800
longer than in the fridge there's a slow

1807
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,520
degradation in the fridge but it's very

1808
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,279
very slow so I'm wondering if there is

1809
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,840
what kind of gash exchange goes on that

1810
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,920
temperature for

1811
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,520
curing I wish I knew more about the

1812
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,279
science and I should also qualify that

1813
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,480
this is strictly for the drying part um

1814
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,920
I don't know if I would consider this

1815
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:38,279
like part of quote unquote curing um

1816
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,359
this is just to get the moisture out but

1817
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:43,439
the idea is that at a certain threshold

1818
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:45,719
of temperature you are losing Less in

1819
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,599
terms of like the volatiles and stuff I

1820
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:49,639
again I don't that makes sense none of

1821
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,480
this has been proven to me um and like I

1822
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:53,000
said earlier I've never actually done a

1823
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:56,879
side by side I would love for someone to

1824
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,238
to do it at some point um but it's just

1825
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,199
yeah given the constraints it's kind of

1826
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:02,559
one of the only ways I can keep things

1827
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:05,599
going pretty quickly um

1828
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:08,159
yeah yeah what's the uh what's the

1829
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:11,039
relative humidity in the

1830
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:12,599
fridge I did check this I don't know if

1831
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:16,039
I could tell you off the top of my head

1832
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:18,280
right now think it's 4 or something like

1833
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:21,479
that yeah it'll be like 20 to 30

1834
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:24,840
probably in the fridge oh wow okay so

1835
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:28,000
it's low definitely good to have it in a

1836
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,560
bag in that case yeah that probably it's

1837
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,279
probably different in that bag it's

1838
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,280
probably a little higher in that bag

1839
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:35,880
right probably higher and also I guess

1840
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:37,679
the interplay with the temperature is

1841
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,800
definitely something I don't understand

1842
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,920
like you know obviously the low temp

1843
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:45,119
keeps it going for much longer but the

1844
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,600
low humidity also is like you know a

1845
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:50,000
counter point to that so it's I mean

1846
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,159
it's the the humidity is relative to the

1847
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,719
temperature to the water holding

1848
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:57,479
capacity of of the air so it's

1849
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:59,520
definitely even though it's low it's

1850
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:01,279
still it's really cold so it's really

1851
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,840
slowing it down because the air can't

1852
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:06,158
hold that much water anyways yeah that's

1853
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,119
right so yeah so it's not the same as

1854
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,559
having it hot and dry where it would dry

1855
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:12,719
out in a

1856
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:16,039
Flash yeah much different

1857
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:17,719
yeah yeah so I mean if anyone out there

1858
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:19,920
kind of has more science or more

1859
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:21,600
knowledge about how that works or you

1860
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,480
know any theories about whether it's

1861
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,600
good or bad I would love to know

1862
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:28,519
um leave a comment below please well I

1863
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,480
was just I'll have to look up the study

1864
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,320
but I was just looking up a study about

1865
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,519
chlorophyll leeching in cold

1866
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:37,158
temperatures and that the chlorophyll

1867
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,679
and it it was studied off of water so

1868
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:41,599
storms uh in the summer the water would

1869
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,719
have a higher chlorophyll count whereas

1870
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,760
that same water in the winter storm when

1871
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:47,560
it was cold would have a much lower

1872
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,760
chlorophyll count and so there were

1873
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,880
there was talking about leeching and how

1874
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:56,800
chlorophyll has a harder time um

1875
01:19:52,880 --> 01:20:00,000
plasticizing or or uh having

1876
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,960
biosynthesis um being created um under

1877
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,158
colder temperatures so there could be

1878
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,279
benefits to the cold temperatures not

1879
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:10,198
allowing the chlorophyll to operate um

1880
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,599
in a negative way or and staying inside

1881
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:13,879
of the the plant

1882
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,800
material yeah I think that's definitely

1883
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:18,719
one of the that low temperature

1884
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:20,239
affecting you know various um metabolic

1885
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,560
processes and all that is definitely one

1886
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:24,879
of the contentious points like whether

1887
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,080
you know what's good and what's bad

1888
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,480
about that

1889
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:31,679
um compared to a conventional or more

1890
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:33,559
conventional dry you know all that stuff

1891
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,079
is like a bit of a

1892
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:39,880
mystery yeah I'd love to do side by side

1893
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,880
comparisons that'd be a lot of

1894
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:45,719
fun I mean the rate of the rate of

1895
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,839
vacination is slower as well you know

1896
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:51,000
when it's

1897
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:53,760
cold right little Hill try it yes I

1898
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,158
will I got I got fresh I still have one

1899
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,880
Greenhouse to take

1900
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:59,319
down might happen what do you still have

1901
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,880
to take down this

1902
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:05,119
year uh I got a greenhouse that has

1903
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:09,359
light supplemental lights and uh it's

1904
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:13,760
mostly rs11 and

1905
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:18,039
Skittles yeah man rs1

1906
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:20,480
boy hype all hype 13 minute High

1907
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:22,960
bro I I did a a thing where like I was

1908
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:24,839
doing a review and like as I'm I have

1909
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,198
the camera on me and as I'm talking I

1910
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,960
smoke it and within 13 minutes I am dead

1911
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:32,919
sober after smoking rs11 it killed me

1912
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:35,760
man first time I've seen it I I've only

1913
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:38,600
smoked indoor and and I wasn't impressed

1914
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,239
and I already had the Clone so like you

1915
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,560
know I was still going to go with it and

1916
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:45,399
it looks okay it smells okay it's just

1917
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,080
oh my God like I'm so not stoked on it

1918
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:49,799
and this is usually the best run of the

1919
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:52,359
year is this fall this fall run that

1920
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,960
runs into November yeah um just because

1921
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:56,960
you can get the colors and just

1922
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,079
something about like low light levels

1923
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,198
but also supplemental light and like

1924
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:03,079
cold nights like you can you can really

1925
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:03,960
do some cool things in that greenhouse

1926
01:22:03,079 --> 01:22:06,439
and

1927
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,039
like I got it full of like a strain I

1928
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:10,359
don't give a about but the Skittles

1929
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:14,760
would be good Skittles the Skittles will

1930
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:16,920
taste great um I'm I'm a super fan of uh

1931
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,440
of of that strain and just as far as

1932
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,359
like head stash or something to smoke

1933
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:23,359
that's tasty that's that's what I'm into

1934
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:24,519
anyway so you get old sweet pink

1935
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:28,198
grapefruit by any

1936
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:29,760
chance yes um what do you think about

1937
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,919
boy would I like to have that that

1938
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,360
strain back in something working on it I

1939
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:38,679
only I only grew it once it had an

1940
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:41,719
amazing Funk it was a very like

1941
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:45,399
horizontal grower lateral

1942
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:47,880
brancher um just lime green nugs but but

1943
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:50,559
like just like things don't smell like

1944
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,000
that anymore yeah that's the closest I

1945
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,800
can get to Skittles like trying to

1946
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,840
compare it to or explain to someone who

1947
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,760
used to grow stuff like that is like

1948
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:01,840
grapefruity citrus extreme maybe closest

1949
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,800
to something I remember from SPG like

1950
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,400
the beston I've grapefruit grapefruit

1951
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:10,600
peel is the something I get from it for

1952
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:14,158
sure yeah

1953
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,920
yeah SPG God I wish I still had that is

1954
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:17,158
it

1955
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,000
still the Clone is still live it's in

1956
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,759
Canada we'll work on it we'll see we'll

1957
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,279
see oh man that would be great to CU

1958
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,440
that man like things don't smell like

1959
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:26,039
that anymore no no I think it would blow

1960
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:28,759
people's minds nowaday just kind of like

1961
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:32,319
how Che doely would other like that

1962
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:34,800
it it won't test 30 but you know still

1963
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:36,158
amazing weed yeah yeah you could just

1964
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,639
lie about it just send it to a lab that

1965
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:39,960
lies about their test and just put that

1966
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:42,480
out you know that's how they all do

1967
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,279
anyway I mean that's that's every lab

1968
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:48,000
yeah it's a standard that's how it's all

1969
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:50,800
done so maybe it will maybe it's a 25

1970
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,679
yeah right well we're gonna I think

1971
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,800
we're going to do the that Z episode

1972
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:59,239
next so that could be cool um as

1973
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:01,960
well um chush did you want to PR us with

1974
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:04,718
those questions yeah yeah so um one of

1975
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,920
them was just kind of a a personal

1976
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:09,600
observation that I that like I

1977
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,560
personally like to do in my garden and

1978
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,360
it goes back to triming and the

1979
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:18,440
different morphology of different plants

1980
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:21,359
um I so if I get a golf ball uniformity

1981
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:24,000
nug plant and all of the buds are

1982
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:27,359
conical triang or golf ball decent

1983
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,039
uniformity um I like to let those dry

1984
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:33,319
out a little bit more and so when I'm

1985
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:35,039
trimming these and it it requires a a

1986
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:37,359
dense Bud because you're going to be a

1987
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:39,800
little rough with it but I'll hand trim

1988
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:42,559
I won't use a pair of scissors I use I

1989
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:45,520
I'll put on a pair of black uh nit trial

1990
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:47,960
powderless gloves yeah and the the

1991
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,840
bigger rounder golf ball nugs I'll pick

1992
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,840
the I'll pick the water Leaf off I'll

1993
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:55,159
pick just handpick everything down and

1994
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,360
even sometimes if it's bristly enough or

1995
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:58,920
if it's uh if it's Decay if it's if it's

1996
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:01,759
dry enough you can just brush your

1997
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:04,440
finger across some of the the the Sugar

1998
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,760
Leaf and it falls right off now I I'll

1999
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:08,678
do I'll let I'll let those dry easier

2000
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,520
and it's easier to work with my hands I

2001
01:25:08,679 --> 01:25:13,000
have really big hands all these scissors

2002
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:15,400
are tiny they they my hands cramp up if

2003
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,760
I use the scissors too much but when it

2004
01:25:15,399 --> 01:25:21,198
comes to uh a little bit larier strain

2005
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,719
or a sativa leaner or something that is

2006
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:26,960
just covered in Lea and is a a pain in

2007
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:29,480
the ass to trim I won't let that strain

2008
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,279
get as dry I'll have it just a little

2009
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:34,039
bit wetter so that when I'm working with

2010
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:36,000
it with the scissors H the buds a I can

2011
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:37,399
be a little I can squish the bud down a

2012
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,359
little bit I can morph it around a

2013
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:41,960
little bit and I can work my scissors

2014
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:45,039
around the the content a lot easier so

2015
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:47,480
there there's Nuance to be had like you

2016
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:49,279
you you you can't just subjective or

2017
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:51,799
objectively say that this is the best

2018
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:54,238
time to trim this all of this weed

2019
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,159
because there are certain types of Bud

2020
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,198
that is easier to handle that some you

2021
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:59,479
can trim just by your hand and peeling

2022
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:03,158
stuff off and some that you need a pair

2023
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:05,839
of scissors for um the other oh and the

2024
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:08,079
other thing is the just the powderless

2025
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,679
gloves and working with that like if you

2026
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:13,279
guys like your scissor hash um use the

2027
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:15,440
powderless gloves and do your Charis

2028
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:17,519
like finger hash you know your hands

2029
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:21,079
will get coated with enough hash that

2030
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,679
you can take time oh dude the CH it's

2031
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:24,559
it's some of the best flavors in my

2032
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:26,118
opinion is making that scissor hash or

2033
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,880
that finger hash when your hands are

2034
01:26:26,118 --> 01:26:30,960
coated that's my favorite hash bro and

2035
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,039
it's so easy to do with the powderless

2036
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,239
gloves whether you use latex night trial

2037
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:37,519
as long as it's powderless but the the

2038
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:40,279
finger pressing it literally comes off

2039
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,199
so easily you only need like five or six

2040
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:43,880
thumb presses before it starts

2041
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:46,000
collecting the material to itself and

2042
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,719
it's just the it's just super easy so if

2043
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,399
you guys aren't doing that if you aren't

2044
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:51,520
trimming your stuff with those with

2045
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:53,960
gloves like that and capturing some

2046
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,639
really nice some some good resin I

2047
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:59,800
suggest doing that um and then one thing

2048
01:26:57,639 --> 01:27:02,840
I want to take just quickly though

2049
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:04,119
what's chars without your um skin oils

2050
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,279
Is that

2051
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:10,039
real yeah well think

2052
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:12,158
yeah was going to say it's traditionally

2053
01:27:10,039 --> 01:27:14,800
like yeah you're getting you're getting

2054
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:18,319
all the all the flavors if you think

2055
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:20,119
about it really yeah um and then just

2056
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:22,719
one other thing I wanted to pull back

2057
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:25,039
and talk about and like I I think all of

2058
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:27,560
us have had a friend or know somebody or

2059
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:30,840
have had this experience you go over to

2060
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,639
a buddy's Garden he's growing a really

2061
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,960
good weed amazing weed maybe even better

2062
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,279
weed than you are and you're like dude

2063
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,960
good job keep it up make sure

2064
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:41,039
everything's good and then two weeks

2065
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,520
after harvest and after cure and he's

2066
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:45,880
like man I I don't know what happened

2067
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,880
all this shit's dried out too fast like

2068
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:50,118
there I think we've all seen it where

2069
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,199
somebody grew really amazing weed took

2070
01:27:50,118 --> 01:27:54,198
the diligence to grow the plant all year

2071
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:57,118
long and then just slacked off when it

2072
01:27:54,198 --> 01:27:59,158
came to harvest curing and hang I think

2073
01:27:57,118 --> 01:28:01,679
we all anecdotally have stories of

2074
01:27:59,158 --> 01:28:03,519
friends or people we know that killed it

2075
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,880
during the grow and then slacked off at

2076
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:08,440
the end and like I just

2077
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:11,199
want I just want to reiterate like take

2078
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:13,118
it seriously like do do the due

2079
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:15,759
diligence make sure your growing room is

2080
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:17,920
set up make sure you know you have the

2081
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,560
space and the time planned out for it

2082
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,079
make sure you have the time to trim it

2083
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:24,039
when it's ready to be bucked off the

2084
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:26,840
lines I have personally seen so many

2085
01:28:24,039 --> 01:28:29,238
good Gardens literally just fall apart

2086
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,319
because the gardener at the very end

2087
01:28:29,238 --> 01:28:34,559
just just either hit a complacency wall

2088
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:37,000
or just didn't take the the curing

2089
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,320
Harvest and hanging process seriously

2090
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,399
it's um it's as important and meticulous

2091
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:45,238
as the grow session all year Al and it

2092
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:47,439
it happens in a much smaller crunch of

2093
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:49,718
time but it's ju it's just as important

2094
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:49,719
in my

2095
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
opinion

2096
01:28:54,639 --> 01:29:00,319
so um just to add to the the shus part

2097
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:02,559
what I learned from um our homie at

2098
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:03,920
zomia that goes over there and like does

2099
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,880
that is that a lot of those dudes that

2100
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,359
actually do the shus their their hands

2101
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,920
don't really have a lot of skin cells

2102
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:11,639
come off anymore because their hands are

2103
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,239
so callous from dealing with the

2104
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:18,079
costic turs of and the the cannaboids or

2105
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:20,158
cannaboids whatever of um of that stuff

2106
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,880
their hands are just so freaking callous

2107
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,719
that not a lot don't have there's no

2108
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:28,279
natural oils coming out of their hands

2109
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,560
their crazy yeah that's crazy sounds

2110
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:30,960
brutal but like I thought about it and I

2111
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,960
was like yeah that makes sense like if

2112
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,399
you think about just like getting

2113
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,399
getting you know rubbing against plants

2114
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:39,759
like oh bare arms sometimes you can get

2115
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:41,399
really itchy you know like when you're

2116
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,840
having a heavy trim sesh and your balls

2117
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:48,359
are itchy and you know the the sensitive

2118
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,360
parts of your that Shick could suck

2119
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,880
bro yeah

2120
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:57,560
sorry were there prompts in there for

2121
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:59,560
the others um um no no just like just

2122
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:01,800
the Nuance I've noticed between trimming

2123
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:04,000
different morphology like suggestion for

2124
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,920
the hash and if you want to capture

2125
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,719
capture your scissor hash and your trim

2126
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:12,000
hash uh using the gloves and then just

2127
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:14,920
reiterating the you know take a step

2128
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,399
back and make sure you're the the latter

2129
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:22,039
portion your last 20% is as important as

2130
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:23,279
the 80% that you grew all year or the

2131
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:25,359
that you took to grow it indoors

2132
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:27,118
whatever your frame is you know take

2133
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:28,960
care of the end don't slack off on it

2134
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:31,599
take it seriously I've I've seen a lot

2135
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:33,679
of failures just because people were

2136
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,239
like H you know I'll get around to it or

2137
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,880
it doesn't have to be perfect I grew

2138
01:30:35,238 --> 01:30:38,198
this fire looking weed you know look at

2139
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,440
this this is going to be awesome and

2140
01:30:38,198 --> 01:30:41,559
then it it doesn't turn out like they

2141
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:44,238
thought it was because they didn't take

2142
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:46,360
the last portion of it seriously I've

2143
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:47,799
seen a lot of Growers who are um who

2144
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:49,000
think they're shitty Growers because

2145
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,520
they're not very good at drying and

2146
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,760
curing and vice versa I've seen a lot of

2147
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,760
people think they're great Growers that

2148
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:58,600
that are shitty Growers and and kind of

2149
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:01,239
do okay at the drying and curing part I

2150
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:04,440
want to say that like as a relative

2151
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:06,638
newb um it still scares me not knowing

2152
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:09,638
whether or not if if I get some flower

2153
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,639
that's not so good like I it's still not

2154
01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:14,440
very clear to me whether or not I messed

2155
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:15,600
up in the post Harvest at this point um

2156
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:16,919
and I'm not talking about clones that

2157
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,960
I'm re running they already know of

2158
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,000
course I just mean like you know new new

2159
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,319
plants that I'm trying I'm like is that

2160
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,439
because I miss upop at the end I don't

2161
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:27,679
know I'm going to have to rerun it and

2162
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:29,198
see if it's the same or you know I'm

2163
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,399
going to have to try and Vary something

2164
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:34,439
in my dry cure to see if it makes any

2165
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,599
difference um I I guess what I'm trying

2166
01:31:34,439 --> 01:31:39,158
to say is that like I don't feel like I

2167
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,760
have that much certainty when it comes

2168
01:31:39,158 --> 01:31:44,599
to the end product quality and knowing

2169
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,880
like exactly where things may have gone

2170
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:51,000
good or bad yet I'm hoping to like

2171
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:53,039
obviously develop that over time um but

2172
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,719
it's so complex that I'm like this could

2173
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:57,238
have gone wrong at like any of these

2174
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,639
points I don't know it could just be

2175
01:31:57,238 --> 01:32:00,039
like a shitty expression from the

2176
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:03,159
genetics and that's just how it's it

2177
01:32:00,039 --> 01:32:05,399
could be the genetics as well yes yeah

2178
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:09,279
exactly so I'm still yeah still getting

2179
01:32:05,399 --> 01:32:09,279
there still working my way there

2180
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:13,519
yeah um I thought otherwise we could

2181
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,039
just open the floor like anything you

2182
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:18,840
know anything that comes to mind for you

2183
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:20,679
guys around any of these topics uh any

2184
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,400
of your any Reflections on like your

2185
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:25,560
most recent Harvest anything like that

2186
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:27,559
um gonna going to throw the indoor guys

2187
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:30,360
under the bus a bit and say one of yours

2188
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:32,119
to respond in some way um I was kind of

2189
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:34,880
gonna ask

2190
01:32:32,118 --> 01:32:37,920
actually um do any of you guys look at

2191
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:40,039
like the pistol development at all uh in

2192
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,840
terms of like looking when to harvest

2193
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:43,960
and all of that

2194
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,840
or I don't know it's kind of just

2195
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:49,439
something like I've

2196
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:53,079
never really used it but I don't know I

2197
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:56,238
kind of just see that it like

2198
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:59,279
correlate heavily I I mean like if if I

2199
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:01,799
still see white pistols or or stigma at

2200
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:03,079
the end of harvest I'm like I'm I'm

2201
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,480
thinking that I probably screwed up

2202
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:06,960
somewhere if I know that this should be

2203
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:08,559
done and I'm seeing a bunch of you know

2204
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,639
my hair sticking out but at the same

2205
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,400
time like there are some plants that

2206
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,440
will never stop throwing that like Kim

2207
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:16,839
91 stuff like that when it's grown right

2208
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:18,638
so it's it's up in the air just where

2209
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:20,800
you like to high it's funny you mention

2210
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,118
that the Kim 91 S1 that I got going out

2211
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,360
right now it's it has like one or two

2212
01:33:23,118 --> 01:33:28,000
white pistols still sticking out the top

2213
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,799
of it endless and she actually she

2214
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,479
retained a couple of her pink pistols

2215
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:34,560
too I was really this laid into it yeah

2216
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:36,638
I was really surprised to see pink like

2217
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,880
on the top of every cola two or three

2218
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:41,079
Pink Pistols usually I'm used to seeing

2219
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,079
those Fade Away pretty yeah pretty early

2220
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:44,118
into

2221
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:46,000
flower yeah so there's there's a lot of

2222
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:47,839
strains that do that and like you just

2223
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,118
kind of have to know which or which like

2224
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,760
I was talking about the Bundy sis S1 cut

2225
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:54,000
earlier that thing will do it it's just

2226
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,920
like endless ugly ass white hairs it

2227
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,118
looks like it got shocked you know like

2228
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,440
one of the traits of it yeah I mean I

2229
01:33:58,118 --> 01:34:02,079
guess it just depends on the genetics

2230
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,678
and stuff and what the way some some

2231
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,319
strings just do I mean most of them tend

2232
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:08,158
to the hairs die off and you know it's

2233
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:09,840
you know maybe not time to harvest but

2234
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:12,519
you know it's at least been pollinated

2235
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,760
or hand fumbled or whatever you know

2236
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,440
there's it means all sorts of different

2237
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:21,159
things when the hair's Brown

2238
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:23,799
up yeah LEDs too hot yeah something I

2239
01:34:21,158 --> 01:34:24,879
look at is like once most of the hairs

2240
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:28,520
are

2241
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:30,000
turned like like a majority of them

2242
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:33,719
especially on the

2243
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:36,039
tops um I I know that like Harvest is

2244
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:39,158
probably about two weeks

2245
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:43,000
away um at least this is this is

2246
01:34:39,158 --> 01:34:46,719
outdoors this is greenhouse

2247
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,560
um like once they all kind of turned

2248
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,480
then you're going to start really to see

2249
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:55,440
you're really going to start seeing

2250
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:57,039
swelling in in the nugs and uh you know

2251
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,439
you're still about two weeks

2252
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:01,000
away I have a question for you do you

2253
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:02,799
see a lot of pollen contamination out

2254
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,880
where you're growing outdoor like from

2255
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:09,520
other Farms blown in not where I am at

2256
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:13,199
all um

2257
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:16,239
never um unless I'm contaminating myself

2258
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:19,158
yeah right yeah can

2259
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:20,879
happen but uh in town like down in

2260
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:22,319
Garberville or Redway if you're grown in

2261
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,359
your backyard

2262
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:26,238
like you'll get seeds and everything

2263
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:27,880
every year that's funny dude I'd be soad

2264
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:30,118
some years some years worse cuz like

2265
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:32,400
people are like some people are

2266
01:35:30,118 --> 01:35:34,920
flowering males out in their backyard to

2267
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:37,599
bring up to their their Garden up up

2268
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:39,639
somewhere else and yeah I mean it's town

2269
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,159
and and there's weed in everybody's

2270
01:35:39,639 --> 01:35:43,279
backyard and you don't know what kind of

2271
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:46,559
garbage they're growing or Hermes or

2272
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:49,079
what I know man but so that's fairly

2273
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:52,679
common in town but out here just

2274
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:55,319
especially where I am no way um just

2275
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:58,118
because I'm there's there's nobody

2276
01:35:55,319 --> 01:36:02,519
really growing weed very close to me and

2277
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:04,279
it's very windy so I mean no I've never

2278
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,719
had an issue with it I did have a

2279
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:10,000
neighbor with a mail plant I saw one

2280
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:12,118
time and I just kind of barked at him to

2281
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,158
cut it down out of here or

2282
01:36:12,118 --> 01:36:17,359
or I would do it for

2283
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:20,559
him this is r a random that was too

2284
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:22,118
early I had I had a her me plant this

2285
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,480
year um

2286
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:28,039
in my Skittles Skittles sherbet cross

2287
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:30,439
yeah um one of them straight up hered

2288
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:33,359
more male flowers than than

2289
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:35,599
female and uh I caught it I caught it

2290
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,158
early enough um I haven't I haven't

2291
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,639
really trimmed up that weed yet so I

2292
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:40,559
don't know if it's seated but I kind of

2293
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,079
doubt it just yeah just from looking at

2294
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,039
all the male flowers and and the weed

2295
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:48,279
around it the the the the females around

2296
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:51,679
it like I'm I don't I don't think it

2297
01:36:48,279 --> 01:36:55,719
Herm um I mean I don't think get uh

2298
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:58,960
seated yeah yeah was but other than that

2299
01:36:55,719 --> 01:37:00,719
like yeah pretty good way to get

2300
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,359
on your neighbor's bad side if if you

2301
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:03,359
got a bunch of stray pollen running

2302
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:06,158
around your

2303
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:08,359
property I was going to say like is have

2304
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:10,359
yall witnessed or heard of any like

2305
01:37:08,359 --> 01:37:13,479
spiteful individuals who've gone and

2306
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:18,118
like pollinated someone's Garden because

2307
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:21,678
they no but not pollinated but but if a

2308
01:37:18,118 --> 01:37:24,158
neighbor had pollinated your garden

2309
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:27,319
accidentally and theirs most likely

2310
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:29,799
that's that's definitely happened and

2311
01:37:27,319 --> 01:37:31,639
yeah that that can cause some problems

2312
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,719
I've heard of lots of lawsuits you know

2313
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:35,520
I've heard some stories in Trinity Pines

2314
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:37,359
where guys were using drones and they

2315
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:40,119
were pollinating other people's Farms

2316
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:43,238
with drones that's epic wow that's

2317
01:37:40,118 --> 01:37:45,960
that's pretty up yeah that's like

2318
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:47,959
epic hate bro Trinity Pines is pretty

2319
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:52,599
crazy though it gets pretty wild up

2320
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:55,039
there that's funny man

2321
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:55,039
bunch of

2322
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:01,359
dicks yeah there's been a lot of L seats

2323
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:03,760
especially during the hemp stuff um

2324
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:06,079
whether it was you know hot hemp or you

2325
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,639
know like it's supposed to be fem seed

2326
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:10,039
and all of a sudden it's all pollinated

2327
01:38:07,639 --> 01:38:11,599
their people like Chad suing like the

2328
01:38:10,039 --> 01:38:12,560
the people they had do it or whoever

2329
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:15,360
because they didn't understand what

2330
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:18,159
feminized meant or any of it like that

2331
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:20,439
was pretty common yeah also they were

2332
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:23,000
they were putting out like really un un

2333
01:38:20,439 --> 01:38:25,399
untested seed for the most part that's

2334
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,158
that that happened big time in Applegate

2335
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:31,359
Applegate Valley in in southern Oregon

2336
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:35,679
um bunch of hemp farmers in the valley

2337
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:37,759
seated up everybody's selia crop

2338
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:40,399
and uh I think that I think that cause

2339
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:43,079
cause some problems I I could only

2340
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:45,559
imagine yeah if somebody seated my crop

2341
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:49,079
what would happen like I don't think I

2342
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:51,239
would sue them but like you can't

2343
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:53,920
with somebody's livelihood like that and

2344
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:56,079
honestly like there is you are liable in

2345
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:59,118
the in the era of legalization you're

2346
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:01,559
super liable yeah for ruining somebody's

2347
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:03,598
agricultural crop yeah especially if the

2348
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:07,760
person's legal you know what I mean like

2349
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:11,960
yeah you definitely love oh yeah so I

2350
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,960
don't know still L catch your ass

2351
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:21,198
whooping um I had a question also for

2352
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,520
you outdoor Growers so like once you

2353
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:27,238
guys see like betrus and whatnot um on

2354
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:29,360
an outdoor crop is that like signs to

2355
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:33,319
harvest that right now or kind of just

2356
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:36,319
cut it and let it go and and harvest it

2357
01:39:33,319 --> 01:39:38,960
or like how do you guys deal with that I

2358
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:42,238
think it depends on where you are like

2359
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:43,800
how close to harvest are you it it your

2360
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:46,479
petritis could have been caused by

2361
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,520
caterpillars in which case cut it out

2362
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:51,919
and let it

2363
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:54,360
ride um but like if you see betri

2364
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,039
like you might go another week before

2365
01:39:54,359 --> 01:40:00,079
you see betrus again on on the same

2366
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:01,760
plant or on the same strain so in that

2367
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:05,679
case you just got to start monitoring

2368
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:08,679
and looking closer once you see it until

2369
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,760
it it gets to the point where like okay

2370
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:13,960
I saw three new spots today tomorrow I'm

2371
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:16,480
going to see 10 new spots cut it you

2372
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,399
know so it like it kind of progressively

2373
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:19,319
gets worse and you got to know when to

2374
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:22,679
cut your

2375
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:25,439
losses yeah think that's the Harvest

2376
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:27,920
Time thing like okay like okay where I

2377
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,039
think we're g to you know we got 10

2378
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,480
spots of mold today let's let's Harvest

2379
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:34,000
tomorrow because it's just going to get

2380
01:40:31,479 --> 01:40:37,399
worse and so that's that's your Harvest

2381
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,599
timing right there it's molding you know

2382
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:42,319
right I think it also depends on

2383
01:40:39,599 --> 01:40:44,800
infection location um you know if it's

2384
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:48,198
in the base of a main Cola as opposed to

2385
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:50,320
a lower tier Branch or a little snug or

2386
01:40:48,198 --> 01:40:53,559
if it's on the main stem near the near

2387
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:56,719
the base of the the plant there's the

2388
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:59,440
I've noticed in my garden usually it

2389
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:02,560
only propagates where there's dead cell

2390
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:06,238
material if there's dead plant material

2391
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:09,360
for it to grow off of or in the instance

2392
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:13,559
of caterpillars it's uh it's their

2393
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:16,039
I've noticed that the the the the

2394
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:18,679
proliferation of it starts where their

2395
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:21,279
is just resting on a flower so it

2396
01:41:18,679 --> 01:41:24,118
kind of depends on the infection site

2397
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:26,840
depends on if I take that Branch or if I

2398
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:29,000
take just the tip of the cola off or if

2399
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:32,840
I take the whole thing or if I take the

2400
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,439
whole plant yeah there's just just the

2401
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:37,760
tip

2402
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:38,839
I I had a question about bet tritis I

2403
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,520
think this one's for locco because I

2404
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,199
think locco and I had a little talk

2405
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:45,560
about this I don't know how long ago but

2406
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:48,638
so far mostly when we talk about Bettis

2407
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,400
we consider it to be like an exogenous

2408
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:53,319
uh or like kind of caused by like

2409
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:56,000
exogenous factors like caterpillars uh

2410
01:41:53,319 --> 01:41:57,679
humidity Etc but lo you were you

2411
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,118
mentioned to me that there was also a

2412
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:02,719
notion of systemic petritis I don't even

2413
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:05,359
know if that's the right term for it but

2414
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:09,800
was that something we were talking

2415
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:11,880
about um I think we have um and like I

2416
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,079
think it's kind of like never really

2417
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:15,719
been settled if it's systemic or not

2418
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:18,079
systemic I don't

2419
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:21,319
know it's not really what do we mean

2420
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:24,639
here when we say systemic okay okay yeah

2421
01:42:21,319 --> 01:42:26,759
yeah um but like systemic I guess it's

2422
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,560
like if if one part of the plant has it

2423
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:31,920
like the rest of it is or can have it

2424
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,920
type of

2425
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:36,079
deal but yeah

2426
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:45,479
yeah anything else from anyone uh

2427
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:51,238
er no I mean I think like what you guys

2428
01:42:49,599 --> 01:42:52,719
have been talking about are been great

2429
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:55,039
points and just like what kush was

2430
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:59,079
saying like the biggest thing that has

2431
01:42:55,039 --> 01:43:00,880
helped me um is to just be prepared for

2432
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:02,118
what you're doing you know like know

2433
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,880
like how many plants you're going to be

2434
01:43:02,118 --> 01:43:07,118
taking down make sure you have a space

2435
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:10,400
ready for it um you know make sure you

2436
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:12,479
have your environmental kind of like

2437
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:15,359
thing like environmental controllers and

2438
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:17,718
stuff like that in place before uh you

2439
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:20,118
go you know because once you once you

2440
01:43:17,719 --> 01:43:22,760
take them down they're drying whether

2441
01:43:20,118 --> 01:43:25,639
you like it or not uh whether you're in

2442
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:27,400
good conditions or bad you know so just

2443
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:29,000
be prepared for it you know I think

2444
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:32,960
that's the best way like to set yourself

2445
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:36,039
up for Success yep oh one other thing I

2446
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:38,560
wanted to add was uh people who are very

2447
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:41,479
meticulous about scoping Tricom Amber

2448
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:44,239
and cloudiness um a lot of people don't

2449
01:43:41,479 --> 01:43:46,919
take into account that when you chop the

2450
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:49,479
plant and hang it that uh maturation

2451
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,679
still goes so and it varies with strains

2452
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:54,319
it varies with environments I've seen

2453
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:56,480
some that have 20% Amber tricomes jump

2454
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,639
up to 40 by the time hang is done and

2455
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,319
I've seen some that only add like 5%

2456
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:03,960
more so that it's another Nuance

2457
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:05,920
subjective like you have to you have to

2458
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,158
get in there and and work with the

2459
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,760
plants to understand what it's going to

2460
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,479
do I've wondered about this too

2461
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:14,159
especially because uh it takes so much

2462
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:15,439
longer for me to dry in the fridge I I

2463
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:17,198
often have thought about that like

2464
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:18,919
whether or not that that process you

2465
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:22,598
know obviously will continue but at what

2466
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,599
rate yeah right

2467
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:32,719
yeah I mean if nothing else we can

2468
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:34,000
probably call it a WP yeah I think we're

2469
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,000
right about that

2470
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,719
range and then possibly maybe an idea

2471
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,960
for the next episode is uh just talking

2472
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:43,599
about what we grew I mean for an outdoor

2473
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,359
Round Table what we grew this year what

2474
01:44:43,599 --> 01:44:48,800
we liked what worked well we might go

2475
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:50,799
for next year and get a get a get

2476
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:53,320
another hour and a half two hour

2477
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,760
discussion going on that because I I

2478
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:56,799
could talk about plenty of that as well

2479
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:58,440
too I'm already excited for next year's

2480
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,000
grow and I'm not even done trimming this

2481
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:03,198
year and I'm I'm chomping at the

2482
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,760
bit I'm definitely ready for some like

2483
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:05,919
offseason content because I imagine

2484
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,760
there's there's a lot of prep that you

2485
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,239
guys have to do anyway in the offseason

2486
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,960
thinking planning Etc so I think that

2487
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:13,439
could be cool for sure I want to see you

2488
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,920
guys go through the jars and like

2489
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:16,719
describe each one as you go through it

2490
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:18,639
and what nuances you look for and how

2491
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:19,760
you assess your weed and like all that

2492
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,159
stuff because I think people be really

2493
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:24,000
into that yeah that seems to be why they

2494
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:25,839
like the reviews that I do is because

2495
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,279
they're someone that has experience with

2496
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,800
something giving them a real realistic

2497
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:31,599
on theground idea of what this thing

2498
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,279
smells and tastes like and all that so I

2499
01:45:31,599 --> 01:45:35,400
think people would be into it call it

2500
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:37,880
call it like a jar talk have a round

2501
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:40,399
table called jar talk jar jar talk I

2502
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:43,639
like that I also want to kind of credit

2503
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:45,399
Kush by the way for this episode um he

2504
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:47,400
actually wrote up a bunch of these

2505
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:49,479
questions and and and the outline and

2506
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:51,359
I'm stoked because it's the first time

2507
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:54,198
someone else has done it instead of me

2508
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:56,279
yeah I'm like yeah that's awesome and so

2509
01:45:54,198 --> 01:45:58,319
you know maybe the next one you may we

2510
01:45:56,279 --> 01:46:00,800
we may not need both you know me and

future getting more outdoor cats on and

2515
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:11,158

01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:13,959
where both you guys don't even need to

2517
