to the point when actually having like

125
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,799
an interest in what was going on and

126
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,879
seeing like a high times magazines and

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,960
[ __ ] like that or little a little bit

128
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,639
before high times probably a year before

129
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,758
i saw the high times

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
um

131
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,479
we like started there was i i used to

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,800
live up at um

133
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,800
uh what's ariel 101 now which was

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
originally check lodge or grape wine

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
station and

136
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,038
i like that was the first time i ever

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,199
saw indoor was there's this big shed

138
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,759
still there if you 101. you can see it's

139
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,038
this big steel building like just past

140
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,360
the creek

141
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,000
and i remember going in there and there

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,199
was like the the big parabolic thousand

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,839
watt lights

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,038
and seeing these big thin leaf plants

145
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,879
that were like

146
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,639
to me they were huge but i was like

147
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,639
eight and a half or nine so they were

148
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,879
probably like

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,319
no six feet six foot tall plants or

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,839
something they seemed huge and i

151
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,159
remember him being like up on a little

152
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,560
platform kinda and then the light

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
being all the way near up by the roof

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,199
and being a few feet apart and that was

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
like my first time seeing [ __ ] like that

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,560
and then right around then

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,959
was when my mom was given that that um

158
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,519
manila envelope that was that had seeds

159
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,079
in it to grow indoor and it was like you

160
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,680
got to have indoor seeds to grow indoors

161
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,279
we thought which turns out it's not true

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
we didn't realize it until like the mid

163
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,799
90s when i tried growing a bunch of

164
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,400
different other [ __ ] randomly which most

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
of it didn't really work out to be that

166
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,478
dank but at least you could you could do

167
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,918
it it was weed and then all weed was

168
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,359
weak it didn't matter if it was as

169
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,279
killer as the northern lights but the

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,400
northern lights was killer and that's

171
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,799
what was in that envelope and uh

172
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,359
my mom popped a few of those she got one

173
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
plant that was a female she saved some

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
of the other ones we ended up planning

175
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,879
those years later when i lived in

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,600
healdsburg down in sonoma county that

177
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,600
was like 90

178
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,239
90

179
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,478
493 i want to say it was eighth grade

180
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,639
for me

181
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,399
so it had to be right around in that in

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,800
that time period and um

183
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,719
so that was but that was like the first

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
strain i remember having where it like

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
had a name was northern lights

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
and then when i was a kid i didn't know

187
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,319
about it but my mom and and her

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,519
boyfriend like uh who's like my dad

189
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
george

190
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,399
they had stuff that they got that was um

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
they got this stuff from a friend out in

192
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,399
george's neighborhood that was the that

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,800
was uh the missouri

194
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,478
and they really liked it and then

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
i was talking to george the other day

196
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:23,038
and he said that about 70 in about 76 he

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,038
was in san francisco at the beach and

198
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,598
these dudes had brought back a couple

199
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,279
pounds of seeds from afghanistan and he

200
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,199
said that was the time you ever saw

201
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,679
afghani weed which was interesting to me

202
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,759
because i i thought more like here the

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,280
other stories i know are more like 84

204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,639
humboldt 78 so he was like no it was 76

205
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,959
and that was the first stuff and he goes

206
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
that was different than the missouri

207
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,198
that and that i got from charlie brown

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
and um so he was telling me that and

209
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,000
that was cool because it's all this time

210
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,879
and i still you still get new

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,959
information right yeah

212
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,720
so that was cool [ __ ] and then uh

213
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,000
he was like i wish i would i wish i

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
would have hung on to some of those

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
those were really killer and the

216
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:07,758
missouri was a much bigger plant with

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,919
like the big long buds and yeah um

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,879
so but that was that was before my time

219
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,240
but that was like you know stuff that

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,319
was

221
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
it had i been aware of what was going on

222
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,479
that was stuff that was being grown you

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
know yeah but yeah

224
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,680
but yeah so then so then really the

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,879
northern lights was like that first

226
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
thing

227
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
and then i remember that being around

228
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,918
and uh

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,918
the first clone i can remember

230
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,598
besides that which is probably around

231
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,360
the same time if not

232
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,599
right at the same time i remember willow

233
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,320
had just come out the movie willow right

234
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
yeah yeah so that's 89 i think

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,200
and we

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,278
this lady's house up in leggett and she

237
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
had this weed that was purple

238
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,159
which was really cool because to me like

239
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,919
i had always seen you know pot like

240
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,000
still what i call pot like is like

241
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,838
general weed it's not really

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
not any distinction you're just talking

243
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,720
about some pot has some pot right

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,759
she had some [ __ ] that was

245
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,560
purple weed and the smell of that is

246
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:14,080
still what i smell in the urcle and

247
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,919
um

248
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
like when i do all the breeding with the

249
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,919
cherry pie i'll get these ones where

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,759
like when i label my bags so that i

251
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,799
remember what kind of plan it was the

252
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,879
throw

253
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,879
like legit purple smell

254
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,720
on it to like so that i know like this

255
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,639
is that one that's kind of like that and

256
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
that used to pop out the stuff i had

257
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,600
called the big red too

258
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,919
um and if you really grew a lot of deep

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,240
chunk the sweeter ones you'll get some

260
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,039
that are really more that style and then

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,919
i even got a lot of that smell

262
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,079
when i smelled a flat that a dude had

263
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,679
brought to the emerald cup that was um i

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,160
think it was green source gardens

265
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,319
brought a flat of all these afghanis

266
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,039
that were recently imported

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
and

268
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,079
he had grown them to see what was in

269
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,000
them and some of them were good some of

270
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
them were bad some of them smelled like

271
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
cheesy they were all different smells

272
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,078
but a couple of them had that smell that

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
i was like that's like that that legit

274
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,278
purple smell you know and it's easy

275
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
because

276
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,799
it's an early smell right like you know

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
what it smelled like the first time you

278
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,000
smelled someone cooked broccoli yeah the

279
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,639
first time

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,360
nail polish remover or like it's like a

281
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,360
smell that really stuck with me um so

282
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
those are like the two oldest things and

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,079
that clone resurfaced when i was living

284
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,039
out in this neighborhood west to here

285
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,319
um

286
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:35,120
and it was a lady who i was staying with

287
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,440
and her neighbor who's a guy who what i

288
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,799
call perp came from which is the purple

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,560
stemmed stuff that wound up being real

290
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,799
and uh

291
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,958
they both were growing it and i saw and

292
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,399
i was like oh this is that [ __ ] and and

293
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,719
and it turned out it did come from the

294
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,958
same lady and um

295
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,600
you know for me that was a really long

296
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,958
time apart but for those adults it was

297
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,839
just a little while right now you know

298
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,838
how it is four or five years

299
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,278
there was that so there was those and

300
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
then um

301
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,759
you know

302
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,519
around back in those days i didn't see a

303
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,879
whole lot of different stuff i remember

304
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,039
seeing like some

305
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,799
some brick weed that was supposed to be

306
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,199
um

307
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,039
that was supposed to be tie and i don't

308
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,759
know if what it was but it was very

309
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,000
string very dark very compressed not a

310
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,679
lot to it but people who smoked it would

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
get the giggles really [ __ ] bad and

312
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,958
get higher than a kite it was way

313
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,639
different than other like

314
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,919
the other like bricky weed that i've

315
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,759
seen or like when i bought like

316
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,679
colombian brick for

317
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,919
20 for you know

318
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,399
what you know 20 bucks a quarter pound

319
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,479
or some [ __ ] or 100 per pound in costa

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,159
rica you like go through the whole thing

321
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
and you get like a cup you get a little

322
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,838
bit of bud and the rest is all a bunch

323
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,159
of garbage and then yeah you smoke it

324
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,480
you get high for 15 minutes you fall

325
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,399
asleep you wake up with a headache like

326
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,759
this wasn't like that so i was like yeah

327
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,360
it could have been maybe it was thai

328
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,200
weed i don't know like someone had had

329
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,959
put away or something

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,879
but that's so that's like going up you

331
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,039
know not a lot of different variety that

332
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,480
i can really remember

333
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,240
all the way

334
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,120
until

335
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,839
93-94

336
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,759
and in that era old-school smokers

337
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,800
remember it was like somebody passed you

338
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,278
a joint

339
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,838
and if you're like if you're like a real

340
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,078
weed head and you really know your [ __ ]

341
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,079
you're not like is this

342
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,719
the burps is this

343
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,838
sour diesel you're like is it bud and

344
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,160
they're like yeah it's bud and you're

345
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,760
like all right and then you smoke but

346
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,519
you know if they're like oh it's shake

347
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,519
you're like oh no i don't want to smoke

348
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,440
that so back then

349
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,879
didn't get attached to stuff very much

350
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,680
it was either like this shit's really

351
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,278
killer or it's not that killer and then

352
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,679
uh

353
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,399
around i guess it was around 94.

354
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,879
i

355
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
i started hanging out i had been living

356
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,278
in healsburg for like a year and it

357
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,959
sucked i went to eighth grade down there

358
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,360
and uh

359
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,919
most people were square or the people

360
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,759
who weren't square were skaters and they

361
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,799
were pretty pretty soon to turn into

362
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,559
tweakers once they hit high school later

363
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,759
yeah

364
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,439
and uh

365
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,799
and then like the mexican dudes were

366
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
really cool to me

367
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,799
and the skaters were really cool to me

368
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,039
but the squares were kind of like ah

369
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,199
this dude's like you kind of tell i was

370
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,039
like more of a stoner guy right

371
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
well it was kind of weird going to a new

372
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,278
school because it was real there was

373
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
more of that separation i live in a real

374
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,600
small town when i was going to school

375
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,360
before that and there's not enough kids

376
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,879
for there to be any separation because

377
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
you can't have a whole group of one

378
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,000
thing or there's just three guys or

379
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,440
whatever right

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,720
so

381
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,600
basically

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
i was down there and then i came back up

383
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240

00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,759
plants by the location like this is this

410
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,159

416
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
never really thought of it and then

417
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,519
there was tall marks which came from the

418
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,399
the taller mark you know the other guy

419
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,320

420
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,000
taller and so they had all these

421
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
different [ __ ] and they would be like oh

422
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,078
and all these ones are tasty and those

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,920
ones aren't and i was like damn okay

424
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,958
[ __ ] i didn't really know anything about

425
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,879
that with weed like flavors and exactly

426
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,039
what they were i just knew like i still

427
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,879
to get high and i would smoke and they'd

428
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,039
look at me and they'd be like

429
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,838
they'd be like um

430
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,879
uh

431
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
you know

432
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,480
why do you make that face when you when

433
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
you i get like the bitter weed face

434
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,240
right maybe like why you don't like the

435
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,919
smoke and i'd be like nah i mean you

436
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
know if you kind of cough out smoke and

437
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,639
[ __ ] it's all harsh and all that yeah

438
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,638
and so then i wound up having a little

439
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,159
bit of the northern lights

440
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,079
and they smoked it and they're all

441
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,919
that's tasty and i was like oh this is

442
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,000
tasty okay [ __ ] i've just been like

443
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,198
choking on it you know

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
paying attention to how they were

445
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,919
smoking hitting it a little lighter

446
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,680
taking it the deep inhale blowing out

447
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,360
the smoke before you cough like the

448
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,359
basic things you know you're more

449
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,519
seasoned smoker when i was a kid you

450
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,759
know and so um

451
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,000
then that was when i started to then see

452
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,159
all the variety and when we would go to

453
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
school you know we'd smoke at lunch and

454
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,600
people would bring the stuff from their

455
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,079
parents and we'd find out what they had

456
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,560
in bell springs what they had in spyro

457
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,638
what's what this girl's dad grew or what

458
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,078
this girl's dad got from

459
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
from you know

460
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,198
bill graham presents people give it

461
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
hooking them up weed because they were

462
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,120
it was the people who were into that you

463
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,078
know all the dead [ __ ] and

464
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,919
um

465
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,638
so then like then i started to see more

466
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,719
of the variety and uh in that time

467
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,639
period around then a little later was

468
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
when i saw like the effects which is

469
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,759
what you know like uh

470
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
uh

471
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,000
i think crossed the mendo p with the

472
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,479
with the effects to make purple effects

473
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,360
which became really popular and is in

474
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
some of the most popular things now

475
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,560
um

476
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,560
stuff that we called garlic bud that i

477
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,239
don't know that it was garlic bud as far

478
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,479
as the strain but it was really that

479
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,318
crazy gnarly

480
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,558
it's like even more gnarly than deep

481
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,399
chunk where the the bracts grow like

482
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,480
from the center of the bud all the way

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,360
out like they're really long and narrow

484
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,279
and caked with resin and almost out

485
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,119
inside with the purple stripes and the

486
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,599
crazy funk and

487
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,519
um around then two was when i first saw

488
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,879
like big blue

489
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,119
um

490
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,319
and then you know going into the later

491
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,078
90s

492
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,918
uh we saw

493
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,839
monkey balls which people call deep

494
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,480
chunk

495
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,159
and

496
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,000
um

497
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,320
you know then right around then was when

498
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,640
you start to get the clone wave and that

499
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,918
was when we got things like sweat

500
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,080
train wreck

501
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,880
mr nice guy

502
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,000
green queen did you ever see snurvel up

503
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,679
there

504
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,519
i never saw nerville i've heard of it

505
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,919
but we did never

506
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,759
snow bud we did see

507
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,679
um

508
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,079
what was in the same old time period i

509
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,960
mean a little later was blue dream snow

510
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,240
cap

511
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
um

512
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,160
but there was one that was really

513
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,960
popular and humble called the mist which

514
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,279
was

515
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,519
supposedly like a matanuska mist thing

516
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,519
or something and

517
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,440
people really loved it who loved it now

518
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,200
people say it's minty it doesn't have

519
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,279
much but it was a really beautiful plant

520
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,880
it got these really nice buds that were

521
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,359
kind of shaped like this and they were

522
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,200
just chunky and covered in resin and i

523
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,798
crossed that with a big blue and i got a

524
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
couple great plants out of that that

525
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,119
were really nice but it's because they

526
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,879
kind of lean to the blue side on flavor

527
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,879
it wasn't the most

528
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
outstanding ship it was really popular

529
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,080
and humble for people to crop that that

530
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:43,038
mr nice train wreck

531
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,199
dream queen

532
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,279
did you see that uh did you used to see

533
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,480
that blueberry skunk

534
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,879
that uh remember sasso had that and like

535
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,640
like guys like tony mendo and craig and

536
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,919
all those dudes that way back when we're

537
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,600
kind of working with him did you ever

538
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,720
see any of that blueberry skunk that he

539
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,599
ran

540
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,839
i'm not sure man we had one up here that

541
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,199
my buddy called

542
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,959
super skunk

543
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,279
and it was not super skunk he said it's

544
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,919
blueberry northern lights

545
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,000
and it's very resonance and to me it

546
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
smells almost like penny royal

547
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,279
or like a hint of spearmint or something

548
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,399
it's it more in that realm of

549
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,399
like

550
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
i don't want to say herby but it's that

551
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,919
kind of a thing where it's like that

552
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,558
really cuts through you know how

553
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,799
peppermint is or penny royal if you bend

554
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:35,119
is it's like it's like that really

555
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:37,119
like sharp herbal funk and uh

556
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,159
that one was cool and i don't i mean i

557
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,918
don't know if that would have been the

558
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
same thing i mean he called it super

559
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,679
skunk he knew it was blueberry northern

560
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,678
lights so maybe that was kind of a

561
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
similar thing i don't know i don't think

562
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,360
i don't think that blueberry skunk was

563
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,399
related to anything we call blueberry

564
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,399
today

565
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
you know uh in terms of what became

566
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,440
famous and associated with

567
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
you know but yeah

568
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,919
but it was kind of like that i would say

569
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,640
like the late 90s there was kind of like

570
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
like he was saying like you

571
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,799
maybe the late 90s early 2000s was

572
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,640
really when like the name strain game

573
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,759
really began

574
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
because

575
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,000
like what he was saying i remember stuff

576
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:20,519
where most of the time weed was talked

577
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,519
about like where it was from

578
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,038
yeah

579
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,038

581
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,798
don't leave that because

582
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,200
that whole era when i talked about all

583
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,359
those clones at the same time everybody

584
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,440

589
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,319

590
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,558

you cross into humboldt from mendocino

664
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,759
county you're basically at

665
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,038
uh you're basically at the festival and

666
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,720
that's kind of where

667
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,038
everyone would gather

668
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,480
in uh in the middle of summer and see a

669
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,798
bunch of reggae it was kind of like one

670
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,000
of the few things that would like happen

671
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,759
up there

672
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you know and when i was i'm a little

673
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,558
older than than gene i came out to see

674
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,079
the dead in the in the 90s and then

675
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,399
obviously there's a connection between

676
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,879
the bay and humboldt mendo

677
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,600
and so i got dragged up there

678
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,760
and i have in 95 i think it was 94 95

679
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,240
was the first time i came to mendo

680
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,400
um and i went to uh we went to reggae on

681
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,919
the river in humble and there's like two

682
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,080
things that will stand out for me

683
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,520
forever from being from the midwest and

684
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,678
coming from a police state one was a guy

685
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,918
walking up and down and selling buds and

686
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,320
the buds were like in a five gallon

687
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,360
paint bucket with the colas sticking out

688
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:22,319
the top and just like the ability for

689
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:24,719
someone to like walk around openly

690
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,960
and and show wheat

691
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,360
yeah which was so sketch where i came

692
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,480
from was like crazy and then if people

693
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,439
have never been there there's like uh

694
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
um

695
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,798
like the river runs through it right

696
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,240
there and you can kind of like look up

697
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,639
and there's like cliffs and where the

698
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,558
cliffs are that's where the 101 is you

699
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,840
know and so they'd have a bunch of at

700
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,200
certain parts of it at least and so

701
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,359
they'd have a bunch of cops up there

702
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,038
directing traffic and all that

703
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,839
and i had friends that were like in the

704
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,480
know

705
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,199
so we got like uh you know riverfront

706
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,960
camping which is kind of nice right and

707
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
i'm pulling tubes

708
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,079
you know i'm pulling i'm pulling a tube

709
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,278
and i look up and there's a cop looking

710
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,798
at me

711
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,558
right would you like where i'm from is

712
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,119
like an immediate bust

713
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,879
yeah yeah and he just waved

714
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,399
and let me go on about my business and

715
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,480
when i was like 18 or something like

716
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
that 19 that was like the most shocking

717
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,278
thing

718
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,639
for sure that a cop and i could like

719
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,038
look at each other

720
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,679
from a distance and like he sees me

721
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,440
doing drugs essentially yeah and he just

722
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,120
waves and goes on about it instead of

723
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,600
like radioing me in and i was like ready

724
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,278
to like throw the bong and run

725
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,959
because that was training

726
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,720
yeah that was like kind of like my that

727
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,880
was one of my first inclinations that

728
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,919
like living up here was kind of a total

729
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
bubble

730
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,320
yeah it is you know was it was really it

731
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,159
was a real bubble you know because it

732
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,038
wasn't like it was accepted people had a

733
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,360
lot of mis people would come here and

734
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,119
think that it was like weed was legal

735
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,519
and everybody liked it and everyone got

736
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,199
along and this and that and it was it

737
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,359
was still really underground it was

738
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,159
still cat and mouse with the cops

739
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,759
um the era that that gene is talking

740
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,880
about when his friends were starting to

741
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,319
grow weed nobody grew weed real like

742
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,640
i don't want to say nobody but for the

743
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,879
most part you grew weed in the woods

744
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,400
you grew weed in the manzanitas you you

745
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,520
didn't grow weed like right out your

746
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,759
back door

747
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,440
um you know you put some distance most

748
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,038
people most people would try to put some

749
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,640
distance between their house and where

750
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,158
they had their patch

751
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,038
because they didn't want to get raided

752
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,720
you know

753
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,599
and like he was saying carrying buckets

754
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,839
of water figuring out how to run water

755
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,038
from point a to point b even to get your

756
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,798
plants fed

757
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,480
um and you know back then

758
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,200
you know i don't know what prices he was

759
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,558
getting but weed was like 4 500 or 5 000

760
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,919
or more a pound

761
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:42,319
so you got away with 20 25 pounds of

762
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,120
shade grown manzanita weed

763
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,798
and you had a phenomenal year

764
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,038
yeah you know the scale of everything

765
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,960
was different in the sense that like you

766
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,720
didn't have to grow like some enormous

767
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,519
thing like you know you didn't have to

768
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,360
grow hundreds of pounds to make a living

769
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,558
you know if you got away with 20 or 30

770
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,639
you were set

771
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,000
you know and then the trim scene and all

772
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,159
that other stuff really wasn't that big

773
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,519
of a deal so everyone was kind of just

774
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,799
learning

775
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,879
and like the

776
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,480
like like train wrecks salmon creek big

777
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,799
bud the effects like you mentioned there

778
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,159
was some name things but there was still

779
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,599
a lot

780
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
i don't want to say until the purple

781
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,678
craze when when people started demanding

782
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,759
uniform pounds

783
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,759
because like with outdoor at least from

784
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,839
my experience up here

785
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,480
like people would grow the same strains

786
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,558
but they would mix pounds and mix phenos

787
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,960
yeah right so you'd get three four five

788
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,079
phenoes in a pound a lot of the time

789
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
you know and that was perfectly

790
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,678
acceptable

791
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,440
yeah to do that like so you'd have you'd

792
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,720
have weed from the instead of the weed

793
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,720
having a name

794
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,519
it would be like from whatever town or

795
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,278
area like oh this is some white thorn

796
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,319
this is some panther gap

797
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,398
this is from my buddies out on spy rock

798
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,720
you know and you know he mentioned that

799
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,158
too spy rock and spyroc and bell springs

800
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,399
are pretty famous

801
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,760
weed growing communities mostly because

802
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,239
they're mountainous and they're way out

803
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,398
in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere and so

804
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,359
they're remote they're hard to get to

805
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:10,000
so cannabis really wasn't like like

806
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,759
like permitted out here it was more like

807
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,679
a kind of a cat and mouse game and there

808
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,960
was a few enough people that you could

809
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,360
get away with it

810
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,038
um you know if you were careful

811
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,158
but everyone we know got camped

812
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:21,839
sometimes

813
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
i mean there used to be an old joke that

814
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,199
you would like you would plant three

815
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,240
gardens and one was for you and one was

816
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,840
the cops and one was for the thieves

817
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,798
and you hoped that one of them came

818
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,918
through

819
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,200
in a way

820
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,360
you know because you could go like the

821
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,679
same thing you could st you could go

822
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,000
you know on on you know harvest moon or

823
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,360
whatever with full moons during fall you

824
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,119
know you could get people out there that

825
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,319
could go with some contractor bags and

826
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,398
they could steal 10 or 15 or 20 pounds

827
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,798
and back then that was that was a ton of

828
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:53,359
money yeah so you could go and check on

829
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,960
your crop and it's gone

830
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,319
the whole thing is gone

831
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,640
trauma

832
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,278
you know yeah and at that point even

833
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,880
when the when the clones started taking

834
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:03,759
off and it was like everybody wanted to

835
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
grow

836
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,200
train wreck it wasn't because oh if i

837
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,359
have train wreck i'm gonna get a higher

838
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,840
price or people will want my weed faster

839
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,759
you could sell any weed you had it just

840
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,839
had to be dried right and it had to be

841
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,480
mature and it had to be trimmed good you

842
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,480
know yeah

843
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,440
it was only the only reason people were

844
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,679
growing clones then was reliability so

845
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,840
if you would grow a train wreck you knew

846
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,240
you were gonna get a good crop with a

847
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,879
lot of weed and you liked how it how it

848
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,919
was to cut down and how it was to trim

849
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
and then

850
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,399
you know it was reliable like you know

851
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,960
you're gonna get something good out of

852
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,639
this so you grow the clone and and then

853
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,240
also somebody tries this clone it

854
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,480
doesn't work well for them in their

855
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,079
garden or the way they grow and they try

856
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,480
this other clone and it works really

857
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,240
good for them so they're like okay so

858
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,440
then that's why people got stuck with

859
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,319
the clones

860
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,480
the first clone that carried a premium

861
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,278
in this area was urkel and urkel was the

862
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,240
one

863
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,839
that totally shot everything to [ __ ] as

864
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,798
far as the

865
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,879
the um the diversity because before that

866
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,480
somebody was like oh i like this clone

867
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,559
and somebody was like oh i like that

868
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,720
clone and urkel came and it was like

869
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,519
well that's cool but this urkel you can

870
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,399
sell right now for like 48 a pound half

871
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,960
wet

872
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,558
so you're selling 12 ounce pounds and

873
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,000
you're like it might look good if you

874
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,158
don't know how to grow it yet and you

875
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
think it's done at seven weeks and it's

876
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,039
really not

877
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,640
but it didn't matter as long as you

878
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,240
could get it to go

879
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,240
at first it didn't even really matter if

880
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,558
it went purple but it after just a

881
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,278
little couple runs worth of time going

882
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,839
by

883
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,359
if you could get it to get dark

884
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,798
people would show up and they'd and

885
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,398
you'd be like it's still wet and they'd

886
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,200
be like well let me see it and you'd be

887
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,558
like well can they do no just take that

888
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,720
put it in the bag they're like we'll

889
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,440
take it down south and we'll dry it in

890
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,120
our bedroom dude and we don't

891
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,120
that it's not going to be a pound when

892
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,719
it gets done because people were so

893
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,719
hungry for it

894
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,759
and uh that's super accurate because

895
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,240
before urkel before the purple wave and

896
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,960
probably 0.30405

897
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,399
was kind of that was kind of that wave

898
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,319
he's right every good type of weed sold

899
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,079
if it was grown decently well and it was

900
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,278
dried it was dried well and it was

901
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,038
trimmed well

902
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,720
people would just there wasn't a name

903
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,839
strain game people weren't coming up

904
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,120
here with like okay you need to buy x

905
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,558
amount of peas and it could be these

906
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,158
four strains

907
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,519
it was like go get some good weed and

908
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
bring it back

909
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,839
yeah you know

910
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,960
and it's seedless and it's trimmed

911
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,798
and the the day it's ready

912
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,759
you know it's it's all a matter of if

913
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:41,759
somebody

914
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,519
of scheduling it had nothing to do with

915
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,278
whether or not you could find a buyer

916
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,519
you have the right product or any of

917
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,278
that stuff it was like there's weed okay

918
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,440
it's gone and then

919
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:54,079
everything would be you know back then

920
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,038
it was there was only one big wave of

921
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:59,678
harvest the outdoor not the debt

922
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,519
and so it wasn't this constant thing of

923
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,240
there always being weeds so it would be

924
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,240
like there would be a bunch of weed

925
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,960
never a flood and then it would be all

926
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,679
drought for most of the year and i

927
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,798
remember being like okay it's august

928
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,880
or july or september and like like for

929
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,759
reggae on the river we used to save our

930
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,559
best

931
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,879
uh

932
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,000
you know og foundation got me doing that

933
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,399
because he'd be like oh this is my

934
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,079
reggae stash i'd be like oh [ __ ] i

935
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,319
better save a reggae stash too so you'd

936
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,759
have like some buds that you came across

937
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,038
through the year that were like the best

938
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,720
weed and you'd be like oh i'm gonna take

939
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,158
two grams of this and set it aside or

940
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,319
i'm gonna take five grams of this and

941
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,399
set it aside and then if you could show

942
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,879
up a reggae on the river the first

943
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,599
weekend in august and have a sack of

944
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,440
weed like this it was just like epic

945
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,558
because people were like

946
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,558
[ __ ] how do you have that you know

947
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,440
stash some people would still have weed

948
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,599
and people who were either had

949
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,640
the good fortune to have a ton of weed

950
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,278
or

951
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
who like had certain um either

952
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,440
connections or lack of connections where

953
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,278
they just wound up with wheat in august

954
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,720
like you would have weed but it was a

955
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,278
big deal

956
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,360
in the summer months to have weed back

957
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,880
then yeah and this is no this is before

958
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,719
cell phones too

959
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,440
it's before the internet or any kind of

960
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,240
forums so for a bunch of people in

961
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,240
humble so in southern humble and mendo

962
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,359
like wrecking on the river was not only

963
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,120
like a

964
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,519
it was two days back then but it wasn't

965
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,359
just like a big weekend of fun you could

966
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,480
actually meet someone

967
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,240
where like they wanted wheat

968
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,759
right where like everyone you knew grew

969
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,359
weed for the most part if you were in

970
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,519
those little circles and so a lot of

971
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,599
people made a bunch of connections to

972
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
other parts of the state or wherever

973
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,079
wherever you know because they would

974
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,519
bump into people and like like he was

975
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,720
just saying like you know they'd smoke

976
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,558
some weed and they'd be like oh my god

977
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,519
this is amazing can you get me more of

978
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,119
this

979
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,359
let me give you my number and you can

980
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,038
call me after this event and like let me

981
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,319
try to come up and get a few pounds let

982
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,240
me try to get this let me try to get

983
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,759
that because it was like there was so

984
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,640
much demand there was a little bit of

985
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:07,278
indoor going on for sure but not

986
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,000
nothing in comparison to demand

987
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,320
and when outdoor came in i wouldn't even

988
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,760
say it was a flood there was just more

989
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
weed

990
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,800
yeah it would never flood it would never

991
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,399
was just

992
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,639
and then it was unavailable and that was

993
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,559
like the two you can get it

994
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,079
if you had good weed for years and years

995
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,679
if you had good weed you could probably

996
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,639
sell it within three to five days of it

997
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,960
hitting the bag without too much effort

998
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,720
and it didn't really matter what it was

999
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,280
um it mattered if it was nice or not but

1000
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,199
it but the name game the specifics of it

1001
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,200
like i said you could get you could sell

1002
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,439
somebody 10 pounds it was a mix of eight

1003
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,319
different phenos

1004
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,398
and if it was good it would go fine

1005
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,800
yeah you know if it was good

1006
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,799
you were good

1007
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,959
all the stuff they look for now

1008
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,879
no that that didn't really matter

1009
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,159
um and so as a result of that there was

1010
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,400
like a bunch of diversity

1011
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,799
because there was a lot of hill people

1012
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,039
that had their random strains that

1013
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,800
they'd grown for a long time or their

1014
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,639
friends had given them you know not

1015
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
everybody bred but

1016
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,879
uh you know gene and i have talked about

1017
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,639
this before kind of one of the most

1018
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,960
common ways people would breed because

1019
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,559
they grew from seed every year is every

1020
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,039
two or three or four years they'd be

1021
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,119
like oh i should make some fresh seed

1022
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,960
and they'd take all their sexed males

1023
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,880
that they vegeta pots before they

1024
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
planted in their holes and they'd put

1025
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,480
those sex males like on some other part

1026
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,838
of the hill

1027
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,280
away downwind you know and then they'd

1028
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,599
have their females growing in their

1029
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,320
patch and a lot of times they would go

1030
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,079
and collect male collect male pollen and

1031
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,079
then bring it back and like

1032
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,720
brush it on their favorite females

1033
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,359
bottom branches from that year

1034
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,959
and mark them

1035
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,639
and then you know when they harvested

1036
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,320
you know they'd get x amount of hundreds

1037
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,920
or you know whatever seeds and that was

1038
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,160
their next two three years worth of

1039
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,280
supply

1040
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,719
until they were like oh these are

1041
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
getting kind of old i'm running a little

1042
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,279
low i should do that again this year

1043
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,519
which if you do the math you realize

1044
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,960
that those those things that are the

1045
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,358
modern weed

1046
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,920
like the most modern weed like it's the

1047
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:21,119
new it's cookies or it's whatever it is

1048
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,838
you go yeah it's probably only really

1049
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,200
in a lot of cases was only a handful of

1050
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,199
generations

1051
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,439
displaced from origin

1052
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,000
you know like a lot of afghanis they're

1053
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,760
not actually 30 generations after

1054
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,358
afghanistan a lot of them might only be

1055
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,040
three or four generations later because

1056
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,719
someone's like oh [ __ ] my seed's seven

1057
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,079
years old you're like well the ship

1058
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,399
should in 81 it showed up in 85

1059
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,119
so then you go well when i was seeing it

1060
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,960
it was 94 95 96. like [ __ ] somebody only

1061
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,760
made seed twice since it showed up from

1062
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,440
afghanistan or three or four times like

1063
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,240
there wasn't even that much improvement

1064
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,639
which

1065
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,399
uh was what i was what i was gonna say

1066
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,118
too about like all the weed back then

1067
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,880
you go oh it didn't have to be special

1068
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,880
it was like it didn't have to be special

1069
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,519
but if you saw the weed now that was in

1070
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,280
those bags that only had to be dried

1071
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,519
good and only had to be mature and

1072
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,839
seedless you'd look at it and you go

1073
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,800
what is this one yeah what is that

1074
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,199
it wasn't like the weed was undeveloped

1075
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,039
in in a genetic sense or it was

1076
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,679
unrefined in a breeding sense it was

1077
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,960
like no [ __ ] was bomb and and we

1078
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,879
actually

1079
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,039
what we have now that's our very best

1080
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,680
stuff is kind of the remnants of what

1081
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,759
was then kind of just normal

1082
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,118
weed you know like because a lot of this

1083
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,520
stuff that was

1084
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,440
uh in the hills in california was like

1085
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,920
really [ __ ] good and everything that

1086
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,838
amsterdam got was just them going oh

1087
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
whoa they have crazy [ __ ] in oakland

1088
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,159
they have crazy [ __ ] and humble they

1089
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,078
have crazy [ __ ] in santa cruz and then

1090
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,440
all that stuff they took it over there

1091
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,200
and then didn't even really have

1092
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,599
experience with it

1093
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,519
and and tried to do some stuff and some

1094
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,000
people hit and some people missed and

1095
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,920
then people wound up going oh

1096
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,159
this modern weed it that's so high in

1097
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,400
thc it's so heavy yielding and you're

1098
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,118
like no the ship that i saw that was

1099
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,440
bred twice after afghanistan was already

1100
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,000
like what people now look at and go oh

1101
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,920
it's holy [ __ ] it's space weed it's like

1102
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,559
yeah that was what that was what you

1103
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,400
know like that was what came over

1104
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,880
there's not genetics don't work in a way

1105
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,200
where traits just miraculously appear

1106
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,119
although they do it's very rare and a

1107
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,399
lot of that really good [ __ ] it was it

1108
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,079
was already

1109
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,440
it was already there in what we were

1110
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,359
seeing at reggae on the river and

1111
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,880
somebody sat from santa cruz that showed

1112
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,319
up to sell their pound or whatever you

1113
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,640
know like stuff was

1114
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,119
stuff was crazy i think probably when it

1115
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,199
showed up you know and i i would add to

1116
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,480
that that uh i was smiling when he said

1117
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,239
that because

1118
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,320
one of the one of you know when you

1119
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,239
apply capitalism to all this stuff right

1120
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,119
a lot of the modern breeding

1121
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,118
is when you know you get some stuff and

1122
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,800
it's amazing and you're like okay well i

1123
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,400
spent a lot of time and a lot of effort

1124
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,599
and this is a result of me being really

1125
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,358
smart

1126
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,880
when we all know it's like it's a lot of

1127
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,279
accidents and you're already starting

1128
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,240
with good working material to begin with

1129
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,000
you know

1130
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,319
a lot

1131
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,199
yeah i mean

1132
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,920
whole traits out of thin air you can

1133
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,078
like if you want way more resin there is

1134
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,760
ways to go okay i'm gonna take a plant

1135
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,240
that gets way more trichomes per square

1136
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,079
centimeter and i'm gonna take this one

1137
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,639
that gets huge heads but it doesn't have

1138
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,000
very many combine them and wind up with

1139
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,920
the best of both worlds and have

1140
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,838
something that has way more resin with

1141
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,880
way bigger heads and your numbers shoot

1142
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,679
way up

1143
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,000
but you still have to have those two

1144
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,358
traits have to be there and separately

1145
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
they were still pretty [ __ ] good

1146
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,719
because you already had one with a whole

1147
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,119
shitload of resin but the heads weren't

1148
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,039
huge and you had one with huge [ __ ]

1149
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,760
heads so both of them were already

1150
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,440
pretty good [ __ ] weed right so like

1151
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,119
and in a lot of cases when we find

1152
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,679
something that's like that you're really

1153
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,079
just finding that plant that already had

1154
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,159
the combination in the first place and

1155
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,680
you you might think you made it through

1156
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,118
combination but really if you would have

1157
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,879
grown 200 girls of one side you'd go oh

1158
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,640
it was already in there and then i

1159
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,318
thought i made it and you didn't [ __ ]

1160
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,199
make it you just found it you know so

1161
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,159
it's like

1162
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:20,318
really with all that it's really like um

1163
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,078
you're really kind of more discovering

1164
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,920
than you are creating you're trying to

1165
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,318
find some good [ __ ] it's like you're not

1166
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,079
you're not making the gold you're just

1167
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,719
[ __ ] digging through some [ __ ] to

1168
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,240
pull out some nuggets you know yeah

1169
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,279
that's for sure

1170
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:37,759
and i think to some degree that's why

1171
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,400
the 90s kind of remains like a lot of

1172
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,560
the backbone of modern breeding

1173
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,119
was because of all that diversity

1174
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,078
because it was before the name game book

1175
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,680
because

1176
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,000
you know like the last 10 years of

1177
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,598
reading not everyone there's obviously

1178
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
outliers and people that do different

1179
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,760
stuff but like in most modern breeding

1180
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,280
it's like take all the most popular

1181
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,960
things i can find and blend them

1182
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,000
together and hopefully i get a little

1183
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,639
version that people have some clout with

1184
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,960
right where you know weed in the 90s was

1185
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,639
back could be vastly different because

1186
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,000
there wasn't pressure on it for it to be

1187
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,838
the same

1188
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,800
it just had just good it just had to be

1189
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:14,639
good

1190
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,720
and the other thing is it didn't even

1191
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,879
have to be pretty

1192
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:22,239
it just had to be good and by good it's

1193
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,559
like if it got you high huh

1194
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,000
your life smoked dude yeah your body i

1195
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,480
don't know

1196
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,639
back in the day people who bought weed

1197
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,880
when they showed up they smoked the [ __ ]

1198
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,039
can you imagine look at that you you

1199
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
could not sell weed without them smoking

1200
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,599
a few joints with you and making sure it

1201
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,039
burned right making sure it wasn't harsh

1202
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,760
making sure their customers weren't

1203
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,358
going to be pissed off so a lot of times

1204
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,800
you could go at some weed and they could

1205
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:47,838
be like oh this is a suspect i don't

1206
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
know about this weed and you're like

1207
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,199
well let's roll some joints and hang out

1208
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,159
for a second and then if it was good

1209
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,039
weed

1210
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,078
they i mean in modern times it's like

1211
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,119
name

1212
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,359
look

1213
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,720
does it have any larf does it have nose

1214
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,719
what's your price point okay

1215
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,240
and like [ __ ]

1216
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,679
shitty buyers have you guys had to hang

1217
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,479
out with for like two hours watching a

1218
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,960
movie just to do a transaction that [ __ ]

1219
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,599
sucks i mean it depends you know it's

1220
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,199
it's like it it uh you know there was a

1221
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,640
whole industry of it up here there was a

1222
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,559
lot of people that didn't like to do

1223
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,920
that and so the people that were even

1224
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,960
the people that were willing to go to

1225
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,960
the bay

1226
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,039
right like i remember

1227
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,960
um you know going out spy rock and you

1228
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,679
could go talk to people up there

1229
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,358
um that like you know that they had

1230
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,480
indoor they had big underground indoors

1231
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,559
and stuff like that and you could get

1232
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,639
weed for like 36

1233
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,078
which was dirt cheap and i used to tell

1234
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,480
them that i would like take it to the

1235
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,920
bay and i would get way more for it

1236
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,358
and they'd be like but you have to do

1237
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,079
that

1238
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,159
if you come to my driveway and we and i

1239
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,519
can be at my house and you give me this

1240
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,960
i'm happy

1241
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,119
yeah

1242
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,800
as a 22 year old 23 year old kid i was

1243
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,480
like that's so dumb you know and i'd go

1244
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
to the city and i'd make my margin and i

1245
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,400
party and i have a great time and then i

1246
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,079
hit my 30s or 40s or whatever and i'm

1247
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,318
like oh man that makes perfect sense if

1248
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,839
you can just come to my door

1249
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,119
and be fair

1250
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,639
and then go away i'm cool because like i

1251
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,160
got dinner to cook and i got some kids

1252
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,960
to take care of and i don't want to go

1253
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,960
all the way down to the [ __ ] day

1254
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,440
you know and then the fair away and it's

1255
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,119
still 50 and 8 for most people you know

1256
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,400
yeah it's still

1257
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,640
three prices when when when pounds were

1258
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,920
about to hit basically six grand

1259
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,318
wholesale

1260
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,480
and the it was like whoa eights are

1261
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,559
worth [ __ ] 50 and 60 dollars that's

1262
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,880
[ __ ] crazy but at least pounds are

1263
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,400
worth 6 grand to the farmer

1264
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,000
yeah and now

1265
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,880
you still pay now people are selling

1266
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,639
hundred dollar eights yeah ten people

1267
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,800
i don't know you know this shit's really

1268
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,078
not worth any money you know

1269
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,000
that's crazy

1270
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,000
that's where i have friends that joke

1271
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,039
with me right now that they can go into

1272
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,800
a dispensary and they can go buy a 600

1273
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,679
ounce

1274
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,000
that's

1275
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,480
or they could go buy a pound that's

1276
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,960
probably better for cheaper

1277
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,159
yeah

1278
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,280
yeah i saw 600 an ounce weed and it was

1279
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,199
[ __ ] hilarious yeah i was like

1280
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
i mean i understand maybe that there

1281
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,399
could be something that would be worth

1282
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,640
that if it was like

1283
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,760
really hard to grow and it [ __ ] took

1284
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,838
24 weeks and you've never tried anything

1285
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,240
like this but it's like it's just some

1286
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,759
bud that people used to sell for really

1287
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,078
cheap and it's not even as good of a

1288
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,440
version and it's like selling for 600 an

1289
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,920
ounce and you're like [ __ ] okay i mean

1290
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,318
the sad part is is that you would think

1291
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,639
with legalization typically it makes

1292
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,400
quality go up and price go down

1293
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,440
because you take the risk out of the

1294
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
equation

1295
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,318
you know and there's there's a risk

1296
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,599
pricing in there but so far with

1297
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,039
cannabis the way we've structured

1298
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,160
california it's kind of done the

1299
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,400
opposite

1300
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,719
weed in general is way worse than the

1301
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,160
215 era and it's definitely more

1302
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,598
expensive

1303
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,239
yeah it'd be different if you were

1304
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,480
producing a molecule right like you're

1305
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,959
producing a molecule so like at scale it

1306
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,119
doesn't really matter you get rid of all

1307
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,159
barriers and obstacles and [ __ ] and then

1308
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,240
all of a sudden you're going to be like

1309
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,639
dude we're producing this molecule like

1310
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,118
[ __ ] crazy and it's it's not illegal

1311
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,039
anymore so yeah we dropped the price

1312
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,200
still producing it and then but with

1313
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,519
wheat it's like weed doesn't scale very

1314
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,719
well i mean we

1315
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,759
we've

1316
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:32,000
so hard to scale that even when you go

1317
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,480
from seeing somebody who grows like like

1318
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,318
the best weed that i've ever seen almost

1319
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,639
every time comes from people who have

1320
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,400
like less than like a dozen lights if

1321
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,598
they're growing indoors

1322
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,000
and

1323
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,760
yeah the one light is we used to have a

1324
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,199
we used to have a bunch of friend mutual

1325
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,040
friends that would

1326
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:50,960
you know they would work for older cats

1327
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,920
and they would run these 1500 lighters

1328
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,760
right

1329
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,400
but they would come get their head stash

1330
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,319
off me because i had a 10 lighter

1331
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,440
and we used to joke that like you just

1332
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:00,960
couldn't get

1333
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,318
off that hundred light you couldn't get

1334
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,838
as good a weed

1335
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,000
you couldn't give it as much attention

1336
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,440
you couldn't whatever it was it was just

1337
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,880
like the little

1338
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,960
minor fi and that's kind of what

1339
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,519
happened is like people used to be able

1340
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,240
to make a really good living off 20 30

1341
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,759
40 100 a couple hundred pounds

1342
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,598
and then you could treat that stuff

1343
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,240
right you could dry it right you could

1344
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,838
cure it right you weren't overwhelmed

1345
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,598
you could have just a few people helping

1346
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,920
you and you could do the little things

1347
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,480
that kept it nice and now they're like

1348
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,559
how do i grow these 10 licenses i have

1349
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,440
and i've got 2 000 pounds coming down

1350
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,199
and

1351
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,079
costs are through the roof and i have to

1352
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,639
do osha and all this other [ __ ] and what

1353
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,240
suffers is the weak

1354
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,879
you know they start looking around at

1355
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,719
like what ways they can cut corners

1356
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,480
and you know it's they're not evil

1357
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,159
necessarily by any means they're just

1358
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,358
trying to survive because shit's all

1359
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,679
rough

1360
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,920
and or or they just don't they've grown

1361
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,440
100 or 200 pounds their whole career and

1362
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,920
that's been happy for them and then they

1363
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,880
get asked to grow 2 000 pounds

1364
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,960
and they just don't know how to scale up

1365
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,640
you know what because their system that

1366
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,240
they had for them when it was smaller

1367
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,719
worked amazing

1368
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,479
but their system didn't scale so you try

1369
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,639
to scale it up

1370
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
it's like cooking

1371
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,078
you you like oh i'm just gonna double

1372
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,440
the recipe

1373
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,200
it doesn't really work like that you

1374
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,358
can't just double recipes you know you

1375
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,000
like you sometimes you have to do it in

1376
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,159
batches so if you can have somebody

1377
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,318
and say okay you're going to do you're

1378
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,920
going to do like this many runs and

1379
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,599
maybe you're going to get more runs in

1380
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,159
or something then people can keep it

1381
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,400
exactly the same and then everybody has

1382
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,239
a ceiling so some people can scale a lot

1383
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,838
better than others because of the the

1384
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,759
way that they do things

1385
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,759
like as simple as i grow i probably

1386
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,079
could have scaled pretty well because i

1387
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,240
don't do anything very special and

1388
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,079
that's part of why i'm able to get weed

1389
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,118
that i really like because i just kind

1390
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,000
of let it

1391
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,240
do its thing so it's mostly the soil

1392
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,239
and then i really try to make sure to

1393
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,799
really like pay a lot of attention to

1394
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,598
harvesting and and drying it

1395
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,839
and uh so like it's it's doable but it's

1396
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,559
still i could still never do enough to

1397
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,639
be a big brand you know i just couldn't

1398
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,839
do it let's let's let's be clear too

1399
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,920
right so

1400
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,920
um i mean i came out here when i was in

1401
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,318
my early 20s so i didn't grow up here

1402
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,159
like he did but my experience is most

1403
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,599
weed growers back then were back to the

1404
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:24,799
landers

1405
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,039
hippies

1406
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,680
uh people that decided to grow weed

1407
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:32,000
because logging ended and they needed a

1408
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,679
way to support their family

1409
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,039
you know

1410
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,279
these aren't people that are like

1411
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,639
amazing at logistics

1412
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,240
you know these aren't like like

1413
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,679
sergeants that are like okay you three

1414
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,039
do this and this is the efficient way to

1415
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,719
do that and this and that and everything

1416
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,159
else they just figured out some kind of

1417
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,118
way that worked for them it's at a

1418
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,879
smaller medium scale and then you try to

1419
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,960
like commercialize that and all of a

1420
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,800
sudden their experience is only so good

1421
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,880
at that part because

1422
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,720
now it becomes logistics

1423
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,160
now it becomes like you know like now

1424
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,399
you're a conductor now you're trying to

1425
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,879
like move the orchestra around and like

1426
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,240
you're used to kind of just winging it

1427
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
you know and even

1428
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,159
when stuff becomes really super

1429
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,200
competitive in that kind of a that kind

1430
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,960
of a thing

1431
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,799
a lot of the people it's like back when

1432
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,720
weed was rare if we got weed and it

1433
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,800
didn't suck and it was good genetics you

1434
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,719
were like wow this is really good weed

1435
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,559
but then when things get more and more

1436
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:25,199
competitive a lot of the people too who

1437
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,599
you're like oh they have killer weed and

1438
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:30,399
like it's it's like you're like well but

1439
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,280
is it like is it really that killer but

1440
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,800
it has to go up against people who are

1441
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,160
so knowledgeable

1442
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,400
and are going okay well you know this

1443
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,960
you gotta have this particular watering

1444
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,358
schedule and this dry back and all these

1445
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
different like very specific parameters

1446
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,799
and then it's like

1447
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,280
it's like yeah their weed was really

1448
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,720
good but it's not it's still not

1449
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,640
competitive and i'm not saying that's

1450
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,399
everybody but that's a whole section of

1451
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,719
people too where all of a sudden now

1452
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,440
when there's a huge flood you're like

1453
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,519
well this weed is just not like there's

1454
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,838
always been people who who

1455
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,599
would would be like oh dude i have this

1456
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,000
weed and i i'd look at it and i'd be

1457
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,680
like oh cool it's nice you know but at

1458
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,199
the same time i'm like it's not

1459
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,279
competitive though

1460
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,279
you know and it's something that i can't

1461
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,880
i like can't bring myself

1462
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,200
to tell people that

1463
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,079
i just am like yeah it's it's good you

1464
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,759
know but like you could you you kind of

1465
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,200
you just kind of look at the reality and

1466
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,319
you go [ __ ] have you seen what people

1467
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,598
are doing

1468
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:33,358
like people's [ __ ] is crazy

1469
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,599
and we some of us have always been able

1470
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,598
to do it like like i was saying like

1471
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,680
people i know ladies who had one light

1472
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,318
or two lights and every time they would

1473
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,239
have weeds you'd just be like holy [ __ ]

1474
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,558
and to this day people doing all the

1475
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:49,039
most scientific tricks they can't they

1476
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,640
can't do any better than these ladies

1477
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,318
with their two lighters or their four

1478
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:55,838
lighters or their one lighters still the

1479
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:58,318
best weed ever but

1480
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,960
that was never everybody and there was a

1481
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:01,838
point when if you had weed you were like

1482
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,280
yeah

1483
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,799
and this is the funny thing like with

1484
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,559
with especially with old school growers

1485
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,039
and growers in general everybody always

1486
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,200
thinks their weed is the best like i've

1487
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,719
never met i've only met probably a

1488
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,279
couple people who can look at wheat

1489
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,838
objectively and go oh it's good because

1490
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,280
of this but i missed here and i missed

1491
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,920
there and this would have been a little

1492
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,720
better like this and and to really be

1493
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,039
objective and like and and and logically

1494
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,679
look at stuff it's generally like this

1495
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,679
is mine and it's the best you know yeah

1496
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,919
and so that's really i think been

1497
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:36,960
something too that is a big

1498
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,760
barrier for people to get past

1499
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,599
um

1500
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,680
to be able to look at stuff and go well

1501
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,599
[ __ ] maybe i need to

1502
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,598
maybe i need to figure out i need to ask

1503
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,640
people more questions i need to be able

1504
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,480
to look at this and be able to and be

1505
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,639
able to like tell the difference between

1506
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,639
what this one is and what that one is

1507
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,118
and how do i make mine look like that

1508
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:59,118
one because mine looks like this one and

1509
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,280
that's like you know that's an important

1510
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,559
part of really doing any kind of process

1511
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,040
to really break it down it's like you go

1512
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,640
to a restaurant and

1513
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,480
they're not really doing very good

1514
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:11,118
business and you're like dude people

1515
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,800
want food especially like here you know

1516
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,200
and i've seen like all these places like

1517
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,039
pizza places or whatever it is and

1518
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,279
they're like i don't know you know we

1519
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,960
make great pizza and nobody's buying it

1520
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,960
and i'm like guess what people [ __ ]

1521
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,559
buy great pizza like

1522
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,280
you don't have to twist people's arm to

1523
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,519
buy a [ __ ] pizza they want the pizza

1524
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,559
they just don't want your pizza and the

1525
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,719
only

1526
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,400
your pizza be the pizza people want is

1527
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,118
to like ask somebody like dude how do

1528
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,240
you can i maybe like get the starter for

1529
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,240
the dough

1530
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,719
and then like how do you do your dough

1531
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:44,639
and what temperature is your oven and

1532
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,118
what is in your sauce can i get the

1533
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,039
recipe for your sauce and you know like

1534
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,800
those little things and what's i made it

1535
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,318
like this what happened what went wrong

1536
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,720
and then all of a sudden like in this

1537
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,519
area and not so knows this if you had

1538
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,598
good [ __ ] pizza in where i live

1539
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,519
you would stay in business for [ __ ]

1540
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,519
ever and you would make it

1541
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,440
right oh yeah but

1542
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,599
there's been every pizza place has come

1543
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,000
and gone and some of them are good here

1544
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,440
and there and like it's like okay you go

1545
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
there and you go oh this is great and

1546
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,400
it's inconsistent and this is just an

1547
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,639
analogy to to what's up with weed too

1548
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,760
you know like you really have to [ __ ]

1549
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,000
um

1550
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,559
constantly try to figure out what it is

1551
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,400
now if you were one of the people

1552
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,240
who just happened to [ __ ] make some

1553
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,720
[ __ ] and it came out really good and

1554
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:33,679
everybody loves it then [ __ ] go with

1555
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,199
it if the recipe works it works but if

1556
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,919
it's not working you got to know when to

1557
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,919
look at it and be like [ __ ] what what do

1558
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,720
i need to do you like you you have you

1559
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,318
ever watched like what's that bar rescue

1560
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,439
or those shows

1561
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,599
you know what i mean like the gordon

1562
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,119
ramsay he comes in he's like no dude

1563
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,480
we're going to make a [ __ ] bruschetta

1564
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,318
and it's going to be bread and you're

1565
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,079
going to put tomatoes on it and balsamic

1566
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,039
vinegar and some [ __ ] basil you guys

1567
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,599
are making this [ __ ] crazy concoction

1568
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,519
and nobody likes it and you look at it

1569
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,200
[ __ ] simple just stop doing all this

1570
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,119
weird [ __ ] and it's the same with the

1571
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,838
with weed and the weed market you know

1572
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,559
it's just it's it's a weird it's a weird

1573
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:13,199
thing and then there's so much

1574
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,839
that is done on that level and so little

1575
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:19,118
that's done on the really crazy level

1576
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,880
that you know it's it's like

1577
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,960
i'm convinced if you're really still on

1578
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,800
that level that people still want your

1579
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,800
weed but if you're just a little bit

1580
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,960
below it it's like what the [ __ ]

1581
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,200
what are you going to do

1582
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,800
networking too is tough yeah there's

1583
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,960
there's an aspect where

1584
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,559
people kind of went from

1585
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,358
like trying to grow the best weed they

1586
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,960
possibly could uh which

1587
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,159
never happened exclusively there was

1588
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,679
plent but you know there's a lot of

1589
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,239
people that like you know now they just

1590
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,838
try to grow like decent commercial

1591
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,439
you know they're trying to grow decent

1592
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,440
commercial at scale and like and the

1593
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,400
decent commercial is rough you know and

1594
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,159
so

1595
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,318
like the name strain game part of the

1596
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,078
reason why like you know the purple

1597
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:01,039
craze happened and then right after that

1598
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,160
the kush and the sour and and and cookie

1599
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,239
and all that

1600
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:06,960
um part of the reason why that exploded

1601
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:09,759
so much in our area was because people

1602
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,119
wanted to just give the broker what they

1603
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,520
wanted

1604
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,680
like if the broker was like all 58 of

1605
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,358
these look good i'll take them all

1606
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,039
you know and then they look at this

1607
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,960
other guy's stuff and he's got some nice

1608
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,719
stuff and they end up taking ten when he

1609
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,159
leaves the guy that had the variety

1610
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,239
looks at the dude that got cleared out

1611
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,000
and was like can i get that from you

1612
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,598
what is that i want to get the thing

1613
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,798
that the dude is going to come and clear

1614
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,640
me out

1615
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:34,798
whatever that is i want it

1616
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:34,798
yeah

1617
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,519
that's the sourdough starter for your

1618
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,280
crust you know yeah that's like that one

1619
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,039
that's the [ __ ] sauce right there you

1620
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,519
know and that's what what's funny about

1621
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,400
urkel is that there was a time

1622
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,719
in which

1623
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,358
there was an endless demand for indoor

1624
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,519
urkel from our area right and basically

1625
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:57,679
like every big grower i knew

1626
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,400
ran indoors of urkel

1627
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,558
and then when the purple craze ended and

1628
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,880
it went on to sour and cush and these

1629
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,880
other things fast forward ten years and

1630
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,640
there was like six dudes that held onto

1631
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,680
urkel

1632
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:14,639
when we both knew dozens

1633
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:16,960
and dozens of people everyone had it

1634
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,358
that was reg that was what if you had

1635
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,400
weave like probably circle yeah or a

1636
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,318
very

1637
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,358
type of weed you know there was

1638
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:27,920
blue dragon and purple nepal and grape

1639
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:31,039
ape and it but it was like purple with a

1640
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,639
sweet fruit loopy you know

1641
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,318
it's also that i should we should

1642
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,000
mention too it's also that kind of thing

1643
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,679
where like that craze was one of the

1644
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,760
first times where

1645
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,598
people wanted to give their own name to

1646
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,119
something whether it was different or

1647
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,838
not or whether it was just a slight

1648
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,640
variation or a bag seat of whatever

1649
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:51,440
there had to be gdp and gr and grape ape

1650
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,400
and purple urkel and purple dragon and

1651
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,760
you know and platinum purple and

1652
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,519
you know and it was like this thing

1653
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,599
where it was like people it was like the

1654
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,759
start of people wanting to differentiate

1655
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,880
their little thing

1656
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,079
didn't matter because it's very

1657
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,760
different

1658
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,960
yeah because the name had worked you're

1659
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,280
like well

1660
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,920
[ __ ] people you say it's purple urkel

1661
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,440
like everybody everybody wants it you

1662
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,838
know the names were really working and

1663
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,760
it was the same like in la if you had

1664
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,400
some weed that was really good you just

1665
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,880
call it such and such kush

1666
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,200
and then to combine the two when the

1667
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,640
purple craze ended people were like oh

1668
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:30,318
people don't want this blackberry

1669
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:31,759
anymore i should call it blackberry kush

1670
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,519
because the cush name was

1671
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,280
this is the this is the purple kush this

1672
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,199
is the blackberry kush

1673
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,880
it's just like that cush you want but

1674
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,879
darker electric it was

1675
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,240
also a purple flow cut up here that

1676
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,640
finished in early september

1677
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,479
that was originally purple flow and this

1678
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,358
stuff must have been i don't know like

1679
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,039
five percent thc or something you

1680
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:58,798
couldn't get high off it it smelled

1681
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,199
really nice and sweet it smelled really

1682
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,199
similar to what the blackberry clone was

1683
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,838
but it turned way darker

1684
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:08,159
and it was done so early and fast and it

1685
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,679
got tons of these huge buds everywhere

1686
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,838
and everybody started calling that

1687
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,199
blackberry kush and online i've seen a

1688
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,440
lot of people

1689
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,679
call that one blackberry and i'm like no

1690
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,159
that was the purple flow it was purple

1691
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:21,679
flow for like maybe a year or two and

1692
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,358
then all of a sudden everybody went it

1693
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:25,679
kind of smells like that blackberry

1694
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:28,239
clone and the blackberry wasn't very

1695
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:31,199
stony but it wasn't as no stone as this

1696
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:33,679
[ __ ] flow clone this flow clone

1697
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,639
nothing it was like you could not hide

1698
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,798
off this [ __ ] yeah and uh and then after

1699
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:41,039
a while then that became the blackberry

1700
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:43,199
clone and i would ask people like so the

1701
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,679
one that didn't get you high at all this

1702
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,279
blackberry i'm like when did it finish

1703
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,279
because the other one was like early

1704
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,839
october it was still very fast and would

1705
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,040
want to autoflower but this one had thin

1706
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,400
leaves and it was very purple way more

1707
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,480
purple where the other one was very

1708
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,880
frosty and pretty almost like a bubba

1709
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,960
but with a little bigger features and it

1710
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,318
tasted really good didn't get you that

1711
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,519
high but people didn't give a [ __ ]

1712
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:07,679
because you smoked something else to get

1713
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,679
stoned but it tasted so good and then

1714
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,358
the other one came in and it got really

1715
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,199
big for like two seasons here and

1716
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:15,920
everyone grew it and then all of a

1717
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:18,879
sudden everybody was like you know what

1718
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,760
i'm literally like not getting any

1719
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,280
[ __ ] effects from this okay

1720
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,880
and there's and then

1721
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,240
he mentioned it before but there's an

1722
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,400
aspect we should probably talk about

1723
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:30,639
when when the name game happened

1724
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,440
in the beginning of any of these name

1725
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:35,440
games that occur if it has the name and

1726
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,440
it's and it's similar or the right cut

1727
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,920
it just all goes

1728
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,159
like if you know it just went right and

1729
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,720
then as more and more people get it the

1730
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:46,239
quality has to be nicer and so sometimes

1731
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:47,919
people would have a hard time getting

1732
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:49,279
like purples to turn purple in the

1733
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,680
middle of summer because their rooms

1734
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,359
would be too hot and it wasn't like you

1735
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,118
know people didn't have great like

1736
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,480
environmental controls back then or

1737
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,720
something like that and then you'd get

1738
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,880
some like green purple that was like

1739
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,798
harder to sell and so like that's kind

1740
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,640
of like what happens when like when a

1741
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:06,798
market starts to get saturated with a

1742
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,279
particular strain is like the best

1743
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,599
versions of it still go

1744
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,640
but it loses that like if it's it it

1745
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,798
goes

1746
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,118
because like early on if you had kush or

1747
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:19,838
you had sour you had purple or whatever

1748
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,838
and you had it it went

1749
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,920
and then as more and more people got it

1750
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:25,759
quality became more important and you

1751
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,559
actually had to have like really nice

1752
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,359
version of it for it to go as easily

1753
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,319
yeah

1754
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:31,679
you know

1755
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:33,679
um

1756
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,719
but you know that's kind of like

1757
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,118
that's

1758
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:39,118
there's an aspect to it where it's

1759
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,039
you know he's right in the sense where

1760
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,960
you know the name game happens and stuff

1761
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,318
gets stuff gets all mixed up but it

1762
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,000
really is

1763
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:47,679
like you know if you've been around for

1764
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,159
a long time you can see a lot of

1765
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,639
similarities in today's weed mashed

1766
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,159
together that's really old weed

1767
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,879
you know like we really actually haven't

1768
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:59,039
gone all that that far away from things

1769
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,559
i will agree with that we've mashed it

1770
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,159
up in various different ways and we've

1771
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,000
added all kinds of different names which

1772
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,838
just kind of obscures

1773
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,798
but we really haven't we really haven't

1774
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,400
like people think now weeds better than

1775
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,480
it's ever been

1776
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,160
and that's kind of probably just patting

1777
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,920
yourself on the back

1778
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,279
yeah you know weed's been really good

1779
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,200
for a long time

1780
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,280
it just mattered whether or not you had

1781
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:23,679
access to really good weed more people

1782
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,440
have access now than before

1783
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,118
but i don't know that weed's any better

1784
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,400
than it is before

1785
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,318
you know in fact it might have been

1786
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,760
better 20 years ago

1787
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:33,119
on average

1788
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,200
you know on average i would probably

1789
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,960
have to agree

1790
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:38,798
with what we have now

1791
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,400
yeah you know and then there's another

1792
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,679
thing too when it comes to names and

1793
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,440
stuff like that where it's like

1794
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,199
obviously we're in like the the

1795
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,880
marketing era where everything has to be

1796
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:51,118
candy or cake or or desserts or sugar or

1797
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,400
like evoke some kind of image

1798
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,480
um but you know back then it was like

1799
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,000
you know he mentioned it before but like

1800
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,838
you could get some weed that like gave

1801
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,559
you like brow sweat

1802
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:04,078
and you'd call it the sweat

1803
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,240
i'm not even saying that's it but that's

1804
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,240
like how a lot of names came about

1805
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:11,199
nobody would name it

1806
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:13,358
nobody would name anything sweat today

1807
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,960
nobody would name anything dog [ __ ]

1808
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:16,558
nobody name would name anything like

1809
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,000
there's a million names that would that

1810
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,039
would never work

1811
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,119
you know

1812
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,119
um i mean the mendo p that i found it

1813
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,960
you know i i didn't know exactly what it

1814
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,559
was so i just called it it was purple

1815
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,119
from mendo

1816
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,119
so it became mendo purple

1817
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,640
and at one point i was talking to my

1818
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,400
buddy who showed me some weed that was

1819
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,118
really balm and it was like

1820
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,280
it was kind of smelled to me like

1821
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,640
a mix between with like what i call the

1822
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:45,280
legget purp smell and the and like the

1823
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,879
the purple urkel smell in a sense

1824
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,480
and my buddy

1825
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,119
was like yeah i got this from this guy

1826
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,119
on belle springs he's he's the guy who

1827
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,920
because at one point people were saying

1828
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,798
oh

1829
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,039
urkel is just a plant from the mendo

1830
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,880
from the mendo perps right and i've

1831
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,760
never seen no perps

1832
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,200
and so uh my buddy showed me the buds

1833
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,960
and i was like damn this is bomb and it

1834
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,199
was some kind of balm afghani it was

1835
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,480
super good [ __ ] and this guy was like

1836
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:15,199
yeah i'm the i'm the guy who um that

1837
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,440
that the mendo perps came from

1838
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,838
and what's funny is i don't even think

1839
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,639
the guy was lying i think he heard about

1840
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,838
the mendo perps that was yours that got

1841
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,159
popular

1842
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:27,279
and that people were rumoring urkel came

1843
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:29,759
from

1844
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,240
and his weed he probably had called

1845
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,680
mendo perps because it's a pretty vague

1846
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:37,598
[ __ ] name right it's like black

1847
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:40,960
afghani very poor very vague yeah

1848
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:43,119
whatever it would or like big bud or you

1849
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,358
know what i mean snow bud like these

1850
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,200
things could easily be reused by

1851
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,119
somebody like um imagine now when you

1852
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,558
try to name strains and you google it

1853
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,920
people come up with the same [ __ ]

1854
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,839
idea for a lot of yeah it's really hard

1855
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,318
and i mean even it was even regional

1856
01:03:55,838 --> 01:04:00,480
right like like you just said snow bud

1857
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:02,639
like if you got snow bud from eugene it

1858
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,159
was the eugene snow

1859
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,000
if you got it in the humboldt it was the

1860
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,519
humboldt snow

1861
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,280
if you got it somewhere else in oregon

1862
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,358
it was called oregon snow and the

1863
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,280
humboldt guys and the eugene guys and

1864
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:14,960
the oregon guys all thought that theirs

1865
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,640
was the first one and everyone else got

1866
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,240
theirs later

1867
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,759
yeah because it's where they saw it

1868
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:22,078
first

1869
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,319
yeah you know and so i was talking to

1870
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,559
caleb at one point and i told him about

1871
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,558
that guy and i asked him like about like

1872
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,079
the perps what is it and i was just

1873
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,440
curious because he

1874
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,720
he seemed to have done a lot of work

1875
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,639
with all the different things and goes

1876
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:37,199
dude the mendo purpose is totally

1877
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,960
different than the urkel it's not even

1878
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,199
in the same ballpark

1879
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,440
and there's no way that there's any

1880
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:45,038
truth to that and i was like oh okay and

1881
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,639
it's the same as like when one of the

1882
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,799
first times i really bullshitted with

1883
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:50,719
them a lot of the show i was like yeah i

1884
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:53,280
go when i was in maui

1885
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:55,838
in the late 90s or the early right

1886
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,920
around 2000 somewhere in there there was

1887
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:00,159
this weed that my buddy lance used to

1888
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,559
always have that he called dog

1889
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,118
and he was always like this is the dog

1890
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,599
and i was always like

1891
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,440
damn this is some fire [ __ ] weed and

1892
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,519
i wasn't really familiar with any of

1893
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,000
like the cam and the diesel and all that

1894
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,838
[ __ ] came later for me because i wasn't

1895
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,519
seeing a lot of clones

1896
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:19,519
and i was seeing more like i said that

1897
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,199
lineup of the humble clones those more

1898
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,679
like commercial ones that were around

1899
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:25,519
and [ __ ] and so

1900
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:27,759
i remember talking to caleb and being

1901
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,440
like yeah i don't know like i might have

1902
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,440
because this is after i'd been reading

1903
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,798
[ __ ] online and stuff i was like it

1904
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,639
might be

1905
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:39,199
the it might be the um the original dog

1906
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:42,000
bud i'm not sure because these dudes

1907
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:44,078
were in oregon and they were in maui and

1908
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,838
they had it and then years later i was

1909
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,160
able to talk to my buddy gabe from over

1910
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,318
there and he goes no i know the dude

1911
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:53,519
who had that and he says that he found

1912
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:55,199
it in a bag of chem dog 91 and he found

1913
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,000
scene and he popped it and they called

1914
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,838
that the dog in maui and that was right

1915
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,760
around that time period and i was like

1916
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,920
all right well that makes sense but the

1917
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,839
names are so trippy because them just

1918
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,240
going oh we got it out of chem dog we're

1919
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,400
going to call it dog then you get that

1920
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,959
weed and then you hear the stories and

1921
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,599
you're like well so is it that and it's

1922
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,679
so easy to like think

1923
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,240
that that could be the real

1924
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:22,960
lineage and then be like well no because

1925
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:25,199
this information disproves it but that's

1926
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,760
why it's good to keep track of all of it

1927
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:30,159
to go okay and then it turns out [ __ ]

1928
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,400
that dog that's really good [ __ ] weed

1929
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,318
right it's a really good clone like yeah

1930
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,880
and then years and years later

1931
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:40,960
caleb runs a bunch of uh you know a

1932
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:43,760
couple rooms of chem 91 s ones

1933
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,358
and a bunch of them look like that maui

1934
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,520
dog cut

1935
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,598
yeah so of course because

1936
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,119
because you know so it probably was

1937
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,880
like you could put some pictures that he

1938
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,200
took right up against some really nice

1939
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,838
pictures of that maui dog from 99 or

1940
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:59,118
2000 or whatever and they look almost

1941
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:00,960
identical

1942
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,160
and so you could imagine it being bag

1943
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,838
seed

1944
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:05,519
coming out of

1945
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,038
coming out of that weed

1946
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:08,480
you know and that's one of the things

1947
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,280
like that's one of the coolest things to

1948
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,679
me about s1s is when if you just if you

1949
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,000
do that you can if you do an s1 because

1950
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,960
i've gone up there and i've seen

1951
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,440
you know a half a room of of urkel s

1952
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,798
ones and half a room of mendo ps ones

1953
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,798
and you can tell just by if you're a

1954
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,239
breeder at all that these things are not

1955
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:27,679
related

1956
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,239
like you don't see any similar

1957
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:32,480
expressions whatsoever right

1958
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,798
yeah and that's the same thing with this

1959
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,440
feed that was that that he was calling

1960
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,199
mendo perps and saying oh i made the

1961
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,679
mendo purpose i don't even think that he

1962
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,719
was i mean this [ __ ] was some nasty

1963
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,519
mendo

1964
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,480
perps it just was not mendo perps it

1965
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,480
wasn't

1966
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,838
the same thing to this day i'm still

1967
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,519
like [ __ ] i wish i could get some of

1968
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:52,880
those seeds because they were these buds

1969
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:54,400
that were like

1970
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,960
way chunkier than any of this other

1971
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,039
stuff and a really cool obviously

1972
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,760
afghani probably pure

1973
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,480
really sweet really nice but probably

1974
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,799
totally unrelated to both

1975
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,318
strains you know what i mean sure but

1976
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,480
like

1977
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,719
not not without value just because it

1978
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,798
has a funny name or a funny story you're

1979
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,759
still like [ __ ] i want to get my hands

1980
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:17,759
on that

1981
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,440
on that stuff and you know that at this

1982
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:22,000
point is probably gone like he's

1983
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:24,399
probably from now from from a long time

1984
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,158
ago he probably like ah purple went out

1985
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,759
the door that was in the purple craze

1986
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,198
yeah and then

1987
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,679
he probably started growing diesel and

1988
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,678
didn't even keep his seeds you know

1989
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,119
because i mean it's i mean the purple

1990
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,838
craze had

1991
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,439
what 15 or 18-year break between when it

1992
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:42,158
was hella popular before it got hella

1993
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,639
popular again

1994
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:48,479
right yeah 15 years something like that

1995
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:50,400
it went you know 0506 everybody

1996
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:54,000
i mean i don't know

1997
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:57,599
cookies cookies brought back purple weed

1998
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,600
in 2011

1999
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,960
yeah so it it really only took a little

2000
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,278
break but as far as like urkel type

2001
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,239
purple even sweet purple like gelato it

2002
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,880
took between urkel and gelato to be back

2003
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:13,439
where people wanted sweet perps and not

2004
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,039
doughy perps or whatever not so missed a

2005
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,719
big era where there were a few of us

2006
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:18,798
like me and bodhi and a few of us that

2007
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,719
were only doing purples

2008
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:23,039
so yeah we didn't let it die but it

2009
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,560
definitely died down i just mean in the

2010
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,158
sense what i was more speaking of in

2011
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,839
terms of like

2012
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:31,119
like the market demanding it so much

2013
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:33,439
not that it was

2014
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:36,079
down but like there was an era when we

2015
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,719
were talking about like in the mid 2000s

2016
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,838
where like purple like purple weed was

2017
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,679
the thing

2018
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,838
and everyone wanted purple wheat and

2019
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,520
like purple weed never went away

2020
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:46,719
but like i would say the last couple

2021
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,080
years

2022
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,239
all of a sudden all my friends have been

2023
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,439
like well i guess purple wheat is is is

2024
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,919
in again

2025
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,000
people say my weed out you know i

2026
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,640
haven't heard i haven't heard oh this is

2027
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,319
fire but it's like not purple enough

2028
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,600
in a long time

2029
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:04,079
but that's what you used to hear about

2030
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,840
that summer grown urkel

2031
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,000
you'd be looking for it's earth but it

2032
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,440
like it didn't it didn't darken up on

2033
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,960
you you know like it didn't get because

2034
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,319
it was hot in summer you know so it'd

2035
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,198
stay kind of greenish and they're like

2036
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,880
oh it's not quite purple

2037
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,279
darks that's green grapes we don't want

2038
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,279
that yeah

2039
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,520
yeah the purple craze too is interesting

2040
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,440
because

2041
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,360
it was the weed that made people want it

2042
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:28,479
initially it wasn't so much that it was

2043
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,759
purple

2044
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:33,839
um and it really popularized stuff being

2045
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,520
purple for a while but it's trippy

2046
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,000
because like

2047
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,560
we in mendo there was always a lot of

2048
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,640
purple weed all the way back because the

2049
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,560
purple in a lot of cases comes out of

2050
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,800
these old afghani types

2051
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,719
and so people had purple it wasn't that

2052
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,719
it wasn't a thing it was that there was

2053
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,079
no premium on it people were like some

2054
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,079
of them are green

2055
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,960
some of them are purple some of them are

2056
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:59,600
50 50 and it didn't really matter at all

2057
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,119
so some people had had like real

2058
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,199
varieties

2059
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:05,760
that were like they're purple like this

2060
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:07,439
[ __ ] is purple my buddy jed and his and

2061
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,000
his dad they had like

2062
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,919
this purple that was just straight solid

2063
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,760
purple and it ran really late and it was

2064
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,760
really peppery and dank

2065
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,159
um not so might know these guys they're

2066
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,760
from between like here and willets but

2067
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:20,879
it was like the most

2068
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,000
purple

2069
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,079
um

2070
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,238
like it was so saturated you know but

2071
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,960
that's like also how like big blue was

2072
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:31,519
which i saw as early as the

2073
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,760
as the mid 90s you roll a joint you lick

2074
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,840
the paper and it bleeds through and the

2075
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,560
whole paper turns purple where you lick

2076
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,719
it

2077
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,560
and um and then even that way back

2078
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,760
before that like you asked me what's the

2079
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,800
first weed i can remember like 1989 was

2080
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:49,280
a common popular clone which when i say

2081
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,400
common and popular i'm from a small area

2082
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:54,880
yeah with a group of people so

2083
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,198
it's popular and common if it comes from

2084
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,840
leggett and willits it doesn't mean that

2085
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:01,359
there's 2000 it's not like now where

2086
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,520
it's like oh it's blue dream it's

2087
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,279
[ __ ] all over the states or whatever

2088
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,040
it just means that like

2089
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,800
it made its rounds and it wasn't just

2090
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,560
one or two families that had it it was

2091
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,760
actually something that was like you

2092
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:16,239
know it got around and uh so as far back

2093
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,640
as the 80s there was already a clone

2094
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:20,158
that was around and that people were

2095
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,840
really liking that was like it was

2096
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,759
purple and it was kind of more of a red

2097
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,440
or purple as opposed to a blue or purple

2098
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,560
it was really [ __ ] pretty

2099
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,559
but um

2100
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,000
yeah

2101
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,880
on top of the weed that would turn

2102
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,840
purple just naturally there was a lot of

2103
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:38,560
afghan blended stuff in mendo that would

2104
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,719
turn purple with the cold

2105
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,520
uh if you let it go if it got a light

2106
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,039
frost or something in october especially

2107
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,800
if you took like all your what people

2108
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:48,158
used to take their their what we call

2109
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,079
the first cut

2110
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,839
and they would take all the big tops

2111
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:53,600
first because you were scared of those

2112
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,440
rotting you know and you wanted to get

2113
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,280
some money in the barn and then you

2114
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,599
would let your seconds your second and

2115
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,359
third round sit and a lot of times and

2116
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,520
you and you'd want those to ripen up a

2117
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:06,238
bit more and so a lot of times those

2118
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,159
would go through some more cold nights

2119
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,639
and those cold nights would bring out

2120
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,799
that like latent afghan

2121
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,640
um you know purpleness so there was two

2122
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,840
things there was like weed that just

2123
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,960
turned purple naturally in most

2124
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,279
conditions and that was like that was

2125
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,279
around and then there was a lot of weed

2126
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,719
that if you grew it outdoor and you let

2127
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:27,439
it run late and it went through some

2128
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:30,640
cold weather that it would turn purple

2129
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,559
but it took some like in the 30s nights

2130
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,199
to make it pop and sometimes it's like

2131
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,120
being too like basically overdone and

2132
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,599
created and not really that good a weed

2133
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:41,359
at that point like a real purple a real

2134
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,440
purple weed has to be like you could

2135
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:46,000
like grow it indoor

2136
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,839
and it'll be purple or you can grow it

2137
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
outdoor and cut it before it turns to

2138
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,199
[ __ ] and it'll be purple like even urkel

2139
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,600
outside

2140
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,759
didn't like to get um

2141
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,079
purple as much

2142
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,520
indoor it was easier to get it purple

2143
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:01,279
and outside

2144
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,040
it for whatever reason and i've seen

2145
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,000
this with a lot of things like hindu

2146
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:08,000
inside would get a little bit purple but

2147
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,198
outside it would never get a touch of

2148
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,119
purple right

2149
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:13,119
and then um

2150
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,198
it could i don't know if it's like the

2151
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,198
spectrum or what what it is because i

2152
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:19,599
know it's not just cold because indoor

2153
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:21,678
you usually have it more controlled

2154
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,560
but um but urkel was one of those ones

2155
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:25,359
where

2156
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:28,159
it wasn't that great in the weather it

2157
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:29,679
it was very kind of hairy on the inside

2158
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:31,599
and it would like to start to get a

2159
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,760
little bit of mold outdoor

2160
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,079
if you were not in the greatest area and

2161
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,039
then you would have to cut your real big

2162
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:39,198
chunk

2163
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,960
and then when you left you would leave

2164
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:43,198
the small buds like he's saying and then

2165
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,198
they would turn really dark and it would

2166
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:46,799
be like your little buds that weren't

2167
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:48,960
that great even if some of them were

2168
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,119
little people like this that weren't

2169
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,119
trimmed very well but it would be really

2170
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:57,039
dark and people would be like those are

2171
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,039
the ones we want that stuff oh

2172
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,600
people wanted color

2173
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,560
at that point and that that but that was

2174
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,079
like her time when color mattered was

2175
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,360
with urkel whereas before that it was

2176
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,719
like a purple you know green is a bomb

2177
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,960
and then

2178
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,000
we want darks and that was that was a

2179
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,760
weird time

2180
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,319
let's start moving in

2181
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,560
to nowadays what you're working with up

2182
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,559
in mendo now currently gene like what

2183
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,239
you're seeing around the scene nowadays

2184
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,920
as far as breeding goes what you're

2185
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:28,959
finding around nowadays that that you're

2186
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,960
enjoying breeding with

2187
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,279
other things comes to mind

2188
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:35,198
there's some p there's some people who

2189
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,920
have cool things that are from back in

2190
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,719
the era we're talking about where they

2191
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,440
they used to have um

2192
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,439
cool stuff and then you talk to them and

2193
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,519
they're like they were actually like

2194
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,479
into plants and stuff so they've kept

2195
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,239
things

2196
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,718
and so there's like cool little things

2197
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:54,639
here and there that kind of pop out

2198
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,560
um and i always try to like check them

2199
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,640
out just to see if because every once in

2200
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,840
a while something's really really dank

2201
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,320
yeah um

2202
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,560
but like for the most part i really try

2203
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,079
to focus on like digging through the

2204
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,880
stuff i have because i know that i

2205
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:12,158
haven't done a good job of really

2206
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,760
um exploring all the stuff that i make

2207
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:14,960
because i'll make a lot of stuff and

2208
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,079
then i'll

2209
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,880
i'll pop whatever looks really the most

2210
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:24,079
attractive right away yeah all breeders

2211
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,800
that do it for a while have a pile

2212
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,279
of

2213
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,000
it's one thing

2214
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:30,479
but

2215
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,158
your instincts aren't always

2216
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,959
going to be correct so like i'm always

2217
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:36,960
like i try to avoid trying to pick up

2218
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:40,000
too much stuff here and there

2219
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,158
so i try to kind of like take what i

2220
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,359
consider to be my ones that are really

2221
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,559
like the backbone of what i've done

2222
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,559
and then

2223
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,800
do outcrosses with them here and there

2224
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,640
to make cool stuff but then keep really

2225
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,320
trying to like focus on them so those

2226
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:58,320
ones are like like pina grape soda skunk

2227
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:00,840
the jarrow and root beer stuff which are

2228
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,399
kind of almost the same

2229
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,319
um

2230
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,079
the lime stuff which is really my

2231
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,799
favorite and then i have like the

2232
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:10,238
various kush lines that i do

2233
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,480
um

2234
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:14,399
that are more like the og type stuff and

2235
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,479
then like the more little odd like the

2236
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,679
sky cuddler kush or sky cut their double

2237
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,319
kush and

2238
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,239
um those ones are all ones that i try

2239
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:24,238
i'm trying to like

2240
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,399
find what's really the best in them and

2241
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,399
take them those directions and then you

2242
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,920
know i put out a little bit of them for

2243
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,158
other people to do the same thing when

2244
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,640
they're a little looser so that it's not

2245
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:36,000
all left up completely to me saying this

2246
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,280
is where it should go because some

2247
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,719
people they like

2248
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,000
everybody likes something different

2249
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,079
somebody wants to

2250
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,960
somebody wants the straight og one and

2251
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,279
i'm like

2252
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,439
i like some influence from the og but

2253
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:50,479
og's a thing so i'm not really making

2254
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:52,158
anything if i make this og so i like

2255
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,158
have it where

2256
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:56,158
i did one not so saw a little bit of the

2257
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,198
og work that i was doing when he was up

2258
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,198
last time

2259
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,198
it's like very it's very kind of

2260
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:03,359
targeted there and it's kind of reached

2261
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:05,919
that point where it's good

2262
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:09,119
the high i like a little bit better

2263
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:12,319
um than og just but some people maybe

2264
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:15,198
wouldn't because they want the more real

2265
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,960
intensity but it's a little bit more

2266
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:18,319
clear i'd say

2267
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,480
um

2268
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:23,439
but uh yeah i mean i just i'm always

2269
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:25,198
trying to like figure out really

2270
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:28,399
narrow it down but those ones that i

2271
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:30,319
named are like the ones that go back

2272
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:32,238
the most and that have been the most

2273
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:34,319
well received and that i've explored the

2274
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:36,079
most but what's [ __ ] up is that like

2275
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:37,359
in those same years when i made all this

2276
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:39,600
different stuff there's all these other

2277
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,559
things that i didn't ever even try yeah

2278
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,800
and

2279
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,880
and for a long time and then not so

2280
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,800
knows how it is here like

2281
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,640
you could make a lot of seeds and if you

2282
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,159
weren't on the internet like who's ever

2283
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,840
going to want to grow

2284
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,960
all the seeds

2285
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,039
so

2286
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,880
you're like thinking you're doing all

2287
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:58,960
this [ __ ] for nothing and after a while

2288
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,119
you kind of just feel like a geek like

2289
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,600
doing weird [ __ ] for no

2290
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:06,719
for like no end like what is ever gonna

2291
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,480
i i can only get to some of them nobody

2292
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,640
wants to grow anything i don't [ __ ]

2293
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,639
know anybody i only know these few

2294
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,400
people so i have like these few friends

2295
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,199
like my buddy's mom

2296
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,439
grows them for medical and kills it and

2297
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,359
my one buddy couldn't get cloned so he

2298
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:23,839
decided to do a big run and then he

2299
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:25,519
killed it he wants more seeds and you

2300
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,520
know like there's these little pockets

2301
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,120
here and there but like i wasn't on the

2302
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,120
internet until

2303
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:32,119
2012

2304
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:38,399
so like i said forums

2305
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,719
um my buddy reservation labs who who

2306
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:43,039
used to work with me up here

2307
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,800
who's not from here he was on the

2308
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:46,158
internet and i wish i would have known

2309
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,199
he didn't ever talk to me about it i

2310
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:48,639
remember him

2311
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,319
you knew about

2312
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,800
[ __ ] like he got all this [ __ ] from

2313
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:54,158
me you know yeah and so it was one of

2314
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,159
these funny things where i was like i

2315
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,599
wish i would have [ __ ] i like there

2316
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,000
was no there was no reason for it to

2317
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,760
come up really yeah other than if i said

2318
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,238
we should do but you know i was like i

2319
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,679
was just like doing weed [ __ ] he's like

2320
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:07,519
what do you want to be on the internet

2321
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,520
for like that'd be he probably thought

2322
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,760
i'd think he was sketchy for being on

2323
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,159
the internet with weed like probably

2324
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,159
say like

2325
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:18,559
where like you live up here and i i

2326
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,639
would say that probably like

2327
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,480
people have uh people have a lot of

2328
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:25,039
misconceptions about what it's like to

2329
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:27,759
actually live up here you know uh our

2330
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:29,519
bubble is is really weird in that regard

2331
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,440
and that you can be really insulated and

2332
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,800
like everyone you know my everyone that

2333
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:34,719
you hang out with for the most part

2334
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,760
might grow weed but that doesn't mean

2335
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,760
that like

2336
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,760
you're tied into the larger community

2337
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,079
like i you know i kind of call it when i

2338
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,400
got on ig you know i did the forum thing

2339
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:46,000
a long time ago but then i had a break

2340
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:48,000
and i kind of felt like i crawled out

2341
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,639
from under my rock

2342
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,279
because we i was just living that like

2343
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,480
mendo life you know or came out of the

2344
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,559
closet

2345
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,799
yeah you know however you want to put it

2346
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,560
however you want to put it you know but

2347
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,000
you know even with with him with seeds

2348
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,679
it's the same thing with me with you

2349
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,560
know people ask me about my collection

2350
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:08,639
of clones and i've tended to try to keep

2351
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,320
things that i like but it's a total

2352
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,560
[ __ ] because you know he's talking

2353
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,479
about trying to get friends to to grow

2354
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,880
his seeds

2355
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:19,198
me getting friends to back up my strains

2356
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,079
that aren't currently popular

2357
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:22,719
[ __ ]

2358
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:24,960
it's so hard you know i mean even when

2359
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,880
times were easier four or five years ago

2360
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,198
people wanted to have mothers of the

2361
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,960
things they were currently blooming for

2362
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,399
for flower

2363
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,439
they didn't want to back up a bunch of

2364
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,599
stuff

2365
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:37,198
you know and then it would get popular

2366
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,880
again and people would be like hey do

2367
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:40,719
you still have that

2368
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,639
man that thing that you had was super

2369
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:45,359
amazing could i get it and so i end up

2370
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,359
like having people back up stuff for me

2371
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:49,279
but i try to like stuff it with people

2372
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:51,439
that actually love the two or three or

2373
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,800
four cuts that go their direction

2374
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:54,799
because i'm like oh if they love it

2375
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,119
they'll hold on to it you know and i

2376
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,719
think there's an aspect now

2377
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:00,238
and i don't exactly know how it's going

2378
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,639
to change but

2379
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,119
i would say like maybe five or six years

2380
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,880
ago before the the

2381
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:08,559
maybe when would you say what would you

2382
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,560
say gene the the

2383
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,320
it started getting blown out bad about

2384
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,000
five years ago huh before even the

2385
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:15,920
legalization started there was like a

2386
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,158
year or two but

2387
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,079
for seeds at least there was a thing

2388
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:22,719
where like emerald cup and some of these

2389
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:24,479
different things as you guys both know

2390
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,239
there was a bunch of growers with extra

2391
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,839
money in their pocket

2392
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:30,000
it would come to these things and they

2393
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,319
would want to get some fresh seeds and a

2394
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,880
lot of outdoor growers wanted to grow

2395
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:36,960
from seed because there was this idea

2396
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,960
that seeds got bigger than clones and so

2397
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,039
on and so forth you know and had more

2398
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,198
vigor or whatever and so people were a

2399
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,479
little bit more willing to experiment

2400
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:45,839
but now

2401
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,079
it almost like there needs to be like

2402
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,920
some kind of change in the regulations

2403
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,600
or laws because

2404
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,119
like the nurseries just want to grow

2405
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,800
what's popular

2406
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:56,319
and then they want to sell popular

2407
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,320
clones to

2408
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,399
people that have you know the ability to

2409
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:02,238
grow flower and those guys want to grow

2410
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:04,559
what's popular because they can't even

2411
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,799
sell direct to the public nor can they

2412
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,960
sell direct to a dispensary they have to

2413
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,639
convince a distro to buy it

2414
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,840
and then that distro

2415
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:16,560
you know has to um you know has to come

2416
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,079
back and uh and decide to sell that to

2417
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,120
like a shop

2418
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:23,840
where the days where where you know gene

2419
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:25,359
could have a friend go into into a shop

2420
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,800
in the bay and say i've got some i've

2421
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,960
got a couple duffel bags of some

2422
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,560
fireweed are you interested

2423
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,600
those days are gone

2424
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,400
yeah

2425
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,199
so

2426
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:39,039
so even even any breeder whether it's

2427
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:40,719
it's him or you or caleb or anybody else

2428
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,639
even just getting someone to be able to

2429
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:44,719
see it

2430
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,719
someone to care about it

2431
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,319
you know somebody could grow a bunch of

2432
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:51,198
his stuff and be like oh my god this

2433
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:54,880
shit's fire you know or or whatever and

2434
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:57,599
then the distro is like i don't care

2435
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,119
and then the public won't even see it

2436
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,039
and then yeah and then too with with

2437
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,719
like with seeds growing from seeds it's

2438
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:04,560
hard because

2439
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,880
uh you know

2440
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,679
there's not really nobody really has any

2441
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,760
seeds that are so true breeding

2442
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,880
that you can grow them and then have it

2443
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,520
be like a true harvest batch

2444
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,400
where you can say

2445
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,760
all of these are

2446
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:23,359
22

2447
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,960
yeah thc

2448
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:27,920
all of these are

2449
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,039
whatever you know whatever it is

2450
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,239
like um

2451
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:34,079
like uh like the uh

2452
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:35,599
i haven't tested a ton of them but like

2453
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:37,519
the grape soda skunks the ones that we

2454
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,719
tested they're like in the mid teens on

2455
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:42,880
cbd the thc is almost not there it's

2456
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:45,760
like turned into almost like a hemp line

2457
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,239
but it's really [ __ ] dank you know

2458
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,079
um and is really close to being at that

2459
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:52,638
point but

2460
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,399
even if even if you got it to be there

2461
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,319
it's like he said like the distro why

2462
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:59,119
would the distro want that they're like

2463
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:01,359
no we want something with whatever in

2464
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:03,760
the name it has to sound like

2465
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,238
relevant with this little box that we

2466
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,119
know is definitely marketable you know

2467
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:08,319
so

2468
01:25:07,119 --> 01:25:09,760
um

2469
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,519
you know it's one of those it's one of

2470
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,280
those weird things but just seeds in

2471
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,120
general because of that it's like okay

2472
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,639
they're all a little bit different

2473
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:18,399
you know um

2474
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,719
like i have a lot of things

2475
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:23,759
they're always in the the low 20 percent

2476
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:25,840
thc or they're always in the mid 20 thc

2477
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,679
so it's like you can do them but it

2478
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:30,000
doesn't really like

2479
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,319
um

2480
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,560
it's still it's still hard to translate

2481
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:37,279
to the market if it's not and then

2482
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:40,080
that's why like over the last

2483
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:41,359
however many years i mean i got my hands

2484
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,119
on

2485
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:45,759
cookies when it was like unknown

2486
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:48,319
basically you know and i i didn't even

2487
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,560
really i was like cool

2488
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:52,960
you know this is what these dudes in san

2489
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:55,440
francisco have and everybody really

2490
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,639
likes it in that circle and [ __ ] and

2491
01:25:55,439 --> 01:26:00,158
um

2492
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:02,639
i started doing stuff with it because

2493
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:03,920
it it was neat [ __ ] it reminded me of

2494
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,440
neat old

2495
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,560
stuff you know

2496
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:11,279
and um so then like over the years i've

2497
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,600
tried to do like i did like the stuff

2498
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,840
with the gelato and all that

2499
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,280
just because you look at how it is and

2500
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,880
people are like oh those were really

2501
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:21,359
cool but do you have anything that's

2502
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,199
like the stuff that people are talking

2503
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:26,319
about do you have

2504
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:28,319
you know gelato 41 do you have blah blah

2505
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,399
blah and i'm like well i mean

2506
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:32,559
you know people you want to give people

2507
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:36,000
the seeds that they're going to grow and

2508
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:39,679
that's how it's turned into um

2509
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,719
a a weird thing where

2510
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,480
like i'm like running parallels you know

2511
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,960
like i have like all the stuff that i

2512
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:48,879
really really want to do and some of

2513
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,560
that really actually is [ __ ] that has

2514
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,400
that stuff in it i do have cookie and

2515
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,639
gelato work that i really really like

2516
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,158
yeah but at the same time you're like

2517
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:59,600
you have to have these things that

2518
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:02,238
people know okay i can get my new clone

2519
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,280
that's a new flavor where when i go to

2520
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:04,879
do it

2521
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:06,800
i can have

2522
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,199
something where people are gonna go okay

2523
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,440
i can this is something that is actually

2524
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,879
can go on the market and everything's

2525
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:14,799
been like

2526
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,119
put into such a small

2527
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,400
such a small box now that you kind of

2528
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:20,479
have to

2529
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:23,198
go with the flow to an extent you know

2530
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,158
like you can't just no no i'm just gonna

2531
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:26,319
put

2532
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:27,839
acapulco gold everybody will like no

2533
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:29,359
they're not gonna want it

2534
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,400
they've been talking about like doing

2535
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,639
some like

2536
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,319
uh making some laws or some amendments

2537
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:35,920
to what's going on where you could have

2538
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:37,759
some like farmer's markets and you could

2539
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,639
do direct sales

2540
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,880
um

2541
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:43,039
that's really what it would kind of take

2542
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,800
in order to get a bunch of variety out

2543
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,399
there is because you know i mean you

2544
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,440
guys both know like when you used to go

2545
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:50,319
to like a

2546
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:52,479
um you know a high times cup or a

2547
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:55,279
emerald cup or something like that it

2548
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,359
was kind of like a weed swap meat

2549
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:59,359
you could crack open people's jars

2550
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:01,519
there'd be some like furry dudes with

2551
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,759
from some place some random spot up

2552
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,520
north and they had a bunch of big jars

2553
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,039
this big of all kinds of weed and you

2554
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,400
could crack and you could smell it you

2555
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:10,079
could check it out

2556
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:11,759
and so the way that they have it now

2557
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,359
where it's like you can't see most wheat

2558
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,800
in a store and you can't smell most

2559
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:16,880
wheat in a store

2560
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,880
they really like it they don't really

2561
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,400
have like a method for people to bring

2562
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,319
new things

2563
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,839
you know and like it there has to be

2564
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:26,399
something more than just like a couple

2565
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:28,960
people being able to hype something

2566
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,319
right and drive hype you know because

2567
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,480
there's a lot of good weed out there he

2568
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:34,960
was talking about it a minute ago but

2569
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,718
almost all my favorite weed and what i

2570
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,880
mean by favorite weed in terms of like

2571
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,198
the weed that gets me the highest

2572
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,279
it's almost all between 18 and 25

2573
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:45,359
percent

2574
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:47,920
in thc

2575
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:50,960
you know it's not so hard

2576
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,880
most of this 30 club i find to be very

2577
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,198
bland and boring week

2578
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,279
so there's something lost there when it

2579
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:59,279
gets above a certain quotient you know

2580
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:02,559
or people are breeding for numbers

2581
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:04,719
because people 20 years ago or longer

2582
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:08,719
people bred by like if you were breeding

2583
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:10,560
from high the high is an invisible trait

2584
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,760
right it's invisible like you just don't

2585
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,520
know so

2586
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,920
like a lot of times people things would

2587
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,600
get famous because they worked

2588
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,679
you know not always like he was talking

2589
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,199
about the flow like it barely it tasted

2590
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,920
great and it looked cool but it barely

2591
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:26,238
got you high but like a lot of weed got

2592
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:28,719
popular because it worked well

2593
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:31,119
you know and now it's kind of about the

2594
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:32,960
name and the look and the thc percentage

2595
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:35,519
and the numbers and not really much

2596
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,198
about like how does it work

2597
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,040
and so i think there's a lot of unique

2598
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:41,039
highs on a lot of different aspects

2599
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:42,319
probably in various people's stuff and

2600
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:43,760
you're like well how do i get it to the

2601
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:45,679
public

2602
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,840
you know how do i

2603
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:50,158
you know um how do i get the how do i

2604
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,199
get the public to shine on me for a

2605
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,319
minute and want everything that i have

2606
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,559
and so

2607
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:58,319
you know and then nurseries nurseries

2608
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,400
just want to sell as many clones as they

2609
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:03,119
can to as many legal farms as they can

2610
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:04,879
so they're picking the 10 or 15 most

2611
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:06,719
popular cuts that they think they can

2612
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,719
sell the most of

2613
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,880
and that's what's on their menu this

2614
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,560
spring right now you can go and you can

2615
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,319
look at all these nurseries and these

2616
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,239
nurseries have decided

2617
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,279
what do i think i can sell the most of

2618
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:19,759
this year

2619
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:21,759
what do i think is a safe bet to mom up

2620
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,679
x number of moms of each one of these

2621
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,079
things that i can sell it on the legal

2622
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:28,639
market and they probably

2623
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,000
they probably have like uh

2624
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:33,199
a [ __ ] ton

2625
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,000
of cool strains that they're not selling

2626
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:37,919
to people but they have them

2627
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,279
but they're just yeah they just don't

2628
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,079
it's like they don't think there's gonna

2629
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:42,000
be

2630
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,119
i can't afford to have a hundred moms of

2631
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,279
that because i don't know if i'll be

2632
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:47,039
able to sell enough cuts

2633
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:48,559
yeah and it's uh it's all unfortunate

2634
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:50,560
because it all makes sense because you

2635
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,480
go well what what are you gonna do you

2636
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,480
know what i mean like whatever you're

2637
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:56,319
farming if you're farming

2638
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,839
if you're farming tomatoes and you know

2639
01:30:56,319 --> 01:31:00,238
people don't want

2640
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,520
like this kind of tomato then why the

2641
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:03,839
[ __ ] are you gonna farm that kind of

2642
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,440
tomato and if you're the nursery selling

2643
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,840
plants to grow

2644
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:10,238
something then why are you gonna if you

2645
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,239
know everybody's gonna buy granny smith

2646
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:13,678
apples and your [ __ ] half a nursery

2647
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:15,439
that sells apple trees like you're not

2648
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,800
just gonna go but i got a million of

2649
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:18,559
these and people are gonna be like cool

2650
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,880
but like where's those ones and then

2651
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,639
you're like well but i i have these and

2652
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,800
then you're like well [ __ ] you know

2653
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:26,800
it's like joe dirks [ __ ] snakes and

2654
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,679
sparklers you know either you gotta have

2655
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,639
the ship in people people want like it's

2656
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,560
uh

2657
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:35,119
it's just this loop that just gets it

2658
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,880
just gets stuck and it um

2659
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:39,599
i don't know it's unfortunate but it's

2660
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,600
like it's just i don't it's how it's how

2661
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,120
everything is is laid out and i think

2662
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,679
part of it has to do like with what

2663
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:48,399
you're saying it would be nice

2664
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:50,560
if you could go okay

2665
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:52,879
uh like there's a system of okay

2666
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:55,360
everybody can get free samples everybody

2667
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,600
can look at a jar everybody can feel it

2668
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,799
everybody can roll it up and see what

2669
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,880
they like

2670
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,360
but what happens is it's like somebody

2671
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,960
goes in they go

2672
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:07,920
i mean

2673
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,158
it's in a bag it's a sealed

2674
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:13,279
i mean what's the number this one has

2675
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:15,599
the big number i can't see anything else

2676
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:17,439
and then now people too say like

2677
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,280
oh look at the terpene test don't look

2678
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:22,799
at the thc test and i'm like well high

2679
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:24,880
terpenes don't mean [ __ ] yeah a bunch

2680
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,119
something's flavorful skittles only has

2681
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,039
like one point six percent or some [ __ ]

2682
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:31,679
yeah it's not even it just has tons of

2683
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,119
little which is [ __ ] amazing you know

2684
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,639
and then there's like all those things

2685
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:37,359
that are like that and some of them that

2686
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:39,359
are high are really good but it's not

2687
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:40,719
that the numbers never tell you and then

2688
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,238
even if you know

2689
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:43,840
that everybody else says it's really

2690
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:46,319
good you might still smoke it and be

2691
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,600
like a lot of people could think that

2692
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:50,000
blue dream

2693
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,679
is the greatest weed ever because people

2694
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,679
love it so much and a lot of people

2695
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,520
could think that blue dream is the worst

2696
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,000
weed ever because so many people hate it

2697
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,840
so much but the only way to know if you

2698
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,840
really like blue dream or you hate it is

2699
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,159
to smoke it and some people will be like

2700
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,159
[ __ ] it's like [ __ ] cilantro right or

2701
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:07,759
garlic some people are like that tastes

2702
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:09,679
like [ __ ] and some people are like that

2703
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,360
tastes like heaven and you've got to be

2704
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,119
able to

2705
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,279
you take blue dream and there's some

2706
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:18,719
stuff like blue dream or green crack or

2707
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:20,559
you know uh or barry white in our area

2708
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:23,359
that get gets blown out and it gets a

2709
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,600
bad reputation but if you grow like a

2710
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:27,279
four to six ounce plant or you know or a

2711
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,520
half pound plant of that thing and you

2712
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:31,198
keep it kind of small and you treat it

2713
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,280
right it's delicious

2714
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,919
it gets a bad rep because there's some

2715
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:37,759
dudes that are pumping out eight to 12

2716
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,679
pound blue dreams

2717
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,360
that are kind of b grade

2718
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,319
and they get treated great and then

2719
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,158
there's all this weed and there's like

2720
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,960
oh blue dream sucks and it's like yeah

2721
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:48,719
that that that version of it does suck

2722
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,439
but if you took that strain and you grew

2723
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:53,760
six ounces of it in a 10 gallon pot you

2724
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:56,638
know in your side plot it would come out

2725
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,880
fire and it would probably be a nice jar

2726
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,880
i even grew i grew blue dream and i

2727
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,279
didn't i got it late but it was still

2728
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,960
big big ass plant i mean like that's

2729
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:07,359
what was crazy about blue dream was like

2730
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,840
i tossed in one out of like a

2731
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,880
like a four gallon bucket like an actual

2732
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,639
bucket

2733
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,199
that my buddy gave me that was a spare

2734
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:17,039
plant and i put it in really late like

2735
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:19,119
as a replacement and i still think i got

2736
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,279
like five pounds of wheat off of it and

2737
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:22,559
this big huge pretty big plant good

2738
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:24,719
sized plant i mean you wouldn't have

2739
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:27,760
thought it had that much wheat on it but

2740
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:29,679
dude the weed was all really [ __ ]

2741
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:34,159
killer like i've always grown like i

2742
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:37,600
always had the 25 plants and i um

2743
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:40,000
i was able to always have like really

2744
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,560
big plants that were just the same

2745
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,679
[ __ ] weed as i as i had like

2746
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:47,119
anywhere else but i didn't have [ __ ]

2747
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:49,279
350 of them you know what i mean i just

2748
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:52,559
had like little gardens so they're big

2749
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:55,118
plants but very you know taken care of

2750
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,080
and and you know keeping track of what

2751
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:58,000
um

2752
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:00,238
i think a lot of people who had really

2753
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,760
big plants and who had a ton of them

2754
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:04,000
it's like

2755
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,079
harvest is october 4th we're cutting

2756
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,920
this [ __ ] down or

2757
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:10,000
you know like these different you get

2758
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,319
these like real vague growing styles and

2759
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,719
for me i'd be like oh okay the north

2760
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:16,319
side of this plant is really [ __ ]

2761
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,639
done so i'm going to go ahead and cut

2762
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,158
like this section of this plant and then

2763
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,560
it looks like the stuff that's on the

2764
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:24,399
very top is pretty close and then i cut

2765
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,560
that and then be like oh the south side

2766
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,079
is not quite you know big plants are a

2767
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,480
whole trip because it's like a whole

2768
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:33,118
garden on one plant so the south side

2769
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:35,678
finishes way later like sometimes like

2770
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:37,439
you know ten days later

2771
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,440
two weeks later and the stuff on the

2772
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:40,638
backside is like done and if you go

2773
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:43,039
through and you harvest your whole

2774
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:46,079
garden at once you're like okay sweet

2775
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:48,800
well now we have the backside is [ __ ]

2776
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:51,118
you know 14 days too far and the front

2777
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,880
side's premature and the middle is great

2778
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,319
but [ __ ] those tops probably should

2779
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,118
have come down because they're kind of

2780
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:59,039
[ __ ] [ __ ] off up there now and so

2781
01:35:57,118 --> 01:35:59,839
people's stuff just winds up being like

2782
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:02,319
this

2783
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,639
this this this vague handling method

2784
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:05,759
that it's not specific enough you know

2785
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,719
but um

2786
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,679
but like

2787
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,118
it is

2788
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,118
there's an aspect to him and i have

2789
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:13,039
talked about this years ago where

2790
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:14,559
like there are some strains that can

2791
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:16,479
maintain their quality as they get

2792
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,639
bigger and bigger and bigger maintain

2793
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:21,039
their resin and things like that but

2794
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,159
there is this ratio of like an in

2795
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:23,840
general

2796
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:25,839
like the there's a range where the

2797
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,400
plant's going to give you better weed if

2798
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,079
it's smaller it's not in all cases but

2799
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:33,359
in a lot of cases and if you get it too

2800
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:35,198
big it puts so much energy into like the

2801
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,359
stems and the structure and you're

2802
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:38,960
building scaffolding around it and it

2803
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:41,519
becomes a huge pain in the ass to

2804
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,118
maintain and the stem on the base is

2805
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,280
like this [ __ ] big and you're worried

2806
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:47,279
about it cracking and you're like like

2807
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:49,519
gluing it when it splits because you're

2808
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:51,759
worried about rot and so there's just a

2809
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,760
lot of things that like make it like

2810
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,560
harder like he was just saying harder to

2811
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,960
like harvest it in the perfect window

2812
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,039
you're just like ride this beast until

2813
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,719
it gets to somewhat done and you can

2814
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:04,639
start taking some of it down and you

2815
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,399
don't lose it to the million different

2816
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,960
things that can [ __ ] with you

2817
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:10,559
you know and if you get 99 of those

2818
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,719
that's really [ __ ] hard to like

2819
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,719
really keep up with that and if you just

2820
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:17,920
go ahead and take the same clone and do

2821
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:19,760
a big garden of seven gallon pots and

2822
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,000
your plants are just these little plants

2823
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,760
and that's like oh every bud is perfect

2824
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,760
and every plant is totally even and

2825
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,760
there is no front side there is no back

2826
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,480
side they're too small for that you know

2827
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,400
and

2828
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:33,039
you yeah like if you really want good

2829
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:35,679
weed like it is a lot easier to do it in

2830
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:38,000
in small pots i was doing it

2831
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:39,359
yeah or even beds but

2832
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,679
you can do it in bed with just

2833
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:43,359
moderate-sized plants you know i mean we

2834
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,480
grew giants

2835
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:46,799
in mendo

2836
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,479
um because you know there used to be you

2837
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,560
know plant counts were pretty intense

2838
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:51,839
and if you got over a hundred plant a

2839
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,679
hundred plants

2840
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,159
the feds could get you

2841
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,319
you know um and then you know mendo was

2842
01:37:56,158 --> 01:38:00,479
like okay you know like we'll give you

2843
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:02,319
25.

2844
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,479
25 we won't really [ __ ] with you too

2845
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,479
much you know you can have your 25 and

2846
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:09,678
you're safe and then so people are like

2847
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,879
well how do i get 250 pounds off 25

2848
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,199
plants

2849
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:15,279
how do i get 200 pounds off 20 plants

2850
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:17,599
you know whatever it might be and so you

2851
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:19,759
start developing these methods based on

2852
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,320
like the rules

2853
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,840
blue dream blue dream you know

2854
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:25,198
blue dream and you know oh i'm going to

2855
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,840
grow green crack and that's kind of

2856
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,759
where green crack or blue dream or barry

2857
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,760
white get bad names because people are

2858
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,239
like oh i can get this clone that'll

2859
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,960
give me this much weed on a reliable

2860
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:39,359
basis and i can put 25 of them in my

2861
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,760
garden and that's my season

2862
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:43,279
right and now there's too much b grade

2863
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,800
blue dream and people are like blue

2864
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:46,559
dream sucks

2865
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,320
they're like no there's just a lot of

2866
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,800
commercial b grade blue dream on the

2867
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:53,118
market it doesn't hate

2868
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,880
i i have friends who like really love

2869
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,639
certain types of weed and like you can

2870
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,159
give them the best blue dream ever they

2871
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,560
can grow it themselves or whatever in

2872
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:02,879
that terp profile they just [ __ ] hate

2873
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,639
it some people hate terpenoline

2874
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,118

01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
different like nobody likes the same

2881
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,760
things everybody doesn't like blue

2882
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,840
cheese and everybody doesn't like

2883
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,600

dude like some people

2885
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,960
ranch on everything and some people

2886
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,198
think ranch is [ __ ] disgusting you

2887
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,359
know so like when you have weed there's

2888
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:34,799
these profiles of these smells and stuff

2889
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:37,198
where it's like you know some people

2890
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,800
love to wear really heavy cologne they

2891
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:40,879
think they smell great when they come in

2892
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,119
a room and me when someone walks in a

2893
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,000
room with whatever heavy cologne it is

2894
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:48,639
it's probably 99 of the time i'm going

2895
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,600
to be like [ __ ] come on dude why are you

2896

2897
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,000
something that's like that smells so

2898
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,000
good you know it's just there's a lot of

2899
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,600
it a lot of it comes down to to

2900
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,359
preference you know like some people

2901
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,199
don't look really powerful wheat some

2902
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:03,039
people like really mellow wheat even if

2903
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:04,479
they've smoked a [ __ ] ton of weed you

2904
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,639
know like

2905
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:08,479
making all the green onions

2906
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:11,279
is that everyone loves root beer and

2907
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:13,279

01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:37,199
uh llf

2919
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:39,679
has some stuff sometimes

2920
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:42,399
um and that's basically the only people

2921
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:43,440
who i know who have anything really

2922
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:45,759
um

2923
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:47,759
here and there

2924
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,199
but um what are you working on right now

2925
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,800
what are you stoked about like right

2926
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:52,799
this second that you have

2927
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,719
inner [ __ ] you're like [ __ ] i can't wait

2928
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,119
for people to see this well maybe maybe

2929
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:59,359
we should ask him this it's spring

2930
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:00,960
what have you planted bro

2931
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:02,880
because i see

2932
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,480
with green like little greenhouses full

2933
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,239
of seed starts so you're obviously

2934
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,399
excited about some things because you're

2935
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:10,799
planting it's that time right you're

2936
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,638
popping seeds

2937
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,159
all right so this would be this has got

2938
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:15,679
i just got to be my last thing that i

2939
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:17,439
talked about because i i thought i

2940
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,440
figured that i was going to i figured

2941
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:22,238
lives are about an hour but we've

2942
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,759
managed to push into dnf

2943
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:24,638
yeah it's all right

2944
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,000
like this

2945
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:27,520
it's a disaster in there and i'm in

2946
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,399
trouble but uh

2947
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,600
um

2948
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:31,599
basically uh

2949
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,800
i have right now going a bunch of things

2950
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:39,440
that are like promising that either i

2951
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,760
have like people are testing out for me

2952
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:44,158
and i want to like get a get a hands-on

2953
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,000
idea of like okay how do they smoke so

2954
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:48,559
that i can line up what their feedback

2955
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,639
is with what i really think yeah

2956
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,639
or they're things that i think might be

2957
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,560
super intersex prone and i just want to

2958
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,719
see a little bit of them to see like are

2959
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,840
these things is it just are they is it

2960
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:00,719
intersex everywhere in there

2961
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,560
um so that we don't even plant more of

2962
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:05,840
them so if i think that they might be

2963
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,679
real problematic or i already know

2964
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,920
that they're the [ __ ] but i want to have

2965
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:13,199
an idea of what a few of them look like

2966
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,760
i have like 18 little starts going of

2967
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:19,198
those types right which isn't very much

2968
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,320
but it's enough to either yeah

2969
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:21,439
or

2970
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:23,759
to

2971
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:26,000
confirm what's already been done with

2972
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,840
other numbers elsewhere or even maybe

2973
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,719
that i have seen a little bit of stuff

2974
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,560
and then the other ones i have a tray of

2975
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,960
36 each

2976
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,239
so that i can really see

2977
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,920
what does

2978
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:40,319
you know what does it look like when you

2979
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,359
have basically three packs worth of

2980
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:42,399
seeds

2981
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:43,679
and then

2982
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:45,519
if

2983
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:48,480
it's a home run on that and i'm like

2984
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,320
holy [ __ ] every plant is great in this

2985
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:52,319
i can hear that statistically we're

2986
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,639
looking at something that's pretty good

2987
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:56,639
and if i look through those and there's

2988
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:58,719
nothing good in if there's not anything

2989
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,639
good in three packs of seeds then i'm

2990
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:02,880
like i have other [ __ ] that i can focus

2991
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:05,520
on so it's basically right now a big

2992
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:08,800
test run where i have about 50 things

i don't know whole bunch of different

3039
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,319
stuff but they're all that kind of stuff

3040
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,959
i'll do a post in a while that has like

3041
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:53,039
stuff up and uh

3042
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,560
and maybe a list of what all those

3043
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,399
different things are but anyway it's

3044
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,080
like twelve hundred and fifty plants

3045
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,879
basically

3046
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:02,800
eighteen of some 36 of the other

3047
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,079
um and

3048
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,679
and

3049
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:07,600
uh

3050
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,079
you know like i said that was my logic

3051
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,840
was like all right there's some that

3052
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:14,158
if i think maybe they're really

3053
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:16,880
problematic like animal cookies bat

3054
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:18,000
cross too sure try 18 or they all hurt

3055
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,239
them if they're not all hurt i'm like

3056
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,238
[ __ ] all right we'll try try try 36 of

3057
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:24,799
those you see what's it cause you know

3058
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:27,919
or try 50 of those and then like some

3059
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:30,159
pure limes uh lime one cross lime f5

3060
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,600
salam one bread to f5 put back on the

3061
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:33,839
originator

3062
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:36,400
um so i have like a targeted

3063
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:38,400
mother of targeted males

3064
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:40,559
that are put back on the more open

3065
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,638
mother so that that's a combination

3066
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,880
where this is already a predictable mom

3067
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:47,520
but now i have a real predictable

3068
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:51,359
male set that i put back on them

3069
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,560
um and then you know lime one back cross

3070
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:54,319
two

3071
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,239
and [ __ ] like that just a bunch of

3072
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:59,279
different stuff to look through and um

3073
01:45:56,238 --> 01:46:01,678
and uh you know pink champagne root beer

3074
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:03,840
and uh pink champagne lime pink

3075
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,079
champagne pina

3076
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,920
um and the pink champagne's not like the

3077
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:09,920
original it's a bag seed clone that i

3078
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,319
got from these dudes and it's super

3079
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,719
killer really really nice plant but

3080
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:17,759
that's what's going down i gotta go

3081
