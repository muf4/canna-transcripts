110
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,240
popping but back to the clip y'all y'all

111
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,679
know me I'm going off on tangents at all

112
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,879
[ __ ] times oh we said a f word but we

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,800
should be good I don't know maybe we're

114
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,918
not I

115
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,560
apologize but the way these work are

116
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,560
pretty simple you got a plant multiple

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,199
plants whatever you're working

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,879
with and you got a couple tops maybe

119
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,759
maybe couple branches growing too fast

120
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:58,478
too far up past everything else maybe

121
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,919
you want you into that hard training

122
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,719
that that tough training where you take

123
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,839
them stems and really uh you know high

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,000
stress train them and bend them down I

125
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,560
used to do that I like that kind of too

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,439
myself but I kept noticing when I got

127
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,800
them big [ __ ] fans rolling you know

128
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,519
sometimes and when you got them cramed

129
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,720
in there like I do um sometimes you can

130
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,719
pinch off that that circulation of or

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
the flow of the water to those tops and

132
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,919
they can die on you not always but it

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
does happen it always happens to your

134
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,519
best plants of course the ones you love

135
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,120
are the ones that going you really want

136
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,359
to yield out for you and see I'm popping

137
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,319
a lot of seeds and genetics that I don't

138
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,240
really know anything about so I got

139
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,600
these little clips and I'm ready to go

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,280
so basically they way they work and I

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,720
love them on these Blue Dream crosses

142
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,239
from Pac that I'm rocking out cuz these

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,400
things grow if you ain't ever grown some

144
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,840
blue dream y'all they grow like crazy

145
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,799
I'm talking in three and a half weeks I

146
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,399
got almost three foot of growth on some

147
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,360
them they're freaking crazy and that's

148
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,799
from seed bro I'm talking from when that

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,680
pops open that thing's up up harder and

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,639
stiffer than your boy but my thing is

151
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,879
here and this

152
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,680
thing this is one your branch is

153
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,399
sticking up it's sticking up with

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,519
another one going this way but for the

155
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,719
sake of the demonstration of visual

156
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,519
pretend we got two uh vertical branches

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,199
going up a little taller than the rest

158
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,959
of them or the rest of the plant and you

159
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,720
get all this really great growth down

160
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,719
here but there ain't no freaking light

161
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,960
to it so what you want to do these clips

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,560
are awesome cuz you can reuse them you

163
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,079
can wash them they're plastic I Ain a

164
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,800
big plastic fan but what I mean what

165
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,959
what are you going to do so you take

166
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,560
that first you take that wrench you tuck

167
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,399
it in there just like that and then you

168
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,959
want to make sure you ain't covering up

169
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,719
any nodes or anything so you want to get

170
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,038
a spot where you got some space to do

171
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,759
this is and then next thing you do you

172
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:02,439
take that that Branch God Dam take that

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,800
rest of that Brun and just slide it

174
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,360
right under like

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,199
that now all this growth popping out

176
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,960
here is going to go go out and then up

177
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,840
and then you going to have a real nice

178
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,560
canopy with a few seconds of work and

179
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,159
then what's cool about these is you know

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,160
two or three of these per plan will do

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,720
you do you good cuz you can go back in

182
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,120
there later that night or the next day

183
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,319
take that one off and and move it up or

184
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,840
move to another one then keep

185
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,800
keep working them I really love them

186

288
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,439

409
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,638

413
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,759

414
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,439

415
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,519
driver's seat and I'm in I old Monte

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,759
Carlo and he gets in the back and my

417
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,560
thought is is like dude this mother this

418
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,240
dude could let's just say he could mess

419
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,239
me up from being back here I can't even

420
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,360
hardly see him right so before he even

421
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,198
gets to the car I'm putting the the rear

422
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,000
re mirror so I can see back there you

423
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,479

424
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,679
and he was weird and the chick she was

425
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,120
all right she's kind of hot dude like in

426
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,798
a weird way you know like a country

427
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,639
weird way like down and dirty kind of

428
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:14,279
stuff like you know I probably would but

429
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,480
my point is she's like on the way out

430
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,480
there she's like talking about how our

431
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,160

432
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,240
kind of crazy too and there's a chance

433
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,679
he's going to meet me meet us at the end

434
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,558

584
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,000
good and and they you know that was just

585
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,119
a good sign usually if it had one

586
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,640
usually they want and done or they just

587
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,038
yeah I mean who really wants to get

588
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,919
stuck with the same [ __ ] like part of my

589
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,400
whole thing was having something new

590
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,278
every few days and and just having

591
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,480
something new and fresh every few days

592
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,679
so dude had a few different ones and he

593
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,200
he pulls them out in five gallon buckets

594
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,559
with lids on them which you know I've

595
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,200
seen people do it that way but he pulled

596
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:14,839
them out and dude this [ __ ] smelled so

597
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,278

terrible I I wish I could tell you the

602
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:33,320
prices

603
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,840
but let's just say uh pretty shitty bro

604
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,558
I didn't get ripped

605
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:39,918
off I ripped myself off really because I

606
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,278
could have said no but at this point

607
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,480
like I said this is all I had left so I

608
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:48,159

kind of like Bartered him down a little

611
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,000
bit on the price and I just went with a

612
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,558
smallest like amount I could get out of

613
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
