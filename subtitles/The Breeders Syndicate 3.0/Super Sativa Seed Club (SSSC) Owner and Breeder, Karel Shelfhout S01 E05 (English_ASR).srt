00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,420
welcome to breeder City game

4
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,160
so we're pretty excited today you know

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,980
we've been doing a lot of uh early

6
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,959
breeding talk uh trying to Source some

7
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,119
of the history of how we got to where we

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,340
are today we've talked about breeding

9
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,419
techniques we talked about a bunch of

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,460
early 80s and 90s seed banks we focused

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,460
on Neville quite a bit because he was

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,299
one of the largest seed banks in the 80s

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,640
and we're pretty excited today because

14
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:05,158
we have the other largest seed bank of

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,618
the 80s uh the super sativa seed club

16
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,200
which was next to Neville the biggest

17
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,319
seed bank in Holland at the time and

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,960
lots and lots of famous strains like

19
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,478
Williams Wonder and Beatrix choice and

20
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,359
things of that nature came out of their

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,700
seed bank and we're lucky in that the

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,280
founder is still alive and well and was

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,400
excited to talk to us so we want to

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,540
bring you a couple stage interview with

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Corel who is the owner and founder of

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,540
the super sativity seed club and we're

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,359
going to be asking him a lot of

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,219
questions about the 80s the style they

29
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,739
were doing things how he got certain

30
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,140
strains and really all the areas of

31
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,618
Interest we can think of so this is kind

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,719
of like the the second big piece to 80

33
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,599

00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,780
pretty excited so here it is prepare

35

okay okay take it easy man

45
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:27,479
I'm just a guy of Flesh and blues yeah

46
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,979
same here but it's it's really cool to

47
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,479
be able to have this opportunity to ask

48
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,878
you some some questions about the

49
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,199
history of sssc so where would you like

50
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,179
to start

51
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,699
yeah maybe

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,340
um yeah it's a long time ago already of

53
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:45,359
course and uh

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:48,360
1985 we started yes and and those days

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,900
yeah we were squatters and we we we were

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,599
like you are man really yeah we were

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,340
activists and

58
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,799
our idea was to

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,920
um yeah because in those days in Holland

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,939
it was not legal to grow yes but it was

61
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:08,039
like uh a little bit uh it was not it

62
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:12,419
was not a big deal to do it and not not

63
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,759
many people did it and um so um yeah we

64
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,199
started to grow and then actually

65
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,739
um we learned

66
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,560
about growing under uh mental health

67
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:27,259
life from people who went to the states

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,759
and they saw it there oh wow yeah

69
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:32,340
I work in those days in a coffee shop

70
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:36,239
and a friend of us he went to the states

71
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,939
and and and he saw how you guys did this

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,900
and nobody did in those days did this in

73
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:45,900
Holland and so um I thought yeah let's

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,959
give it a try and I think we were the

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,140
first to in Holland to to grow on the um

76
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,658
on the metal halites in those days it

77
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,779
was that's amazing yeah yeah and then so

78
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:59,938
uh we are we're looking to live close to

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,000
uh to the baker Horticulture Center was

80
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:05,158
hold on the Westland because the New

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Holland is really we are the number one

82
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,919
in the world in the Horticulture and

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,379
things yes so um yeah

84
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,780
we decided to to start this the only

85
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,599
problem we we had we didn't have any

86
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,519
seeds oh so how does how do you start

87
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,019
sourcing your seeds and your lines what

88
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,939
makes you choose what you do yeah

89
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,519
because the thing is in those days the

90
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,300
the Cannabis was only

91
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,719
um

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,020
from the tropical countries uh yes and

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,820
it was all seated with a lot of seeds so

94
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,198
if you tried those seats and Holland

95
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,240
they didn't

96
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
they didn't they didn't flower in time

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,918
because we are quite known and then

98
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,638
those the sativity are from the Ecuador

99
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:52,019
yeah and so we we didn't have a success

100
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,360
really not and but one of the guys he

101
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,399
went to the stage of one of our friends

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,540
because yeah we've been in the seats and

103
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,538
he went to

104
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,819
um to New York and he had to a certain

105
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:06,719
office I I better I don't call the name

106
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,819
because this is them yeah and then they

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,759
said no man we don't have seats and uh

108
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,978
but he he said yeah but I come from

109
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,500
Holland and I came specially to you to

110
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:18,599
to pick up some seats and after one week

111
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,478
they said okay okay okay we will give

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,240
you some seats and those were the

113
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:27,779
William Wonder seats so those came out

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,978
of New York yes that's fascinating yes

115
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:33,500
and uh so then we started to grow

116
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:37,139
those sheets and then we will be at

117
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,379
quite not a big success but a little bit

118
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,900
says and after a while the famous damn

119
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,879
the screenman you've heard from him of

120
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,839
course yeah and he came to live in

121
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,719
Holland and and he contacted he

122
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,060
contacted us because he thought when I

123
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,819
live in Holland I have to be in touch

124
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,459
with the with the seed guys absolutely

125
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:03,300
and those days where you had Neville

126
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:05,099
okay and we were the second one and so

127
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,220
there were basically two seed banks in

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,160
the world that's right he came to we

129
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,940
became in contact with him and he told

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,340
us

131
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,959
um yeah and I come here to live in

132
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,538
Holland but I don't have a place to grow

133
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,758
and maybe you can help me or whatever

134
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:23,759
yeah she said hey I have a nice

135
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,560
collection of seats because he did a lot

136
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,580
of breathing already in the stage yeah

137
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,959
and um

138
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:34,019
his number one thing was skunk number

139
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,538
one it was really the uh

140
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:40,198
yeah the first Variety in the world that

141
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:42,719
really somebody took the effort to um

142
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,538
to inbred it and to to to to to to to

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,780
make a selection out of a big group and

144
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:50,879
basically so we we were very happy with

145
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,159
those seats and and he had something

146
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,860
from his private stash as well and he

147
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,919
said this is my private thing

148
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,020
but there are only 20 seats left

149
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,758
uh so he

150
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,859
um

151
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,860
um yeah he gave us his feet and those

152
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,939
were the the hay seats

153
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,360
oh so he sold you some of the original

154
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,819
hay seeds yes yes so he had 20 seats and

155
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,919
he gave 10 to us and and he gave 10 to

156
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,520
to Neville so these words from the same

157
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,019
batch you're a Neville

158
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,299
there were already like 10 years old and

159
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,839
he said this is really we need to

160
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,978
germinate them because because and I

161
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,098
gave it to you because you understand

162
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:34,139
how to do it and yeah so we can save the

163
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,719
seeds and

164
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,418
um we were not really

165
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,759
um we try to haste but we did we did not

166
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,859
like it because it took too long to

167
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,720
flower and it was Freddy small birds and

168
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,098
at the same time we were very glad with

169
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,280
the screen over number one seeds because

170
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:54,300
we were used to the fluffy the

171
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:57,779
sustratives that were from

172
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,418
South Africa from Jamaica from Colombia

173
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:04,098
so we were really happy to see the big

174
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:07,139
birds of the school number one

175
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:10,439
really a lot of residents and a lot of

176
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,478
smell and but we decided to make a cross

177
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,319
between security number one and the uh

178
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:19,500
and one of the uh the agency we had left

179
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,460
and from this cross we made a big

180
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,759
selection and that's then we were very

181
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,799
happy to find a one with the correct

182
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,439
correct the the smell and the taste of

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,839
the age and and the bird structure of

184
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,139
the screen gram run so that was really

185
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,440
happy that we could grow hazes but yeah

186
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,179
and they take fat birds and the nice

187
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,060
thing about this I still have this plant

188
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,299
and it's now 35 years old

189
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:52,679
and we we still have it and it's it's

190
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:55,278
our Flagship thing of course and uh we

191
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,679
have now based a lot of our crosses on

192
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,139
we made it with this old school lasers

193
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,079
we call it and it smells like catfish

194
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,360
and it's really a dark

195
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,759
earthy taste but it's then it's a very

196
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,980
uplifting high and it's really uh

197
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,659
yeah it's a really nice plant and it's

198
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,060
very difficult to grow because if you

199
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,338
make a mistake if your room gets too hot

200
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:20,659
it starts to flower again and it's

201
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,660
really a matter of

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,580
um yeah it's it's it's a difficult thing

203
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,139
to do I can't believe that that's still

204
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,339
around that's amazing that's absolutely

205
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,899
and you're still using it in your

206
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,300
current breeding programs yeah yeah yeah

207
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,360
yeah yeah yeah

208
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,338
um we stopped with the superset diva sea

209
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,019
clip after about five years because it

210
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,060
was really too

211
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,459
it became a little bit too successful

212
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,838
yeah I know what you mean and in those

213
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,939
days it was really

214
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,500
um yeah I remember a bit afraid of

215
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,680
Ronald Reagan the War on Drugs was going

216
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,740
on we're really strong in those days so

217
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,859
basically we quit the super city of seed

218
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,500
Club but I I kept on growing and doing

219
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,440
uh

220
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,500
doing cannabis and all different ways

221
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,180
and I like three or four years ago my

222
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,458
two sons I have two sons they are

223
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,958
Growers as well said I let's do it again

224
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,719
man why don't you do it because

225
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,879
everybody knows you and yeah

226
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
some people think you are a legend so

227
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,700
well let's do it again so we started

228
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,919
again and uh and yeah there's no quite

229
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,800
successful and now in Holland we are

230
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:35,399
also getting a situation of

231
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,019
of legal growing because yeah and all

232
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,899
that we have also always been on the

233
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:43,078
Forefront of the of the growing sure but

234
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,720
but yeah we lost a little bit because

235
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,439
you guys are doing it very good of

236
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,620
course now in the in the states and uh

237
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:56,480
in the legal situation and a lot of

238
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:00,600
um in a lot of States so um

239
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,240
can't stay behind man because we are the

240
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,639
ones who

241
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,060
exactly thrilled out to do the Cannabis

242
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,480
thing yeah and now we are looking at we

243
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:16,099
started a Lobby in Holland

244
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:19,440
and and we we also try to

245
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,680
uh to change the law we basically wrote

246
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,200
a law together with the Dutch government

247
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:28,679
and now there is going to be a big

248
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,579
um like a trial and the the Dutch

249
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:35,578
government uh has

250
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:38,578
given out 10 permits to grow legal for

251
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:40,859
the Dutch coffee shops oh wow and we

252
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:44,159
were we were lucky to want one of the

253
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,220
permits because 150 people applied for

254
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,620
the pyramid I'm sure and only 10 permits

255
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,759
so

256
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:55,919
and uh like from from 150 people uh 100

257
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,319
didn't make it because the plan was not

258
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,500
good enough and yeah they were not

259
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,180
because you needed to to uh to comply in

260
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,940
a lot of rules because you need to know

261
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:08,399
about cannabis you need to have the

262
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,980
money you need to have to to grow on a

263
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,039
big scale you need good context with the

264
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,620
coffee shops and we all have this so

265
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,078
um now we are very happy because then we

266
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,360
can do our breathing really because we

267
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:25,319
have done the breathing all always in

268
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,139
the illegal yeah same here so you can

269
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,600
imagine that it's for us uh difficult

270
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,100
because we like to see it but it's also

271
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,899
a little bit difficult to see that

272
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,759
people like

273
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,860
um

274
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,139
exotic mic exotic genetics is really

275
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,778
they can they can work in the legal

276
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,360
situation now for over three four five

277
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:47,700
years and you can see the results and

278
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,100
yeah he has a lot of people making seed

279
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,879
for him everywhere all over so yeah yeah

280
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,040
yeah yeah and um yeah and then hold on

281
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,360
to me we still have the like the the

282
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:02,539
strange difficult strains to grow

283
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,240
with the special

284
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:09,179
profiles and yeah that's what we want to

285
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,879
offer uh something different because um

286
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,699
it's kooky it's cookies everywhere

287
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,559
nowadays I I surely hope you guys stick

288
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,180
with some of the base old stuff because

289
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,099
that's what we need nobody wants cookies

290
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,379
anymore over here everybody's tired of

291
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,420
cookies yeah really yeah because over

292
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,078
here it's still new yeah it's still new

293
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:31,620
over there right like it's yeah yeah

294
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:36,419
and and like a strange but also an a

295
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:40,259
comic situation in uh that um we we went

296
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:43,679
to the states to get the seeds then we

297
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:47,480
grow we did a lot of uh breathing and

298
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,338
things then we sold it back to the stage

299
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,639
and now

300
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:57,019
the states is doing very well and now we

301
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,019
have to go to the states again

302
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:04,078
in that situation because we have

303
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,838
everything over here and and you don't

304
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,519
have to fly out to get it you understand

305
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,639
that so that's good that's nice that

306
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,919
it's going uh all over the world and the

307
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,320
idea of the super sativa seed clip was

308
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,500
because we were very politically

309
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,579
involved with our idea to

310
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,980
um

311
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:25,859
yeah to help the state is a little bit

312
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,220
it's strange to save but we were in this

313
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:32,100
position that we could do uh

314
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,560
Sami legal or things and in those days

315
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,139
you had a lot of people coming back from

316
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,179
Vietnam those were our clients you know

317
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,879
because they they ordered the cheese

318
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,819
from us and they they were the ones who

319
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,759
really uh did a lot of gorilla farming

320
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,379
and and and in California where it's

321
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,278
still going in the same place but it's

322
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:56,820
now we'll go it happened so uh rld was

323
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,220
when when we sell the seeds to a lot of

324
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,579
different people in the in the US

325
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,759
there will be a lot of different a lot

326
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:08,939
of refrigerated

327
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:11,879
refrigerators stocked with seeds so for

328
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,980
the government it's quite difficult to

329
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,659
stop this you know because yeah it's

330
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,820
spreading everywhere and and in those

331
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,759
days you didn't have the internet and

332
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,278
it's if you live in a certain city okay

333
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,338
you can spread the seeds

334
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,600
give this to your friends yeah it's a

335
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,180
bit difficult when you live in

336
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,139
California to to to to make sure that

337
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,138
also the people in

338
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:41,338
so we our idea was to to spread it

339
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:44,278
everywhere with the ID this is not going

340
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,240
to stop anymore then yeah that's it's a

341
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,338
beautiful idea it's like Johnny

342
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,740
Appleseed modern day Danny Johnny

343
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,779
Appleseed yeah and also we did we were

344
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,299
not in for the money because we we did

345
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:56,458
we we really were in for the love of the

346
00:15:54,299 --> 00:16:00,059
plants and we still are and of course

347
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:03,119
the money was nice but uh because the

348
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:06,119
our business uh model was a little bit

349
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,459
strange because people from the states I

350
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,360
understand people money to to Holland

351
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:15,059
yeah without knowing who who we are oh

352
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,459
sure sure and then and then they had to

353
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:20,099
trust us that we sent the seats back to

354
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:22,439
them absolutely and the first few years

355
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,620
people were a little bit reluctant to

356
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:30,300
Santa's uh money because of course maybe

357
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:33,060
who are we nobody knew yeah and so at

358
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:35,399
one point people from High Times They

359
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:39,119
Came to to came to interview us because

360
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,100
we render and and High Times and they

361
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,698
thought oh man this is really

362
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,120
um

363
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:46,979
this is this is for Real yes so they

364
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,120
make it they made a nice cover story

365
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,820
about this from those days it's really

366
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,778
yeah it really exploded you know yeah

367
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,560
yeah and then we got we got we got like

368
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,500
um

369
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,059
people from all the from everywhere in

370
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,919
the world ordering sheets and we don't

371
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,159
uh this is really getting too big and

372
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,959
equipment is because

373
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,079
it was getting a little bit out of hands

374
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,660
yeah yeah it got a little hot because in

375
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,459
a lot of people

376
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,439
from Japan from Australia from Canada

377
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,600
from everybody start to order seeds

378
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,100
because it was really the first we

379
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,480
really were the first ones to do this

380
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:30,119
and yeah so it was a big uh big success

381
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,579
and we were

382
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:36,000
Robert Como Clark you know him as well I

383
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:38,339
think oh yes he told her also always the

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,500
wisest thing you did discreet with this

385
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,359
yeah we saw what happened with Neville

386
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,839
we saw what happened it ruined his life

387
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,058
yeah yeah yeah so so it's really uh and

388
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,918
now um

389
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:52,139
yeah we're still going strong and we are

390
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,100
still loving the plants and we we are

391
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,900
still very happy to um

392
00:17:55,099 --> 00:18:02,038
to make combinations with the new things

393
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,200
from the states with our old stuff and a

394
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,538
lot of things turned out very well

395
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,179
because we like to have

396
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:12,599
we like the layered taste you know oh

397
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:16,620
yeah if we do something with Haze we

398
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:20,038
will be we can keep the the haste taste

399
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,139
but also we can combine it with uh like

400
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:26,339
gorilla glue or whatever and it makes it

401
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:28,320
really a a thing that we like that it's

402
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:32,879
not one taste but a lot of different

403
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:35,038
taste is in one variety and

404
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,740
um yeah and and we are not so afraid of

405
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,379
doing things like uh 12 weeks of

406
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,880
flowering and because yeah a lot of

407
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,960
people are afraid to do this and they

408
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,720
are

409
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,480
it's difficult but it's really worth

410
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,038
waiting a few weeks actually Americans

411
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,660
are finally

412
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,940
um being more receptive to Long

413
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,980
flowering strains as of the past maybe

414
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,600
two or three years I've noticed hazes

415
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,339
are finally starting to pick up in the

416
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,918
U.S whereas they were never a staple

417
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:05,220
here except in in Santa Cruz in the you

418
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,259
know late 60s early 70s mid 70s but

419
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,240
nowadays people want that they want a

420
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:14,220
little bit of that that trippy Colombian

421
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,380
and yeah yeah because we also we work

422
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,179
together with age seeds as well do you

423
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,700
know Asia oh yeah oh yeah

424
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,900
yeah that's what these are our friends

425
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,880
as well and they're a really good

426
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,980
company they have they I really have

427
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,340
like uh these

428
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,940
super strong that's sativas and and and

429
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:35,519
now like in an um in the legal situation

430
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,919
in in the US I do not understand why

431
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,480
people are afraid to from a longer

432
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,919
flowery time because if you have the

433
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,660
space to do this

434
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,600
yeah I can imagine in the illegal

435
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,620
situation when you don't have much space

436
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,019
it's a bit

437
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,178
um yeah of course and I can imagine that

438
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:54,179
you you want to speed up things a little

439
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,640
bit but but what I have seen always is

440
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,538
uh it takes four weeks longer to to

441
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,679
finish

442
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:04,319
but but the yield and get there

443
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,620
30 40 more yeah so at the end of the day

444
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,779
your results are exactly the same as

445
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:12,859
when you grow short flowering varieties

446
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,960
sure because the big the the the the the

447
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:18,899
what we and how long to always say the

448
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,900
the modern American strange they lack

449
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,900
wait

450
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,240
yeah yeah absolutely that's why we try

451
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,659
to make roses with the new American

452
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,740
strains to to to to get to make plans

453
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:37,140
with the big reels yes because sativas

454
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,620
you know how they how they flower the

455
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,620
the the the the birds are arm length and

456
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,959
yes and then the the cookies you have a

457
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,219
birth

458
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,919
you don't have anything another bird

459
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,440
it's nice but it doesn't bring weight in

460
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,659
the scale yeah no there's cookies is

461
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,400
very low yielding and yeah the high

462
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,440
doesn't last too long either so a good

463
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
Haze hybrid with the cookies would be

464
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,038
awesome you know bring a much better

465
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,500
height of cookies that isn't there yeah

466
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,058
yeah yeah yeah

467
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,159
so I have some questions for you

468
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:10,079
um do you have a lot of good um a good

469
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
memory for like where you sourced

470
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,139
certain things or the history of certain

471
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:17,220
strains that you put out no no no no no

472
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,960
no no that's a bit of a problem because

473
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,839
um the old school has

474
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,000
um the Clone we still have and I'm in

475
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,619
touch with in Canadia a lot of people

476
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,519
they still have the free slam the Indica

477
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:32,459
yeah yes yes but it was very famous

478
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:35,639
almost people told me that a lot of

479
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,860
people from 50 60 years old now that

480
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,140
they started when they started to to

481
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:42,418
smoke they all started with free slam

482
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,580
Indica it was over there it was really

483
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:50,580
uh a big thing yeah now um today I

484
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:53,519
talked with somebody from Canada and he

485
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:56,099
he knows a guy in the US who still has

486
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,900
the Beatrix Jewish and

487
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:01,558
um

488
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:04,080
m33 and the the thing is in in so many

489
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:06,298
years a lot of things happened so to be

490
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:10,859
honest I lost a little bit track of

491
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:14,639
where everything is now yeah and and in

492
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:18,719
those days we'll be basically uh the

493
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,840
families he provided us with seats and a

494
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,120
lot of sheets we we just took from um

495
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,519
from the backs of weed that we that we

496
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:30,899
yeah that we bought in the coffee shops

497
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:32,460
and and in those days oh but we were we

498
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,280
had to go fish in Amsterdam we had the

499
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,038
coffee shop it was called Durban Poison

500
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:41,220
yes and they only sold

501
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:43,259
um cannabis from South Africa yes so we

502
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,779
made a lot of crosses with the Durban

503
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,400
Poison because it's this South African

504
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:49,558
is also

505
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,500
it's part of the South and the world so

506
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:55,019
the flowering period is more or less the

507
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,640
same as we have in Holland yeah so this

508
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,900
was very nice to make roses between

509
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,820
screen number one uh German poison and

510
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,880
then we and then we gave it a nice name

511
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:08,700
and it was like our variety and it was

512
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,419
not a big deal because it was really

513
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,058
um

514
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,600
we took the seeds from the backs and we

515
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:17,220
grew them and we pollinated the the one

516
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,319
that we like best

517
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,380
and we had a new variety because in

518
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:25,019
those days it was not really

519
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,260
inbredding yeah we did not really do

520
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,538
that because to be honest the demand for

521
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,220
our seeds were so big that we even

522
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:34,980
didn't have time to do this you know oh

523
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,000
I bet yeah I understand that

524
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:41,159
yeah so um yeah one thing that's been

525
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,720
happening in the U.S the past maybe 15

526
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,299
years since I've been around I've

527
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,298
noticed there is a um and this this is

528
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:50,038
unfortunate uh seriously unfortunate but

529
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:51,599
every two or three years someone will

530
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,359
come up and pretend to have a big

531
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,399
collection of old sssc stuff yeah and

532
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,839
then sell it it's all fake you know yeah

533
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,460
it just happened to Beatrix Choice

534
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,418
someone just popped up with fake Beatrix

535
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,340
Choice that's probably what you're

536
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,380
referring to yeah that's not anyone's

537
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,278
collections over here you know who

538
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,960
Beatrix is yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah we

539
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,740
we've studied your strains for so many

540
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,179
years

541
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,038
um the Williams Wonder clone is still

542
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,100
out here that that colony is still

543
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,058
available yeah there's still seeds every

544
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,359
once in a while you'll find Williams

545
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:24,720
Wonder seeds that are pure okay nice and

546
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,859
39 still around still around so it's a

547
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,798
famous one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

548
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:32,459
because in the in Canada I went to visit

549
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:34,918
Canada and then the guy he get he he

550
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,940
showed me the freeze land indigo

551
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,860
then I was really like

552
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,558
there is of course a lot of things

553
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,839
happened or in all those years and the

554
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:49,678
ability is becoming better and better

555
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:53,519
and it's of course I was not really

556
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:57,298
um very proud to see the the fridge I

557
00:24:53,519 --> 00:25:00,179
thought this is not really but we like

558
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:03,778
those days and these days you know yes

559
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,640
but I think it's more special are the

560
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:09,058
Hastings because the age is really

561
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,159
something uh something different and and

562
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:14,940
it's also um

563
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:17,580
for me as the owner of this super city

564
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,278
of sea Club it's sometimes funny that

565
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,918
people tell me things that I myself even

566
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:25,859
don't know you know yeah I'm sure yeah

567
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,020
you can imagine that um

568
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,839
because he had a lot of different

569
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,240
varieties and yeah for us it's different

570
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,939
than than for for the collectors you

571
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,460
know oh sure yeah it's really uh but I

572
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,360
really like it to her that a lot of

573
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,400
people are still trying to find the

574
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:48,719
roots from Cannabis you know because

575
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:52,140
it's basically it's basically uh even a

576
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,319
never he of course did a bit more than

577
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,080
we did and and because he was really the

578
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,658
first one and he yeah we were the second

579
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,599
ones and it's all

580
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:06,900
that's all for uh Neville he he's not

581
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,579
anymore with us anymore you know yeah I

582
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,059
was friends with him yeah yeah yeah yeah

583
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:14,579
so it was in there yeah but then the

584
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:17,339
nice thing is also that we we we got

585
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:21,119
some uh of his last work in Clone form

586
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:23,579
okay yeah we have the Outback Hayes okay

587
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,399
that's the one he made in Australia when

588
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,798
he lived in Australia yeah kingativa Ian

589
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,419
made all those for him oh yeah I don't

590
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,440
know yeah yeah he's one of my good

591
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,960
friends we were all working together

592
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,640
during that time ah okay okay yeah yeah

593
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,519
yeah and then we also could have a h g

594
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,840
oh nice yeah yeah and that's how and we

595
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:48,119
have also the nl5 times Haze oh good the

596
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:52,019
the the the the real the Clone that he

597
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:53,579
uh he selected him from a lot of plants

598
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,759
I really don't know oh oh so like there

599
00:26:53,579 --> 00:27:00,418
is I think it's the A5 or C5 A5 no no no

600
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,460
no no no the A5 and the C5 we also have

601
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,120
oh do you have those two yeah yeah yeah

602
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,120
but because

603
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
um

604
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,740
there's a group of people uh yeah who

605
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,360
still have all those things and then

606
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,359
they um

607
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,119
yeah and and then in the haste world

608
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,158
it's still a little bit

609
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:25,739
nobody owns this you know yeah of course

610
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:30,899
yeah people think they do do you think

611
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:32,099
they do this is like uh we are like uh

612
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:35,639
um

613
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:38,699
uh activists you know we think uh I I

614
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,120
don't believe in owning screens and

615
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,220
ownings absolutely I agree not everybody

616
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,398
agrees with this but uh no not everybody

617
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,759
does agree with that um

618
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:53,339
of course uh when somebody puts a lot of

619
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,980
effort in in breathing a strain or

620
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,980
working a strain like many years then he

621
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,038
can then I consider it that he owns it

622
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,019
yeah correct if if it's long bred and

623
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,819
selected and a lot of work put into it

624
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:08,879
right now Gorilla Glue is going after

625
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:12,778
everyone yeah and also at the point when

626
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,559
somebody is selling in the seat uh Bank

627
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,740
a regular seat yeah then I own it as

628
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,740
well

629
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:25,440
you're buying the genetics right yeah

630
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,240
because and if you don't want to sell

631
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,580
the genetics you have to feminize it or

632
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,740
whatever and even then I mean if someone

633
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,879
feminizes your your feminized seeds then

634
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,759
you're just that [ __ ] out of luck

635
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,100
because you've sold it yeah yeah yeah so

636
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,579
so I'm not really busy and protecting

637
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:44,879
the genetics and uh sure and then and

638
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:49,019
maybe uh because I also want to ask your

639
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,600
questions of course yeah because do you

640
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:54,119
think do we see things happening in the

641
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,199
states like that people are trying to

642
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,199
protect

643
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,600
strains or genetics yeah people are

644
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,679
trying to patent feminization techniques

645
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,959
that they had nothing to do with

646
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,179
creating people are trying to patch

647
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,659
strains as quickly as they can trademark

648
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,519
strain names like doji Kush but but

649
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,340
names it's a different thing because

650
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,679
yeah but the plant varieties we can't

651
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:18,240
patent them yet but there are many

652
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,980
people at the Forefront of that trying

653
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,880
to get it the second that it uh happens

654
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,480
and it'll be a problem it'll definitely

655
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,520
what are they trying to do then because

656
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,079
and hold on do you have like um

657
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,259
yeah because we have a lot of

658
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:37,319
horticulture flowers and everything you

659
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:40,379
can you can patent if you can you can

660
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,480
own this train as long as it's as it is

661
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,480
different in a lot of expects than any

662
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,339
other screen sure and the second thing

663
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,480
you have to do you have to be able to

664
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:53,819
reproduce it and that means if you have

665
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,339
100 seats of the strain all the plants

666
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:59,278
have to be the same uniform so an IBL

667
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:01,918
perform and also and the next time you

668
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,140
show them they have to be the same again

669
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,899
yeah I don't think anyone in the U.S

670
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,080
except for maybe CSI Humboldt and a few

671
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:11,519
others uh uh 707 seed bank there's only

672
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,558
probably two or three people who are

673
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,839
capable of uh even producing seed lines

674
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:16,918
like that let alone so I think many

675
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,720
people are really going to be getting

676
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,100
the patents there's some uh breeders up

677
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,240
in BC that have been doing it very

678
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,158
seriously and big for a long time

679
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,899
that'll probably

680
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,059
um be looking for that in their country

681
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:29,099
because to give you an example if you

682
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,500
were like you know how long do you have

683
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:33,240
a lot of big seed companies tomato seeds

684
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,519
and everything yeah yeah and if you if

685
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,159
you buy a kilo tomato seeds you're

686
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,480
buying 50 000 seats and if you grow

687
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,539
those 50 000 plants they are all 100 the

688
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,339
same yeah uniform

689
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:49,798
and there is not one marijuana strain

690
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,720
around that it's uniform you know no

691
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,980
it's and and I don't know that marijuana

692
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,120
can be

693
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,419
um brought to uniformity because

694
00:30:54,119 --> 00:31:01,259
environment takes such a a big factor in

695
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:04,440
in expression and also of course because

696
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:08,700
of the military multi multiple hybrids

697
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,460
exactly I I know for sure that in the

698
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,278
cookies there is something from us oh

699
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,200
yeah I guarantee it and and for sure

700
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:18,319
there is some screen number one in it

701
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,319
yeah the step the screenman always told

702
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,720
me everything but I think we know

703
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,359
exactly what cookies is now it's very

704
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,519
it's it's a simple simple little um

705
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,719
thing but to break it down to its base

706
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,440
components it's going to be something

707
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,600
like skunk one Afghani one yeah and I

708
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,720
like that I really like it the the smell

709
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,058
and The Taste and I really uh want to

710
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,860
say and good work but guys who did to

711
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:45,720
the guys who did it yeah it was an

712
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:49,619
accident but this is of course difficult

713
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,600
to make this uniform because yeah in in

714
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,538
the cookies let's say the cookies there

715
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,480
are maybe like 25 different varieties oh

716
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:59,220
yeah easy easy for sure yeah and those

717
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,339
were like the screen number one is all

718
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,298
is already those who already have like

719
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,658
five

720
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:08,278
yeah the varieties in it yes and then

721
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,700
you bring in more parents with all their

722
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:15,000
backgrounds and grandparents

723
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:18,179
the hybridization is like

724
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,359
there are one million swings yeah I

725
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,940
think exactly I try to keep it to the in

726
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,240
my work I like to keep it to a baseline

727
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,220
like a base Afghani or a base something

728
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,740
like that you know and cross it too it

729
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,839
may be a poly hybrid so it brings that

730
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,720
down dramatically you know like it's

731
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,298
easier to breed yeah and line breed from

732
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,558
it and select and at the super sativity

733
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:44,480
we are not really uh the body putting a

734
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:46,259
lot of

735
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,179
efforts in

736
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,658
um and and breathing and everything

737
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,659
because sure what we like is um when I

738
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,799
buy seeds I like to do final hunting

739
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:01,200
yeah and final hunting

740
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:03,480
uh yeah that's that's the nice thing

741
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,640
when we make a cross with with our age

742
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,620
then you will find a lot of different

743
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,259
things and one of the plants is really

744
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:13,739
something special you know oh sure and

745
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:17,480
that's right that's what what I like and

746
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,480
the the big LPS did

747
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,240
they try to sell to buy seeds and then

748
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:26,759
they think then we have a uniform group

749
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,278
but I always tell them please man do

750
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,079
female ending and I look for a nice

751
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,019
mother and go from there

752
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,460
yeah because I have a I have a quick

753
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,558
question for you

754
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,298
um there's been some myths and stories

755
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,918
over the years one of the stories that

756
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:45,538
came up recently and someone made a seed

757
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:48,360
company off of was uh saying that they

758
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:51,419
were breeding for you in Virginia to

759
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,918
make your skunk one no that's not true

760
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,600
that's not true I didn't think it was

761
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,360
true but I had to ask because it's a lot

762
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,579
of people

763
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:02,339
he made the screen number one and he

764
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,558
made he made it in California and he was

765
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:07,678
really the first guy in the world to uh

766
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,699
to to to grow in a big greenhouse and to

767
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,440
do really

768
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,199
um to do real

769
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,480
um breathing you know yeah and then

770
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,759
basically the the screen grammar one the

771
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,418
original one is

772
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
um

773
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:24,598
there are basically two phenotypes one

774
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,338
with the pointed uh one bit around it

775
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,480
and the smell in the days they were all

776
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:33,599
uh really quite uniform sure and that

777
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,019
was his work and uh in Holland in those

778
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:41,359
days uh all the breathing

779
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:41,358
was done with screen number one because

780
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:50,159
and it was really uh it's it's good

781
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,699
number one in the 80s and the 90s was in

782
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,700
every planet

783
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,820
um can we ask you the history on Beatrix

784
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:58,199
choice because again you brought it up

785
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,720
earlier and it's one that people liked

786
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,480
is there a certain history on it no no

787
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,219
really the the only thing is to be

788
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,240
honest I really I even don't remember

789
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:12,239
the uh it's been a long time yeah yeah

790
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:15,659
the cross that we make that we made the

791
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:18,299
only thing is that we remember we why we

792
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:20,098
put the name on it that that that's what

793
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,440
what was the name from

794
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,920
yeah because it's Beatrix is the queen

795
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,960
of Holland yes and so we thought uh in

796
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,240
those days like you like your T-shirt

797
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,400
man we were yeah we were like this and

798
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,319
that was those days and we had one

799
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,420
Victor Barn do you know Victor Barn

800
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,180
Victor Barn yeah yeah that's a nice

801
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,760
story to tell because in those days

802
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:45,118
um we had enroll on the Lockheed Affair

803
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,820
and the Lockheed that was like the

804
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,760
company who who built airplanes oh lucky

805
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,599
yeah yeah yeah and the Lockheed so our

806
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,599
the the

807
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,579
um the husband of our Queen was Prince

808
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:02,159
Bernard and he was he was like a naughty

809
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,780
guy he was doing he had a lot of

810
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,420
different wives and he was doing a lot

811
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,119
of different things and and he he made

812
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,280
he made a deal with the Lockheed and he

813
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,660
said I will make sure that the Dutch

814
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,040
government is going to buy your

815
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:16,440
airplanes

816
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:20,159
okay you have to pay me 10 million

817
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:23,159
dollars for this and look he did he did

818
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,980
that that has this this Prince better

819
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:28,699
not had to use a fake name to open a

820
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:32,159

825
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,598
was like uh

826
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,358
a little bit like this with them you

827
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,539

828
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,639
can't grow a weed are you doing the this

829
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,279
kind of things yeah

830
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,319
yeah yeah yeah I am very I'm I'm very

831
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,160
politically active here

832
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,260
um

833
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,578
our government is very especially in

834
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,619
California certain areas of California

835
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,760
are still very illegal like a lot of

836
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,039
people don't know that like they think

837
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,300
California they think legal State

838
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,179
um I'm in a part of California that's

839
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,880
the Bible Belt so despite any laws our

840
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:13,739
county has overridden the laws and if

841
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,420
you get caught growing you're [ __ ] you

842
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:17,159
go to the [ __ ] jail you're done you

843
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,858
know so we're still very politically

844
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,118
active here trying to fight uh a lot of

845
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:23,098
that and everything's still done very

846
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,119
clandestine Black Market in most of the

847
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:29,940
uh States okay yeah yeah I know it I

848
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,700
know I know I I'm very good friends with

849
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,679
the people for humble seats oh yeah and

850
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:37,379
they always tell me everybody thinks

851
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:40,019
it's legal but still it's it's not legal

852
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,838
at all yeah it's scary scary in some

853
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:44,579
places yeah yeah so now for me the

854
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,039
circle is a little bit run because I

855
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:50,579
started this thing more or less and now

856
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,739
I'm very happy that I'm part of the

857
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,019
group that go to permit to grow legal in

858
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:57,389
Holland you know yeah for me it's like

859
00:37:55,019 --> 00:38:07,719
uh the circle is around

860
00:37:57,389 --> 00:38:07,719
[Music]

861
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:18,139
all right so what you just saw there was

862
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,539
you saw the first part of our interview

863
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:24,299
with Corel from Super sativa seed Club

864
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:27,059
Matt I wasn't unable to make it so Matt

865
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,160
did the first one we had a series of

866
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,139
follow-up questions and ideas and so

867
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,719
Corel was kind enough to come back and

868
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:36,539
chat with us again it's possible this

869
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,459
might be ongoing but for now we have a

870
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,800
two-part Series so the first was Matt

871
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,019
the second will be primarily me although

872
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,579
Matt might be in it for a minute and

873
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:46,500
after that we'll have some commentary

874
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,380
where we talk about what we learned and

875
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,380
what we were excited about hearing

876
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,380
foreign

877
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:02,099
you know we read the we read the

878
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,920
catalogs we talk and talk about various

879
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:08,280
things but we're all a little younger to

880
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,920
have actually experienced like basically

881
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,599
you and the seed bank kind of starting

882
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,639
off like yeah yeah yeah oh this one okay

883
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,740
that's kind of like you know you you and

884
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,719
Neville at the seed bank you you two

885
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:25,559
kind of started off what we consider to

886
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:28,319
be like the modern seed era right like

887
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:31,440
before you uh

888
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,338
we were really curious as to like

889
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,338
certain questions you know for instance

890
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,960
um you know you you mentioned before uh

891
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:42,000
when did you when did you first start

892
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,760
seeing like Americans come in and

893
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,940
bringing their seed lines like skunk one

894
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,040
and and the Durbin or Afghani one or

895
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,358
these different things

896
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,139
yes

897
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:53,098
um

898
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:58,078
um

899
00:39:53,099 --> 00:40:01,160
we started in 85 and um

900
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,720
yeah yeah after one year or so the

901
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,980
seventh Kingman he came to Holland to to

902
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,519
live in Holland

903
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,338
and uh yeah he he wrote us a letter

904
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,440
because we were burning an ad an

905
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:16,440
advertisement in uh in High Times

906
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,260
magazine the Neville and the seed bank

907
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,838
did it as well so Sam told that when I

908
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:25,140
go to Holland I let's hook up with those

909
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,239
two guys and uh let's talk about cheats

910
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:31,318
and uh

911
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:33,838
I told them I met last time and then

912
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:37,500
those days we didn't have much feet the

913
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,358
only seats we have were from uh come

914
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,420
back from that we bought at the coffee

915
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,598
shops and it was all uh

916
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:48,119
sativas and so basically

917
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,440
um Sam the straight man brought all the

918
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:55,980
seats from the US to Amsterdam and of

919
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,000
course the the next one was Robert Clark

920
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:03,300
a friend of Sam's Green Man and after

921
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,300
that a few more came and the the the

922
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,119
nice thing about it is that the seeds

923
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,640
came from the the US to Amsterdam

924
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,880
then we started to send it to the US

925
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:17,940
again

926
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:20,519
and now it's again that we look into the

927
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,579
U.S to buy seats again from from you

928
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:26,579
guys

929
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:27,800
we were first more liberal than humor

930
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,900
because

931
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,119
in 85

932
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:36,358
it never has been illegal that will uh

933
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,800
in Holland but in 85 in those in the

934
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:41,219
beginning

935
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:45,420
not a lot of people they knew about uh

936
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:47,279
cannabis and they so basically we have

937
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,519
we could do what we want because nobody

938
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,339
knew about it and nobody uh even the

939
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,619
police didn't really take

940
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,960
um they left they let us do what we

941
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,599
wanted to do you know it's it's a and an

942
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,880
Amsterdam there were a few more we're

943
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,700
not burning of course he was really the

944
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,180
first one with the seed bank but he he

945
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:12,779
didn't respond it's International it was

946
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:17,399
only for Holland and he was really um

947
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:20,460
yeah he's older than me as well and he

948
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,519
um yeah he he also started to put the

949
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,659
coffee shop which is the first girl shop

950
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:29,460
is it the positronics

951
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:33,598
and then the coffee shop is the Mellow

952
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:36,240
Yellow and he's still around he

953
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,460
um he invented model that um not the

954
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:42,618
Rick Simpson Oil but then

955
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:45,420
yeah I I don't know he calls it

956
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:47,099
mediter and

957
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,599
um yeah he has a good

958
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,500
um he really there's a lot of good work

959
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,838
because

960
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,940
um he basically introduced to the Dutch

961
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,519
patients how to make your own oil that's

962
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,760
awesome he wants to teach the people uh

963
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:05,159
how to do it he wants that everybody's

964
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,500
an independent and independent from

965
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,199
Pharmaceuticals you need to make your

966
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,780
own medicine and I fully agree with it

967
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,399
yes so I think it really

968
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,040
um

969
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,818
he's still around and come back to the

970
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,480
question

971
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:20,519
um

972
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,920
Sam just kidding man he's nearly the man

973
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,199
who brought everything to uh Amsterdam

974
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,420
really yeah did you have any

975
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,139
interactions with uh Keys Hawker from

976
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:34,639
Loveland seeds no no no

977
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:39,420
he's older already yeah yeah no no no no

978
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:42,719
because the thing is um they um they try

979
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,300
to uh to push the as we call it the

980
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,358
native basically growing your own

981
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,660
backyard and we were more

982
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:54,539
um we thought uh is to call them the

983
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:57,598
rainy and the wet and let's go indoors

984
00:43:54,539 --> 00:44:02,000
because we we saw it yeah we saw it

985
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:04,559
happening in the US and we were um

986
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,440
we were readers of High Times magazine

987
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,920
yeah we were lucky enough to have an uh

988
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,380
the American bookstore in The Hague so

989
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,858
we went there every month to to buy the

990
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:19,920
the newest copies

991
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:22,980
we were sure what what in America was

992
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,818
going on and yeah yeah that's more or

993
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,800
less how we started for us skunk one and

994
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:30,599
Haze and and those type of things are

995
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,420
very very famous strains and they kind

996
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,980
of became like the backbone of what you

997
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,079
guys were doing over there for a while

998
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,358
yeah what was it like to grow those

999
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,339
things at first we were very happy

1000
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,179
especially with the screen number one

1001
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:45,179
because

1002
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:49,799
um they were not used to see this kind

1003
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:50,699
of big butts and uh yeah stable genetics

1004
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,359
because

1005
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:53,358
um

1006
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,699
yeah you can imagine if you grow

1007
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:59,039
outdoors

1008
00:44:55,699 --> 00:45:01,559
sativa strained from the Ecuador

1009
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,900
yeah it doesn't flour the flowers in

1010
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,179
this in December and in December it's

1011
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,559
cold and rain and snow so we didn't see

1012
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:13,618
we we never ever had seen even Birds you

1013
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,338
know yeah so uh this was a big game

1014
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,140
changer when he came with his uh stuff

1015
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:22,799
and especially uh the student number one

1016
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:24,719
and the haze he gave us 10 seats in the

1017
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,300
lost city he stayed from his favorite

1018
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,399
variety and he gave the other 10 seeds

1019
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,180
to Neville and

1020
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,280
um

1021
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:34,799
yeah we didn't pay too much attention to

1022
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,680
the haze because it was long flowering

1023
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,539
and only very very small bits and it was

1024
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,460
really we were so happy with the screen

1025
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:43,639
number one that we almost forgot about

1026
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,440
the haze

1027
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:49,259
luckily enough we made crosses between

1028
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,280
School number one and Haze yeah and

1029
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:55,920
because we had 10 plants and and

1030
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,540
yeah two or two times we were arrested

1031
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,119
by the police and they took all our

1032
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:02,639
races and we we had only one left I even

1033
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:06,000
don't know anymore if it was if it was a

1034
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,679
boy or a girl but oh man he already made

1035
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,039
the seats with

1036
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:14,239
um the screen number one and I I still

1037
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:17,818
have a lot of sheets

1038
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:20,000
that we went between crosses between our

1039
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:22,500
10 Aces

1040
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,139
I try to germinate it and it really

1041
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,960
doesn't work anymore

1042
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:31,618
the problem was I I I kept them outside

1043
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:34,380
the refrigerator for 10 years yeah I put

1044
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:37,740
them in the refrigerator and I know I

1045
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,920
still have them so maybe some of your

1046
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:44,399
listeners yeah teaching culture because

1047
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:47,960
uh in my opinion uh the seat where there

1048
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:52,380
is only one cell alive still yeah

1049
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,358
basically you could reproduce it but if

1050
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,900
the government I don't think they want

1051
00:46:54,358 --> 00:47:01,019
to help us with this one yeah yeah if

1052
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:04,619
they find in a seat of wheat in a

1053
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:06,838
pyramid in in Egypt yeah they'll make

1054
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:10,559
sure that it's going to work again oh

1055
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:12,719
yeah but with cannabis seeds I still we

1056
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,838
still have to find somebody who can help

1057
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,699
us because I think the you know you know

1058
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,578
what I mean oh yeah tissue cultures

1059
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:22,858
teach them alive somewhere in those

1060
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:25,440
seats still and of course it would be

1061
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:27,500
nice to germinate it I gave it to a few

1062
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,818
people

1063
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,818
we will manage because I know how to do

1064
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:34,199
it yeah yeah

1065
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:37,019
of course yeah

1066
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:39,779
yeah but that's a Pity of course and to

1067
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:41,880
come back to your German poison I don't

1068
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,500
know yeah in those days we had an

1069
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,980
Amsterdam a coffee shop it was called

1070
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:50,940
the golden poison and oh yeah the only

1071
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,318
thing they sold was a wheat from South

1072
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,358
Africa

1073
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,880
I don't remember the names anymore but

1074
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:59,338
uh the the the the the the the major

1075
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,559
thing they solved with Urban Poison and

1076
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:04,500
that's also why we we had quite a few

1077
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,500
crosses in our first catalog with their

1078
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,900
poison because we both see we both read

1079
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,940
from them

1080
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,440
and together with string number one all

1081
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,900
the questions all the crosses with

1082
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,858
screen number one

1083
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:23,579
gave us more early flowering

1084
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:24,239
and a nice smell so it was basically

1085
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,740
um

1086
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,699
a winner combinations

1087
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:31,919
number one

1088
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,838
well do you remember what any of the um

1089
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,159
smell profiles of the different number

1090
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,199
ones that you popped back in the day

1091
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:40,199
were like yeah there's good number one

1092
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:43,259
was really uh like the names uh the name

1093
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:44,399
Tales at all it stinks like spoon oh so

1094
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,319
back then it actually smelled like

1095
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,260
skunks like North America yeah I I

1096
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,380
really to be honest I never have smelled

1097
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:55,200
it it's been getting milk but

1098
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,818
it was more about the the that it was so

1099
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,838
strong it was really strong you know

1100
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,199
yeah

1101
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,338
um in my uh that I have you can still

1102
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,578
smell

1103
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:07,558
in the back you smell the uh the screen

1104
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,720
the the the strong smell of the screen

1105
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,640
number one yeah and then together with

1106
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,259
this with the with the Asian today it

1107
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,618
gives you like

1108
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,420
there's a lot the the old school is very

1109
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,099
fully planned because if you make an

1110
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,099
analyze of it

1111
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:26,039
there is all there's only a perfume

1112
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:28,920
that's the only Turpin that's in it yeah

1113
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:31,739
and not too much as well but if you

1114
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,099
smoke it it's really Disturbed smell and

1115
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:39,358
taste that I have ever seen and wheat so

1116
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:41,338
yeah that's a big mystery and and I know

1117
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,759
it's about Philippines how is it

1118
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:47,099
possible that the plant with only one

1119
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,920
and not a lot of it can smell so strong

1120
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:52,019
and taste so strong yeah do you know the

1121
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,180
answer I don't know I don't know so

1122
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:56,280
basically when you first got it it was

1123
00:49:54,179 --> 00:50:00,239
skunk number one was an early finishing

1124
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:02,700
big bud very pretty it smelled like a

1125
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:06,299
skunk yeah did it smell like did it

1126
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:08,818

no no no not at all no no no no it was

1128
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:13,019
more the dark side of the like the

1129
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,059
earthy

1130
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,659
um

1131
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:21,480
Rudy and yes yes it was not no no no not

1132
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:23,338
any sweetness no not any uh any interest

1133
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,800
in it you know because what we're

1134
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:28,440
familiar with is as as younger people is

1135
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:32,280
skunk number one smells like floral it

1136
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,559
smells sweet it smells so you're saying

1137
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,079
um that what what Sam brought over first

1138
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,040
is very different than what ended up

1139
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:43,318
being common in Europe later

1140
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:47,099
yes yeah yeah because number one there

1141
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:50,099
are still a lot of seeds Bank around and

1142
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:52,200
they they they think or they they they

1143
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,760
they they they know I don't know they

1144
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:56,338
think that they still have screened

1145
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,980
number one but there there is no school

1146
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:01,019
number one anymore the only screen

1147
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:05,539
number one that is around is very

1148
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:05,539
diluted nothing to compare with um

1149
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,880
there is no real skunk number one

1150
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,500
anymore around

1151
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,318
the interesting because when he went

1152
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,719
there he gave seeds to you he gave some

1153
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:30,358
seeds to Neville it sounds like he gave

1154
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,639
some seeds to Bernard from positronics

1155
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:34,739
Mellow Yellow

1156
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,139
um what was the what was the little was

1157
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:39,179
the community in Amsterdam then did

1158
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:42,058
everyone know each other because yes yes

1159
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:43,980
the the the the thing is we didn't live

1160
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,200
in Amsterdam we still don't live in

1161
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:50,818
Amsterdam and there wasn't the Amsterdam

1162
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:53,419
scene was more about the outdoor growing

1163
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:56,099
um and then and and

1164
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,180
we I think we were the first ones in how

1165
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,180
long to grow indoors

1166
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:06,000
Sam teach a lot of people how to grow in

1167
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:08,159
a greenhouse and since Sam arrived in

1168
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,519
Holland the people started to grow in

1169
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,318
greenhouses because

1170
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:16,318
you could do it without a lot of trouble

1171
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:18,599
because nobody knew about

1172
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:22,199
how it smells and how it looks and

1173
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:25,079
basically uh the the first five years

1174
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:27,539
that Sam was around a lot of greenhouse

1175
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,940
growing was going on and he basically

1176
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:32,159
teached everybody and Holland how to do

1177
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:36,260
it and we we didn't grow in a greenhouse

1178
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,259
because in our opinion

1179
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:43,019
it's more safe to do it but then of

1180
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,760
course at the end of the day

1181
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:46,460
all the all the greenhouses were always

1182
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,800
always bursted

1183
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:52,980
they could do one group maybe second

1184
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,000
group was already uh this is a small

1185
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,639
country

1186
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,579
and there is no Countryside at all the

1187
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,338
greenhouses are all always close to a

1188
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:05,700
village close to a town with a lot of

1189
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:10,460
people around a lot of people live in

1190
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:10,460
one square mileage really tours

1191
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:19,078
we have the country it seems like you

1192
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:21,299
reclaim from the sea you know so yeah so

1193
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,039
um besides Hayes and skunk what else did

1194
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,039
you get from Sam

1195
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,039
never

1196
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:36,539
he get he got like early Pearl early

1197
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:40,079
from Rob maybe yeah early Pearl and a

1198
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:43,440
few other ones but also we were not we

1199
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,240
were not too much in touch with Neville

1200
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,240
because the Neville's approach was

1201
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:49,679
different than our approach uh we were

1202
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,679
underground people

1203
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:56,338
and we were not really

1204
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:59,098
um too fun to to receive a lot of people

1205
00:53:56,338 --> 00:54:01,980
we don't know in our house and then and

1206
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:03,599
in those days it never had the uh

1207
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,579
the Cannabis starts to let everybody

1208
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,119
even more or less was welcome over there

1209
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:10,859
but and especially when you came with a

1210
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,099
lot of money to buy seeds everybody was

1211
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:13,098
welcome

1212
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:19,199
and we were always more like hmm

1213
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:21,420
uh let's let's try to keep it

1214
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:25,078
underground and let's

1215
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:27,599
let's try to do it in a

1216
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:30,780
in a more of a more or less safe way

1217
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,460
because we we didn't want to get caught

1218
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,280
and we wanted to do the one in this

1219
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:37,619
business for forever you know and there

1220
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,380
never was more of Daredevil when he was

1221
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,579
like

1222
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:44,400
I don't know who came to his house

1223
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:49,140
anymore I I I I really don't know if he

1224
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,760
knew I don't think so you know because a

1225
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:52,798
lot of Americans in those days they came

1226
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,880
to Amsterdam and then everybody was

1227
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:59,059
welcome at Neville's place

1228
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:01,980
we were a little more careful too

1229
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:04,740
besides Sam where were some other

1230
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,019
sources in the previous conversation you

1231
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:09,118
had with Matt you told that a lot of

1232
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:12,539
stuff you got you were getting off seeds

1233
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,298
from buds out of coffee shops were there

1234
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,338
any other people or sources once you

1235
00:55:15,298 --> 00:55:20,039
started making super sativa seed Club

1236
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:22,619
where people coming to find you and

1237
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:25,019
trade scenes with you yeah but they were

1238
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:27,920
they were coming

1239
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:29,599
couldn't find this

1240
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,338
okay

1241
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,760
the only the only one who could find

1242
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:38,159
this was

1243
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:41,339
Rosenthal and George Cervantes and

1244
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,480
and the uh the chief editor of High

1245
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,679
Times

1246
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,780
um

1247
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,578
Stephen

1248
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,319
Hager of course yeah yeah yeah yeah and

1249
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:51,720
then those were the only three people

1250
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,920
who could face this because we were

1251
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:53,578
really like

1252
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,980
um

1253
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:58,339
we knew what we were we knew we

1254
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,900
understood what we were doing you know

1255
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:03,900
so then that that leads me to another

1256
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:07,559
question in your catalog you have

1257
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:09,900
something called Oakland Indica yeah and

1258
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,660
I'm just curious as to where that where

1259
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:16,680
you got that or where it came from

1260
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:19,259
you know I don't know because a few

1261
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:21,719
times because we had a lot of clients of

1262
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,420
course and then we we received a lot of

1263
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:27,239
letters in those days and a few times

1264
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:31,079
people sent us the seats but not only

1265
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:33,899
only a few times and I think because

1266
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:36,480
Oakland that that is from Oakland

1267
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,420
because in those days we got like 100

1268
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,519
letters every day you know and yeah it

1269
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:44,579
was really fun for us to read all those

1270
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:49,880
letters and also uh we

1271
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:53,519
um we ask people to help us to to

1272
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,900
distribute seats in the U.S and just we

1273
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,400
were just reading the letters and we

1274
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,639
thought oh this guy is a nice guy

1275
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,059
because he understands how it works yeah

1276
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:06,000
so it was a really nice job for me to

1277
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:09,240
read all these labs and to answer them

1278
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,460
as well because maybe even nowadays you

1279
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,379
still get letters from people from from

1280
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:16,380
the old days and they said ah nice to

1281
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:20,000
see you back and do you remember that we

1282
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:23,338
walked isn't there from you no of course

1283
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,679
that's really uh really funny and uh

1284
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:28,679
when we started again a few years ago we

1285
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:31,679
got a letter from somebody and he says

1286
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:35,279
now yeah nowadays Mother Nature is legal

1287
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:37,618
in the U.S and that we really thought a

1288
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,319
guy who who writes a letter and says

1289
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:43,798
modern nature is bleeding now you know

1290
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:46,199
yeah it used to be illegal but now we

1291
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:47,759
are happy that it's legal and that was

1292
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,019
those were the letters that we really

1293
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,480
liked and there are people who

1294
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:55,280
understood how crazy it is to make

1295
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,199
mother nature illegal yeah it is wild

1296
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,240
yeah so

1297
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:01,739
um what you got about the Durban Thai

1298
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,779
high flyer now that was one of your most

1299
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:05,219
famous lines yeah we still see it around

1300
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,440
today do you have any memories

1301
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:12,539
surrounding it yeah this was a very uh

1302
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,900
pure sativa of course and also um

1303
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:18,480
because of Durban is still in the south

1304
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,900
of the world that is almost in the same

1305
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,338
latitude and Holland is

1306
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,099
so the flowering times

1307
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:28,500
they are more or less the same than our

1308
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:32,160
flowering time because we our our

1309
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:35,519
Harvest our Autumn starts in September

1310
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:39,179
yeah and then also the the the the the

1311
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,880
the harvested it's getting colder so and

1312
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:44,399
we were lucky to have the Durban uh

1313
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,440
traveling so early the Durban was a very

1314
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,619
was the is the one sativa that's sort of

1315
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,619
an early finisher yeah so so it worked

1316
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:54,539
well in Holland yes and and and the

1317
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:56,099
combination with the with the tie

1318
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:59,000
because the tie is a very very late

1319
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:02,280
flowering yeah then then

1320
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,380
it's finished so like half October or

1321
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,000
something and that's nice for us because

1322
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:09,599
in October sometimes when you're lucky

1323
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,119
the weather is still good yeah but but

1324
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,059
our the our main customers in the US

1325
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:16,530
were the people from California the

1326
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:17,960
Vietnam veterans

1327
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:21,298
[Music]

1328
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,818
from Vietnam they started to do the

1329
00:59:21,298 --> 00:59:25,920
gorilla farming and they really they

1330
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:28,679
made money with it as well so they they

1331
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:32,420
did they send us a nice amounts of money

1332
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:32,419
yeah yeah

1333
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:39,179
well I mean from our perspective

1334
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,039
um you know back then especially indicas

1335
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:44,639
and things like that were pretty rare

1336
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:46,318
yeah even though California and America

1337
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,058
there was

1338
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,920
um there was you know there was a lot of

1339
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:52,619
things going on people didn't know each

1340
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,139
other so really like one of the most

1341
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:58,140
interesting things about what happened

1342
00:59:55,139 --> 01:00:00,000
with you guys for us is that

1343
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:01,858
um you know like you were saying before

1344
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,920
a bunch of stuff flowed from America

1345
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:07,558
over to amster over to Holland yeah and

1346
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,599
went everywhere in America

1347
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,280
it went to the house that went to the

1348
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,740
north New York it went to the Midwest

1349
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,619
and that was our goal that was our goal

1350
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:19,679
that's why we did this because we

1351
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:23,579
thought in those days yeah there's no

1352
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:26,098
internet so your your friends live close

1353
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:29,220
to you in the same town so you can swap

1354
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:32,039
sheets with your friends but it doesn't

1355
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:34,078
spread the whole country you know and

1356
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,539
then since we were starting we got

1357
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:39,559
letters from everywhere Alaska Texas

1358
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:43,440
whatever and then so

1359
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:46,140
we thought when all the refrigerators in

1360
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,720
the states are filled with seeds

1361
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:50,219
it's a difficult thing to stop it and

1362
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,259
there's this movement

1363
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:55,439
what about the what about your what

1364
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:58,200
about the creeper or the kyber pass yeah

1365
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,059
the the degree decree we called it the

1366
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:03,598
creepy because it was really

1367
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:05,880
um the plant it was not upright but it

1368
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,160
was laying down more or less it oh

1369
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,559
that's why I always assumed it was the

1370
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,719
high but it was no no no no no no no no

1371
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,740
it wasn't it was not about the high it

1372
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:19,259
was really about the the morphle logic

1373
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:21,719
uh aspects of the of the plant because

1374
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,880
normally a plant is like more or less

1375
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,939
like a Christmas tree but this one was

1376
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:30,838
like bending over and laying down

1377
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:34,079
you know and uh yeah I I still like this

1378
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:37,558
kind of uh plans because they they gave

1379
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:41,099
you a big Harvest yeah room for bits you

1380
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,380
know and yeah yeah and the guy the the

1381
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:45,420
the the chiropractor and we cross it

1382
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:49,380
with an Afghani

1383
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:52,079
um I think yes because of Afghani and

1384
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:55,798
Holland it will be the the hash from

1385
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:58,500
Afghanistan was really very popular and

1386
01:01:55,798 --> 01:02:01,199
um I don't know where we got the sheets

1387
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,298
from but did you guys ever grow flowers

1388
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,919
for coffee shops or did you just focus

1389
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:10,259
on seeds yes yes yes

1390
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:12,059
yeah because we we were growing for the

1391
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:15,299
coffee shops as well yeah yeah because

1392
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:17,099
we they liked our indoor read because it

1393
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:21,298
was quite it was new

1394
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:23,760
and um in those days we um

1395
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:25,980
we were worrying a little bit about the

1396
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,260
fact that our wheat was Green

1397
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,798
because

1398
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:34,319
people uh they were used to to buy

1399
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:37,318
marijuana was always Brown so half

1400
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:40,038
rotten meat as we call it now and and

1401
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:42,960
our indoor

1402
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,000
marijuana was green so we thought oh

1403
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,818
nobody's going to buy this because they

1404
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,980
they don't because green the The only

1405
01:02:47,818 --> 01:02:52,079
green marijuana we knew was that I was

1406
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,179
the neither beat and that was the wheat

1407
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,818
that we grew in our backyard

1408
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:59,219
and they didn't have Birds it was only

1409
01:02:56,818 --> 01:03:03,358
leaves and it was green so we were

1410
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:05,239
afraid that people thought our wheat was

1411
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:08,400
a little bit

1412
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:13,979
so we tried to make we tried to make it

1413
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:16,220
brown to to be able to to to sell it but

1414
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,420
after a few uh

1415
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:20,038
I don't know maybe after a year

1416
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,599
everybody said I don't know the green

1417
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:24,599
was the best one it's much better than

1418
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,780
the brown round man no man don't worry

1419
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,559
about the color will be buy it anyway

1420
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:31,019
so yeah

1421
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,940
yeah I was really that was a really

1422
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:35,159
funny thing yeah that he really people

1423
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,838
are really worried about the green color

1424
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:38,578
they were really worried because it was

1425
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:42,719
so because the part about that is that

1426
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:46,140
everything was so new yeah yeah it was

1427
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,578
new and then the first since Emilia that

1428
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:52,078
I saw in Holland

1429
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:54,420
that was somebody and then one year we

1430
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,280
had we were lucky enough to have a good

1431
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,760
September in Holland normally it's

1432
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:02,460
raining in September already but in this

1433
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,559
September there was a lot of sun

1434
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:08,220
so in the coffee shop where I worked

1435
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:11,760
somebody came with a garbage bag full of

1436
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:14,279
big birds and they were not trimmed at

1437
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,740
all and then I thought where does this

1438
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:20,700
come from because this I really didn't

1439
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:23,639
it was the first time we saw a green Big

1440
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:25,679
Bird plant but this this was also I

1441
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,000
think a German poison or something but

1442
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,699
he was lucky

1443
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,739
who grow some German poison seeds in a

1444
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:36,598
year that we had a very good nice

1445
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:38,759
September so the plant was to finish

1446
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:41,599
and that was really the first time that

1447
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,599
I saw shins

1448
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:48,179
you got into weed was by working in a

1449
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:50,460
coffee shop yes I worked in a coffee

1450
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:52,919
shop when I was like 18 years or 19

1451
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,858
years old and then one of the our

1452
01:04:52,920 --> 01:05:01,619
customers came to um to me and he said I

1453
01:04:55,858 --> 01:05:04,679
I am I I I I'm a reader of items

1454
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:06,838
magazine and I saw how they grew how

1455
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:09,659
they grow plants already because at

1456
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:13,440
Roosevelt was one of the first started

1457
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:17,038
with all data I think in the US and this

1458
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,679
guy said I bought a metal halide lamp

1459
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,020
because we have a big Horticultural

1460
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,719
syndrome here in Holland and in those

1461
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:27,000
days the the the greenhouse grower they

1462
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,098
they used it to grow cake

1463
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,960
the metal Airlines and he went there to

1464
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:35,460
buy one and he said I want to grow

1465
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,380
I'm about to start to use it and I

1466
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,500
thought I live in a squat house and

1467
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:43,400
let's do it so that's how it started

1468
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:47,780
because this guy he he didn't

1469
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,780
he was reader of items magazines

1470
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:54,538
so we knew so most of most of super

1471
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,359
sativa seed clubs uh work was all done

1472
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:58,980
indoors whether you were growing buds

1473
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:02,239
for coffee shops or whether you were

1474
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:06,298
making seeds yes

1475
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:09,318
we kept it inside yeah and that was all

1476
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:09,318
because of um

1477
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:15,660
you know and in a greenhouse it's the

1478
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,119
Holland is too crowded to grow in a

1479
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:20,578
greenhouse and it's uh

1480
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:22,858
no everybody got caught always in the

1481
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:24,960
greenhouse so

1482
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:27,779
we're growing it you

1483
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,679
guys did you have garages were you

1484
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:33,720
growing in bedrooms no maybe we had

1485
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,779
garages and we bought it at one point we

1486
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:39,419
bought a house especially to do it and

1487
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,980
um no no and I know those people are

1488
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,400
squatters yeah you know what squatters

1489
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:45,719
are yes

1490
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,320
and if you are a squatter you always

1491
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:47,759
have a house

1492
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,180
[Music]

1493
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,740
so you you squatted in the house and

1494
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:54,598
then you set up some lights and you set

1495
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:56,399
up some rooms to do breeding and grow

1496
01:06:54,599 --> 01:07:01,019
weed and you sold the weed to the coffee

1497
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:04,440
shops and you sold seeds catalog yeah

1498
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:07,639
yeah yeah and we were the best quarters

1499
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,639
but we earned a lot of money

1500
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,480
very cool

1501
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:16,920
we're not in it for the money man

1502
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:19,078
because but it was nice to have money to

1503
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:23,039
do that a lot of money came to us of

1504
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:26,059
course but it was not really our uh the

1505
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,059
the basic thing

1506
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:32,460
the funny thing for us is that now

1507
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:34,619
um you know there's so many seed

1508
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,240
companies in America and there's a lot

1509
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,539
of seed come from Europe and everything

1510
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:41,818
like that but when when you guys started

1511
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:45,900
and when Neville started there was

1512
01:07:41,818 --> 01:07:47,940
really only you two yeah that was easy

1513
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,980
like you said if you went to positronics

1514
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,900
if you went to Holland and went directly

1515
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:54,358
to certain coffee shops maybe you could

1516
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:58,798
get some seed then in order to order

1517
01:07:54,358 --> 01:08:01,558
things there was only two yes really so

1518
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:03,780
that your that your company's stuff and

1519
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:07,440
Neville's company stuff got spread so

1520
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,940
far and wide yeah yeah yeah but but when

1521
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,760
Neville stopped

1522
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:14,400
um

1523
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:17,039
look over then they both basically

1524
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,699
that's how sensation started they bought

1525
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:23,338
Neville stock and then they started in

1526
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:25,019
the name chances and then they've been

1527
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:27,479
drunk is the the

1528
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:30,000
the one that's the guy who started this

1529
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:31,500
this is really a big

1530
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,779
a big

1531
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,460
um thank to Ben because he was really

1532
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:38,120
the guy with the biggest balls you know

1533
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:41,279
he he he

1534
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:43,079
went on very very started where we

1535
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,560
stopped

1536
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:49,019
so do you think that um did Neville sell

1537
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,520
his company to Ben and Allen because of

1538
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:54,779
the trouble he got in

1539
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:58,859
I think so yeah did you in the community

1540
01:08:54,779 --> 01:09:00,239
back then were you ever we like was it a

1541
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:02,759
small enough community that you were

1542
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:06,000
close to a lot of these people yes yes

1543
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,439
but the thing I said I said before we

1544
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,140
were not really

1545
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,178
um we were we had our own group of

1546
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:15,659
people and we were not we we didn't live

1547
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:17,158
in Amsterdam you know so so uh you

1548
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:19,920
didn't live in Amsterdam you lived in

1549
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:22,318
different yeah yeah we lived in The

1550
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,279
Hague that's good it's uh close to

1551
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:28,259
Amsterdam but so uh

1552
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:30,900
maybe to be honest we tried to stay out

1553
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:34,500
of the all those

1554
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:37,698
groups I had to keep your head and stay

1555
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:41,579
quiet and yeah yeah

1556
01:09:37,698 --> 01:09:43,559
really and we were not like behaving

1557
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:46,500
like rockstars or something we were just

1558
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:50,759
uh we were just quotes running a

1559
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:53,579
cannabis scene business so how did

1560
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:55,619
um how did how did like Jorge Cervantes

1561
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:58,319
and Ed Rosenthal how did they find you

1562
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:59,460
did they write you yeah yeah they sent

1563
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,738
us a letter yeah they write them because

1564
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,600
in those days

1565
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:05,839
you wrote letters to people

1566
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,520
sure yeah

1567
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,960
and you put it and you put the stamp on

1568
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,080
the envelope and you put it in the

1569
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,520
mailbox that was

1570
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:18,198
maybe it's a good idea that we go back

1571
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:21,360
to this kind of communication again

1572
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:24,779
because nobody can listen to it yeah

1573
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,880
yeah did they um did they did they bring

1574
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:28,340
seeds too or did they want to just come

1575
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,679
up

1576
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,760
no but but I have a nice anecdote about

1577
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,800
uh

1578
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:38,280
Georgia Cervantes because he came to

1579
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,179
visit us and he asked us to uh to show

1580
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:42,479
around

1581
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:44,119
um to show to show him the the Dutch

1582
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:46,979
greenhouse because in those days the

1583
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:51,119
greenhouses they they were growing and

1584
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:54,359
metal under HBS large that we had

1585
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:57,179
greenhouses with ten thousand HPS lights

1586
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:59,819
in it and he never he didn't ever see

1587
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:02,279
this and so we gave him a tour and he

1588
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:07,698
came he showed up in the tour with a

1589
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:07,698
nice t-shirt cannabis USA California

1590
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:14,579
that's not how it goes you have to put

1591
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,500
put on some some different teachers man

1592
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:18,600
because we can't show you around in the

1593
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,640
greenhouse wearing this t-shirt and said

1594
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,460
oh why that is it's legal in Holland

1595
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,560
isn't it no no no it's not legal at all

1596
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,980
everybody thinks it's legal but it's

1597
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,380
it's it is not legal so um we had to

1598
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:33,000
teach a little bit how to behave in

1599
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,420
Holland

1600
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,460
we had the same we had the same issue in

1601
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:41,399
uh in California where I live when

1602
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,439
medical first happened 20 years ago a

1603
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:46,019
lot of people thought it was legal

1604
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:49,019
but it's really legal it was it was kind

1605
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:52,159
of like Holland it was permitted but you

1606
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:54,300
could still get in trouble anytime yeah

1607
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:56,099
I know a lot of people from California

1608
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,800
and they still they always tell me it's

1609
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,140
still illegal man yeah yeah it's still

1610
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,539
early it was still whether or not the

1611
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:05,100
cop wanted to be nice to you they could

1612
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:06,600
treat you any which way they wanted and

1613
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,020
it was kind of the same about Holland

1614
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:12,360
I'm sure too yeah it all depended on the

1615
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,760
attitude yeah yeah and that's that's why

1616
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:17,579
we try to keep a little bit underground

1617
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:20,699
because of uh we wanted to go up on this

1618
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:23,939
and then I I wanted to I I'm I'm having

1619
01:12:20,698 --> 01:12:27,178
a family and everything and I was really

1620
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:30,899
I'm not that type of guy who wants to be

1621
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:32,340
in the big pictures me either I feel you

1622
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:35,759
on that

1623
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:37,800
um uh so after you started breeding at

1624
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,140
supersetv seed club for a while and you

1625
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,360
realize that you got popular did you

1626
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,880
start keeping a lot of breeding males

1627
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:46,799
and breeding females like yeah yeah yeah

1628
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,260
yeah basically we had like a nice

1629
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:52,079
collection of uh of males and females

1630
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:54,119
and in those days we did not do uh the

1631
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:57,359
feminized breathing that didn't exist

1632
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:59,279
yet so so it was not so very difficult

1633
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:02,939
the breeding that we did

1634
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:06,359
so we we sometimes did a little bit in

1635
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:09,059
breathing and but not too much it was

1636
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:12,059
more we we basically did funeral hunting

1637
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,739
and the the best ones we liked we

1638
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,120
crossed with each other

1639
01:13:13,738 --> 01:13:17,279
and

1640
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:18,599
um yeah and everybody was happy with the

1641
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,300
seeds because

1642
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,280
for a lot of people our customers was

1643
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:26,340
it's either nothing

1644
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:29,639
or or something from Amsterdam that

1645
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:32,279
really gave you nice flowers nice nice

1646
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,020
bits and then the people that sent this

1647
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:36,979
photo to them sent us letters and they

1648
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,980
were really uh

1649
01:13:37,819 --> 01:13:42,658
they were really nice photos and uh

1650
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:44,539
everybody was happy

1651
01:13:42,658 --> 01:13:47,279
it was really nice

1652
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:49,920
so how many how many people were

1653
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:53,279
involved in your in your company yeah we

1654
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,699
were two people through the and like

1655
01:13:53,279 --> 01:14:00,259
four or five people helping us

1656
01:13:55,698 --> 01:14:00,259
like a little Collective yeah

1657
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:06,000
at the biggest part of it how many

1658
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:08,039
houses did you have or how many how many

1659
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,179
different places were you grown like

1660
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:11,179
five six different places

1661
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:19,639
we did not do that because in those days

1662
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:23,219
there were also people

1663
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:26,100
who really uh after five years or so a

1664
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:30,000
lot of people that came into the they

1665
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:33,300
rented big warehouses and put 200 lamps

1666
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,819
in it but we uh you know we we did the

1667
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,860
damage on a smaller scale because we've

1668
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:40,139
all been we were not growing that much

1669
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:41,460
weeds people more more Growing Seeds in

1670
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:44,460
those days you know

1671
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,198
I mean there's a there's a lot of you

1672
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,300
know you could call them American seed

1673
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:50,339
companies these days

1674
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,100
um that exist just like that

1675
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:55,100
it's some basement it's a few bedroom

1676
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:58,260
house

1677
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:00,060
yeah of course I see a lot of people

1678
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,880
they they have some clones and they make

1679
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:07,080
roses and uh and and then you'll see

1680
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,760
companies born yeah your skunk Haze yes

1681
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:10,079
really old

1682
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,480
yeah

1683
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:15,600
how long does it flower for

1684
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:20,399
12 weeks and then they better do the one

1685
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,360
week of 13 weeks 13 is better yeah and

1686
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,359
um

1687
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:26,519
how did it I mean 35 years old I'm

1688
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:28,799
always fascinated by how things survive

1689
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,679
because

1690
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:35,159
for us in America it seems like every

1691
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:37,920
five or ten years uh the weed the the

1692
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:41,879
seed game reinvents itself and you can't

1693
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,658
get what you used to be able to get so

1694
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,659
um

1695
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:47,460
did it did was it just so such a nice

1696
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:49,259
Cut and there's such a nice plant that

1697
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:52,560
various people saved it and passed it

1698
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:56,159
around is it something that has been

1699
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:58,920
always in like two or three places and I

1700
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:01,379
like to use that it was more like a

1701
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,520
group of people we even work with

1702
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,699
and

1703
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:09,239
um yeah it's still around and and then

1704
01:16:05,698 --> 01:16:12,000
we let them uh we have our mother

1705
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:14,639
planned when it's like uh three or four

1706
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,520
months old we take a new cut we throw

1707
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:21,000
away the old plant and we start from

1708
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:24,300
with a little clone again and a few

1709
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,819
friends of me of my they have it and

1710
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,560
then yeah because you can you can

1711
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,698
imagine in 35 years there are lots of

1712
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,860
things happening awesome really

1713
01:16:31,698 --> 01:16:38,399
we are proud We are proud of it to still

1714
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:39,599
have it and we are now working on on

1715
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:40,219
trying to

1716
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,539
um

1717
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:46,619
to uh to breed and say yeah

1718
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:49,859
we are working with a few American

1719
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:54,719
varieties because we like the from those

1720
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:56,059
days we like the big firm but with a lot

1721
01:16:54,719 --> 01:17:00,239
of resin

1722
01:16:56,060 --> 01:17:02,840
but sometimes it lacks a little bit of

1723
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:05,819
flavor a little bit of taste and smell

1724
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:09,000
and now we are trying to put the smell

1725
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:12,119
of the old school Haze and the eye

1726
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,198
preferable as well and the taste into a

1727
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:18,658
new and and to the American rice

1728
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:22,500
and that takes a while but um

1729
01:17:18,658 --> 01:17:25,219
it's really interesting to see a plant

1730
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:29,579
that grows like a cookie or something

1731
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:33,000
American style and then with the old

1732
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:35,279
school taste and smelling that's that's

1733
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,920
the thing that we are working on and

1734
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,960
maybe people

1735
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:42,859
some people knock down yeah why do you

1736
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:46,500
do this you try to keep it like it is

1737
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:48,479
but I want to because at the end of the

1738
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,779
day a lot of people from commercial

1739
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,479
these days and it's nice to have a big

1740
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:58,319
yield of course

1741
01:17:53,479 --> 01:18:01,678
but also a fluffy bird is nowadays

1742
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,019
considered like big quality a lot of

1743
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,960
people don't understand that at the end

1744
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,480
of the day your birth you put it in a

1745
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,939
paper and you smoke it so it doesn't it

1746
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:15,559
doesn't really a big deal how the bird

1747
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:19,819
looks I agree the big deal

1748
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:22,699
and how it works but

1749
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:26,519
you agree and I agree but

1750
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:31,439
a lot of people the eye also wants you

1751
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:33,239
know yeah I mean and the way that that

1752
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:34,979
social media works now a lot of times

1753
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:38,000
the only things that people see of

1754
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:40,799
different buds are pictures yeah and

1755
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,479
might look very ugly even though it

1756
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,880
might work wonderfully and make you very

1757
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:46,859
happy and it might take great you can't

1758
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,520
tell that through the picture yeah

1759
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:52,799
because nowadays if you have five like

1760
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:56,239
five different varieties and four of

1761
01:18:52,800 --> 01:19:00,060
them are American things and one of them

1762
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:03,718
is uh sativa thing

1763
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:05,400
and everybody says we don't we want to

1764
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:08,399
we don't want to have it because it

1765
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:12,059
looks strange for us it's French and

1766
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:13,738
especially yeah because I'm 63 or years

1767
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,440
old already so

1768
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:18,839
and normally it's I think it's normal

1769
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:22,139
that the younger people like other

1770
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,719
things but we also want to show things

1771
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:27,719
from the past

1772
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:29,579
I mean it's uh I mean for instance you

1773
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:32,760
know it's really interesting because for

1774
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:35,579
us skunk one you know to bring it back

1775
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,739
again is very very very different from

1776
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:39,658
what you experienced I don't think I've

1777
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:43,019
experienced skunk one like you remember

1778
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:45,839
it no time that we got a hold of it what

1779
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:47,699
you remember was gone yeah and that

1780
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,679
happened a lot where if you don't have

1781
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:51,779
old things or people aren't saving old

1782
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,760
cuttings or you can't get old seeds to

1783
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:57,019
sprout then the way people remember

1784
01:19:53,760 --> 01:20:00,480
something it's just gone yeah

1785
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,940
how long ago you get excited again about

1786
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:06,238
maybe you could restart super sativa

1787
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:09,119
seed Club in a new form yeah yeah we

1788
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,539
already started it but we we don't sell

1789
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,859
anymore

1790
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:17,460
because those were the wild days

1791
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:19,799
nowadays it's uh it's not a good idea to

1792
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:22,619
sell something in the US for a moment no

1793
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:25,920
not yet it could change we're slowly

1794
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:27,359
moving in that direction but I mean I

1795
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,179
don't know have you ever heard of ditch

1796
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,279
passion yes yeah because we were

1797
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:34,440
together with this person they did a

1798
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:36,300
friend of us and they they are this is

1799
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:39,119
really a very successful seed company

1800
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:41,219
but they don't sell one seat in the US

1801
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,960
and if you know that the half of the

1802
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:44,158
visitors of the website comes from the

1803
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,158
US

1804
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:47,158
today

1805
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:55,138
it you know it uh hopefully that will

1806
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,719
change in the next or so years yeah it

1807
01:20:55,139 --> 01:21:00,420
looks like America we're not complicated

1808
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:03,420
in the US man with those federal laws

1809
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:04,440
and uh it's really not a good idea and

1810
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:08,340
uh

1811
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:11,219
you know but maybe one day things change

1812
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,020
and then we can because because it's of

1813
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:14,520
course crazy that half of the visitors

1814
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:16,860
of a website

1815
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:19,679
it comes from the US it comes from the

1816
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:22,979
US yeah they want to watch this but we

1817
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:27,420
don't do it oh yeah I understand

1818
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:28,919
um when uh so is is uh so basically you

1819
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,480
you're making stuff for the Holland

1820
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,779
market now

1821
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:35,819
um European market for European market

1822
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:38,219
you were talking in the in the previous

1823
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:39,840
interview you did with Matt you were

1824
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:44,480
talking about how you sort of like

1825
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,480
recollected some other hazes besides

1826
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,560
yeah because now I'm in a good position

1827
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,020
of course to

1828
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,760
I know a lot of people and I know all

1829
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:56,580
the hats

1830
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,219
from Europe you know no I mean you're

1831
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:01,260
certainly of of that generation that uh

1832
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:04,260
you know probably known these people for

1833
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:06,539
decades yes yes and then and and then we

1834
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:08,760
are happy that a lot that the haste

1835
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:12,179
people always are the people who really

1836
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:13,460
understand uh how important it is to to

1837
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:16,500
save things

1838
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:19,020
and then there is still a lot of stuff

1839
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:22,619
around you know because we have

1840
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:26,520
yeah like five five different loans

1841
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:28,679
still and then other people are there we

1842
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,179
have the old school age we have the nl5

1843
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:33,359
timeshace

1844
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:36,300
and they have the AC and the h

1845
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:38,779
a and it's not the boy as everybody

1846
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:42,239
thinks but because we have the girls

1847
01:22:38,779 --> 01:22:45,380
and we have the Outback H that's the

1848
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:45,379
last thing Neville uh

1849
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:52,440
the famous boy

1850
01:22:49,979 --> 01:22:54,299
yeah no no the thing is that there is a

1851
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:57,059
lot of confusion going on always about

1852
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:00,719
the Jesus boys and girls but what we

1853
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:04,139
have is the A and the AC and it's both

1854
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,119
wheels and it's really yeah yeah and

1855
01:23:04,139 --> 01:23:09,239
then

1856
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:11,279
of course you have the A5 and C5

1857
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:13,259
I personally don't have it but my

1858
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,759
friends have it and it's really but when

1859
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,579
we want to use it to make a cross or

1860
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,840
something we can add it but

1861
01:23:16,579 --> 01:23:20,158
it's a group of people and everybody

1862
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,260
knows each other

1863
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,059
it's from the south

1864
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:27,060
but when you when you're talking about

1865
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:29,460
the girls that are A and C you're not

1866
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:31,620
talking about A5 or C5 you're talking

1867
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,779
about different that's different plans

1868
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:36,899
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's really

1869
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:37,738
the um especially the ace

1870
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:39,658
um

1871
01:23:37,738 --> 01:23:41,218
the the one I like best is the

1872
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:43,079
outbreakers

1873
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:45,480
the Outback here yeah because the

1874
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:48,719
Outback Haze is really the the incense

1875
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:52,500
smell and it has the instant smell

1876
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:54,779
and it's uh it makes you a high totally

1877
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:57,658
high it's really when you smoke it then

1878
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:59,639
then you think Hmm

1879
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:04,638
I understood it all

1880
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:04,639
and then half an hour later where was I

1881
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:10,920
I didn't try anything but

1882
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,739
that's a female you got from friends or

1883
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,359
is that a female

1884
01:24:12,738 --> 01:24:17,539
because we got to

1885
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,880
um yeah yeah I don't think you know them

1886
01:24:17,539 --> 01:24:22,560
she's called Mishka

1887
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:25,380
Mishka is a famous activist here in New

1888
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,300
York she's from France it's a it's a

1889
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:29,699
it's an it's an older lady and she's

1890
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:32,219
really an activist and she was the best

1891
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:33,960
friend of Neville and Neville gave this

1892
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:38,219
to her

1893
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:40,260
and since it passed away and she also

1894
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:42,600
Neville passed away

1895
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,820
yes he gave [ __ ] to us also because

1896
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:49,079
these older this is quite old already

1897
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:51,960
and then see it's like what Sam did you

1898
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:54,119
gave it to somebody who know who who can

1899
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:57,300
handle it you know who know who knows

1900
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:59,519
how to to save it are you planning on

1901
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:01,980
doing some breeding with somebody doing

1902
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,920
breathing the because we are now doing a

1903
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:07,619
breathing but that's a feminized

1904
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,619
breathing because when you have two

1905
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:12,779
girls there's no man there's no male so

1906
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:15,439
you know do you need to do feminized

1907
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:17,658
breathing and we have now we have two

1908
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:20,039
and still yeah

1909
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:23,039
I think it's going to be a successful

1910
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:24,479
project because maybe I mean when you're

1911
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:27,658
breathing you have to establish a few

1912
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:30,178
girls girls already not too much but our

1913
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:34,399
goals are always the high the smell and

1914
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:36,859
the taste those are my top three yeah

1915
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:41,099
it's nice when there's a world of resume

1916
01:25:36,859 --> 01:25:43,979
to be seen but we don't go for flowering

1917
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:46,920
time or something I don't know because

1918
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:49,619
now we also can do some breeding and

1919
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:51,960
legal situations so then we don't have

1920
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:55,099
to worry about flowering time

1921
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:58,139
right yeah because a lot of people there

1922
01:25:55,100 --> 01:26:00,179
DNA genetics you know them of course yes

1923
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:03,300
maybe they are also friends of us in

1924
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:05,940
this day said yeah it's nice what you're

1925
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:08,940
doing but it's going to be um

1926
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:11,339
a problem to sell those seeds because in

1927
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:14,460
those nowadays people don't want to

1928
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:18,060
spend 12 or 12 weeks 30 weeks waiting

1929
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:20,880
for their office anymore it's changing I

1930
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:23,159
think I hope so because when you're

1931
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:25,619
growing legal like you guys can do this

1932
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:29,339
there why why should you bother about

1933
01:26:25,619 --> 01:26:31,019
the flowering time yes no it's checking

1934
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:32,819
for a long time they were right people

1935
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,920
didn't want things that went longer than

1936
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:37,439
eight to ten weeks yeah because you have

1937
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:40,020
to run a little bit of pollution put the

1938
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:43,019
police on their heels and to make sure

1939
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:45,060
that it comes in fast but there's a lot

1940
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:47,760
of people now that are willing to do 12

1941
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:50,219
13 Even 14 week strains if they're nice

1942
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:54,060
enough people are getting excited about

1943
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:56,939
it and also regarding weight

1944
01:26:54,060 --> 01:27:01,020
the extra three weeks will give you 40

1945
01:26:56,939 --> 01:27:02,698
extra weight right the best the best

1946
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,920
yielding varieties are the sativa

1947
01:27:02,698 --> 01:27:06,738
varieties and we are they all laugh a

1948
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,940
little bit about

1949
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:12,178
something making a little bit thrown

1950
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:13,019
about in your American strains you like

1951
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:14,579
that

1952
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:17,460
but they don't yield

1953
01:27:14,579 --> 01:27:20,100
no no there's a lot of them that don't

1954
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:24,719
yield that's very true

1955
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:28,380
um of course yeah so they don't

1956
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:31,619
um you know they uh so your your skunk

1957
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:35,000
Haze the haze in it is from one of the

1958
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:37,260
ten seeds that Neville's that stands

1959
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,319
there is nothing closer to the real

1960
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,600
haste than the screencase that I have

1961
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:45,599
because most people it seems like most

1962
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:49,079
people in Holland ended up using a lot

1963
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:51,120
of Neville's hybrids of haze and those

1964
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:54,300
could be a lot of the one the cuts that

1965
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,698
got saved yes but as a result of that

1966
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,380
that means that most Haze is only from

1967
01:27:56,698 --> 01:28:01,979
one or two plants

1968
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:03,779
yes so you third you have you have Hayes

1969
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:05,819
that's not even his which is pretty

1970
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:08,819
exciting yeah because the the difference

1971
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:12,359
between uh our Haze and Nepal stations

1972
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:14,698
never never did all the his crosses with

1973
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:17,819
the Northern Lights

1974
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:19,399
and we did it at screen number one and

1975
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:24,299
foreign

1976
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:26,698
like A5 and C5 and all those it's all

1977
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:28,320
um Haze with Northern Light in it and

1978
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:31,979
Northern Light is not really a plant

1979
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:36,179
with a nice taste it's like a metallic

1980
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:39,000
a metallic taste and it's really not uh

1981
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:41,880
there are not the terms in the in the in

1982
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,100
the crosses that never made are not so

1983
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,020
nice then the Terps in the and the

1984
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:48,960
screen case because the screen was a

1985
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:51,719
really dirty

1986
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,819
so we were already that our line our

1987
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:56,100
line is it's currently number one and

1988
01:28:53,819 --> 01:28:58,679
Neville's lines are a bit with the

1989
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,960
northern northern lights and Northern

1990
01:28:58,679 --> 01:29:03,119
Lights came from the U.S

1991
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,980
are there are there coffee shops and

1992
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:06,899
stuff like that where where people can

1993
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:10,279
still get your skunk Haze on any kind of

1994
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:10,279
basis yes yes yes yes

1995
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:16,100
it's still available like if people were

1996
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:18,539
to go to you could find it

1997
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:21,120
only a few people grow it because it's

1998
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:23,479
complicated to grow right we really need

1999
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:27,000
to uh to have your climate under control

2000
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:28,799
and in an illegal situation it's not so

2001
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,060
very easy because then you need to work

2002
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,060
with Airco

2003
01:29:32,119 --> 01:29:37,279
units you know because the the screen

2004
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:41,760
case when the temperature

2005
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:46,079
rises above 28 Celsius then they start

2006
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:48,659
to run the boots and that means then it

2007
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:52,139
gets very fluffy and sometimes you get

2008
01:29:48,658 --> 01:29:54,238
like 10 branches and then you start

2009
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:57,960
again and when this happens after eight

2010
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:59,638
weeks of flowering again the 12 weeks of

2011
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,139
flowering starts and then it then we're

2012
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:03,319
talking about 20 weeks and that's too

2013
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:03,319
much

2014
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,780
if you really know how it's really a

2015
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,000
very difficult plant to grow

2016
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:14,399
if you have too much nutrients they

2017
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,979
start to stretch and they start to do

2018
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:19,079
crazy things

2019
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:22,859
do it the right way it takes 12 or 13

2020
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:28,039
weeks yeah and then the right way is not

2021
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:28,039
one hour above 28 degrees Celsius

2022
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:34,279
when you have one day when your Airco

2023
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,279
breaks down or something

2024
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:41,039
it's gone so you you uh what what

2025
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,980
excites you about

2026
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,380
your new uh your new Venture with super

2027
01:30:43,979 --> 01:30:47,698
sativa seed Club are you working are you

2028
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,340
working with your son are you working

2029
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:51,859
with us

2030
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:56,779
yeah yeah

2031
01:30:51,859 --> 01:30:56,779
and then and also um we are

2032
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,399
um we are very close to get the permit

2033
01:30:59,819 --> 01:31:05,460
to grow in Holland uh legal

2034
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:07,439
yeah yeah because now the the Dutch

2035
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:10,079
government issued 10 permits to grow

2036
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:12,178
legal for the coffee shops around and we

2037
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:16,439
were lucky enough to to win the lottery

2038
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:19,920
because it was a lottery 100 150 people

2039
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:22,379
applied for the for the license and only

2040
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,960
40 went through the first round because

2041
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:27,060
you you need to be able to grow a lot of

2042
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,920
weed you need to have money you need to

2043
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,420
have the skills to do it you need to

2044
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:34,319
have the conference in the coffee shop

2045
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:36,960
and we all have this and uh then

2046
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:39,420
basically there were 40 people left and

2047
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:42,539
then they they made a lottery and we

2048
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:44,760
were lucky enough to win one of the 10

2049
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:46,460
pyramids so when you win it does that

2050
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,920
mean that at some point in the future

2051
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:53,880
like Matt and I could fly to Holland and

2052
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:57,119
we could buy Super sativa seed Club weed

2053
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:59,460
at Coffee yes and it would be branded

2054
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,260
and we know it was from you and you grew

2055
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:03,840
an illegal facility and then you'd sell

2056
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:06,560
it to like damn or somebody like that

2057
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,960
that's the idea yes that's the idea

2058
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:12,560
that's very exciting yeah yeah that's

2059
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:15,658
the idea yeah yeah yeah yeah

2060
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:17,820
it will take because now it's a

2061
01:32:15,658 --> 01:32:20,899
government business so it takes a little

2062
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:23,399
bit longer you know as you can imagine

2063
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:26,399
we are waiting waiting waiting waiting

2064
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:29,179
there's that one one in a few weeks or

2065
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:31,399
months we will get the pyramid and then

2066
01:32:29,179 --> 01:32:35,039
it's very important

2067
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:38,099
in a peaceful way

2068
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:40,198
because that's that's a it's a lifetime

2069
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,719
of waiting for that huh yeah because

2070
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:44,759
that for me especially it's uh very nice

2071
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,840
because then the circle is around you

2072
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,100
know

2073
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,219
yeah

2074
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:54,000
uh California is the same way it's just

2075
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:56,279
become legal but a lot of money a lot of

2076
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,679
rules a lot of regulations a lot of

2077
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:03,000
government involved a lot of permits

2078
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:06,000
yeah uh lucky enough to uh to have the

2079
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,520
example of Canada and the US to tell our

2080
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,380
government

2081
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,060
if you want to make this a success don't

2082
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,960
make the same mistakes as they did in

2083
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:15,840
Canada

2084
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,639
so because in Canada people from the

2085
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,579
black market

2086
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:22,380
can't be involved in this but here in

2087
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:24,600
Holland we taught the government without

2088
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:27,779
people from the black market this is not

2089
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,520
going to be successful no the people

2090
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:32,158
from the black market they know how to

2091
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,360
do it and basically where does the

2092
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:36,179
government

2093
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:37,738
it can get information from the account

2094
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:39,719
you can't read the information about

2095
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:42,059
these kind of things in the paper so you

2096
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:43,739
need to talk with people from the black

2097
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:46,380
market

2098
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:47,899
we basically helped the government to to

2099
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:50,279
make this happen

2100
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:51,899
you did you worked with them government

2101
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:54,719
is wise enough

2102
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:57,799
to understand that they don't can do

2103
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:57,800
this without the black market

2104
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,819
so then when if they make it legal will

2105
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:05,399
you mostly be going in greenhouses like

2106
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:07,799
traditional we will do a combination of

2107
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:09,658
greenhouse and indoor growing and indoor

2108
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:13,320
growing organic maybe it'll be worth 100

2109
01:34:09,658 --> 01:34:15,420
organic huh yeah you call it bio over

2110
01:34:13,319 --> 01:34:17,399
there no that's bio here yeah it's

2111
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,840
calling by yeah

2112
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:20,579
yeah

2113
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,619
so yeah and then the circle is around

2114
01:34:20,579 --> 01:34:25,679
and yeah

2115
01:34:22,619 --> 01:34:28,319
so I mean if if you want to wrap it up

2116
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,300
here that that that's wonderful

2117
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:32,219
um I thank you so much for your time it

2118
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,779
was wonderful to hear these stories yeah

2119
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:35,460
let's keep in touch and you're an

2120
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:37,599
amazing interview man you you know your

2121
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:42,179
[ __ ] I love it

2122
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:43,800
[Music]

2123
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:45,960
all right that can

2124
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,639
say it's part of the interview

2125
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,960
um so right now we're gonna go over some

2126
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:50,940
of the highlights of the interview

2127
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,579
things that we we picked out and thought

2128
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:56,158
were very very unique and uh

2129
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:58,139
otherwise important to highlight

2130
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:00,960
so let's talk about some things

2131
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:02,760
uh well probably in no particular order

2132
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,000
but one of the really interesting parts

2133
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:09,060
for me was hearing him talk about the

2134
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,600
imported weed from South America from

2135
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,980
South Africa and Durban and that you

2136
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,139
know you and I have talked a bunch in

2137
01:35:13,979 --> 01:35:19,439
the past about how we thought most of

2138
01:35:16,139 --> 01:35:22,440
the Durbin in Amsterdam came from what

2139
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,000
Mel Frank gave to Sam Skunk Man sure we

2140
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:26,158
thought that's what proliferated most of

2141
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,960
what was being used back then right and

2142
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:29,579
so while certainly that that was

2143
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:32,520
proliferated over there and plenty of

2144
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:34,439
people sold it and bred with it sure now

2145
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:37,500
we find out that there was literally a

2146
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:39,658
Durban Poison coffee shop yeah Corel and

2147
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:43,560
others were getting bag seeds from

2148
01:35:39,658 --> 01:35:46,019
seeded cannabis from Durban uh and using

2149
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:48,840
in their own work so significantly

2150
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:52,560
widens the gene pool of what we thought

2151
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:54,900
and it also could lead to uh where you

2152
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:58,080
know Mel talked extensively about how

2153
01:35:54,899 --> 01:36:00,719
his uh Durbin was much more anus much

2154
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,698
more licorice in flavor and he's not

2155
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,739
sure why the Dutch bred it in the way

2156
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:07,019
that they did yeah but with that tidbit

2157
01:36:04,738 --> 01:36:10,079
of information it's possible that his

2158
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,760
was anise and so there's an anocyte to

2159
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:15,359
Durbin but then there's also a more

2160
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:17,400
terpenoline leaning uh Durban that came

2161
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,559
from South Africa and was found in

2162
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,479
seeded wheat yeah and that could account

2163
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,480
for the vast differences between those

2164
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:25,559
two Durban families uh yeah because it's

2165
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:27,419
all kind of gotten the same

2166
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,739
classification but as we know just

2167
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:32,158
because it's from the same region

2168
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:34,859
doesn't mean it's it's remotely the same

2169
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:37,439
no not whatsoever so that was that was

2170
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:39,479
pretty amazing information because we've

2171
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:42,658
us and others have assumed for a long

2172
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:44,939
time yeah that most people were selling

2173
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:46,979
the same Durban Poison yeah that was

2174
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:47,939
fascinating uh what are the one of the

2175
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:49,439
points that I thought was really

2176
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:51,658
interesting and

2177
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:54,719
it's something that's been kind of uh

2178
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:56,638
mythical ever since sssc kind of you

2179
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:57,840
know moved away from the scene in that

2180
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,480
you know there was a lot of rumors

2181
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,860
building up about why that happened

2182
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:05,579
um there were people coming out and

2183
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:08,639
saying I worked for sssc and I was sssc

2184
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:10,380
America or my uncle you know or my

2185
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:13,560
uncles bread

2186
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:15,779
certain lines for sssc in Virginia or

2187
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,280
somewhere in America I thought that was

2188
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:20,340
fascinating to hear that there were no

2189
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,380
Americans involved in sssc because

2190
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,539
that's been a rumor that's built up in

2191
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:27,179
many a few at least companies have been

2192
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:28,979
started off that yeah I mean certainly

2193
01:37:27,179 --> 01:37:32,039
there's uh more than more than one

2194
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:33,959
person has had claims of that level so

2195
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:37,319
it was interesting to hear that while

2196
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:39,840
they did Source uh uh stuff from America

2197
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:42,658
like apparently as we heard uh Williams

2198
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,400
Wonder uh yeah from New York which is

2199
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:46,559
pretty cool I've never heard that part

2200
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:48,779
before yeah I hadn't either and

2201
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:52,380
obviously he talked about all skunk

2202
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:54,840
coming from California and the Sam Rob

2203
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:56,460
group you know to them

2204
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:58,739
um but it does seem a little bit like

2205
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,600
Neville they collected they collected

2206
01:37:58,738 --> 01:38:01,859
some things and he he talked it was

2207
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,960
pretty cool how he talked about people

2208
01:38:01,859 --> 01:38:05,819
with straight write him letters yeah

2209
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,039
that's how he met made most of his

2210
01:38:05,819 --> 01:38:10,079
American Connections was people like Ed

2211
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:12,118
or whoever writing them letters and

2212
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:13,439
wanted to come see them can you imagine

2213
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:15,179
just being able to write in a letter

2214
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:17,219
being like hey I'd love to come visit

2215
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:19,199
and all of a sudden bam you're there

2216
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:21,960
you're at the camera people are standing

2217
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,638
in seeds or buds yeah America's

2218
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:25,800
certainly contributed to what they had

2219
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:27,300
to offer uh but apparently I mean he

2220
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:31,500
said you know all their breeding was

2221
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:33,480
done and five or six homes basically uh

2222
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:35,279
you know that type of thing the other

2223
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:37,198
little tidbit that's not really like

2224
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:40,559
seed specific but makes a lot of sense

2225
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:42,779
was uh you know when he talked about how

2226
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,719
easy uh it was to get busted in

2227
01:38:42,779 --> 01:38:48,059
greenhouses because all of Holland is

2228
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:50,300
highly developed and so a greenhouse is

2229
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:52,800
in a neighborhood yeah

2230
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:54,239
living in Mendocino County and anybody

2231
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,579
that lives in the western part of

2232
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:58,799
America we're pretty spread out yeah

2233
01:38:56,579 --> 01:39:00,719
there's lots of remote rural areas

2234
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,279
there's lots of places you can do things

2235
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,319
you can buy property where you can get

2236
01:39:02,279 --> 01:39:06,420
away with it yeah um and it was pretty

2237
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,460
it was interesting when you think of a

2238
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:11,039
society that's so much older than ours

2239
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:13,319
and they've just populated every good

2240
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:15,359
part of the land yeah and so there's

2241
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:17,340
really nowhere to hide so for them in

2242
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:18,658
order to not get busted

2243
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:20,219
um it was I mean he basically said it

2244
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:21,539
was like you were one and done at most

2245
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:23,399
of those places

2246
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:25,079
one of my favorite Parts was when you

2247
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:27,539
were interviewing him and he was talking

2248
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:28,559
about maybe you can uh go over it a

2249
01:39:27,539 --> 01:39:29,760
little bit more because you were doing

2250
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,980
the interview but when he was talking

2251
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,360
about the green bud and and not being

2252
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:35,399
able to sell green Bud because it wasn't

2253
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:37,618
what they were used to oh yeah if you

2254
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:40,198
see my face on the video I think my eyes

2255
01:39:37,618 --> 01:39:42,299
are probably as big as saucers because

2256
01:39:40,198 --> 01:39:43,919
one of the things that's interesting in

2257
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,360
talking to like the you know what we've

2258
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:49,079
talked about is like the Pioneer

2259
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:51,059
generation yeah you know uh is you know

2260
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:52,859
like Rob Clark and some of these guys

2261
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:56,460
that were writing the Bible for breeding

2262
01:39:52,859 --> 01:39:58,920
is just how new it all was yeah and so

2263
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:01,439
to think that in the mid 80s as they

2264
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:03,179
first grew weed for themselves that was

2265
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:06,839
the first time any of them had seen

2266
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:08,940
green Bud yeah because brown and gold or

2267
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,920
red or various kinds of cure or whatever

2268
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:12,738
that was the standard there was no other

2269
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:15,000
kind just awesome

2270
01:40:12,738 --> 01:40:16,819
that it looked that way when it was

2271
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,698
fresh yeah

2272
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:22,979
they grow homegrown and it comes out the

2273
01:40:20,698 --> 01:40:25,379
way homegrown does and they're not even

2274
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:27,299
sure they're going to be able to sell it

2275
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:28,380
because no one's ever seen it I'm sure

2276
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,940
they didn't even know if it would get

2277
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:31,920
them High when they first looked at it

2278
01:40:29,939 --> 01:40:33,658
if it was so different you know I mean

2279
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,699
so that just goes to speak to the level

2280
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:38,099
of pioneering that they were trying to

2281
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:39,839
have to figure all this stuff out the

2282
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:42,000
other part that's just a little tidbit

2283
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,119
but I found like endlessly amusing

2284
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,819
honestly is that obviously in a an

2285
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:50,158
American weed culture we can kind of

2286
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:51,960
trace a lot of strains

2287
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:54,599
um back but then there's like a nickname

2288
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:56,100
you know where nl5 skunk one doesn't

2289
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,139
stay that way it gets nicknamed

2290
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:00,539
something else sure something maybe this

2291
01:40:58,139 --> 01:41:02,940
nl5 Haze gets nicknamed dog [ __ ] or

2292
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:05,158
Electric Boogaloo or whatever yeah and

2293
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:07,859
so you know we have this whole counter

2294
01:41:05,158 --> 01:41:10,859
cultural thing in America of relating

2295
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:13,319
our strains to various pop culture stuff

2296
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:15,118
that's current for us right yeah and so

2297
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:17,698
to hear that whole story about Victor

2298
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:19,738
Barn oh yeah that was cool and the way

2299
01:41:17,698 --> 01:41:21,899
that and the way that they that who

2300
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:23,519
whose name it was and this hustle and

2301
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:25,439
how they had to have a name to deposit

2302
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,679
all these millions

2303
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:31,019
um obviously not knowing Holland you

2304
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:33,779
know culture like that yeah I never had

2305
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:36,239
any idea that that was related to

2306
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:38,158
anything like that but it does tie into

2307
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:41,959
the fact that weed people have always

2308
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:45,059
had kind of a knack to pick funny

2309
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,980
tongue-in-cheek kind of names for wheat

2310
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,539
yeah like an electric Choice he said

2311
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:50,939
that was kind of like a [ __ ] you to the

2312
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:53,340
queen of Holland that's yeah exactly so

2313
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:54,899
punk rock is that you know so yeah I

2314
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:56,279
mean so both those things both those

2315
01:41:54,899 --> 01:41:58,679
names

2316
01:41:56,279 --> 01:42:00,238
um that Traditions has continued

2317
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:02,819
throughout the decades people are always

2318
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:05,099
coming up with clever plays on the

2319
01:42:02,819 --> 01:42:07,500
culture that they're in yeah and so

2320
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:08,940
while you know Holland weed culture and

2321
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:10,560
American wheat culture is obviously

2322
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:13,259
quite different it was pretty neat to

2323
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:16,139
hear that they should we share that sort

2324
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:18,420
of you know and on top of that too I'll

2325
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:20,159
just say as a general sense uh

2326
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:22,739
everything he said about his attitude

2327
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,719
towards weed and their approach towards

2328
01:42:22,738 --> 01:42:26,399
things and all that like I pretty much

2329
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,139
agree with I mean it was obvious talking

2330
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:30,479
to him his heart was in the right place

2331
01:42:28,139 --> 01:42:31,859
they were pretty counter-cultural people

2332
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:33,658
they were trying to get away with it

2333
01:42:31,859 --> 01:42:35,279
they were trying to overgrow or change

2334
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:37,500
things yeah

2335
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:40,019
um and that was my my favorite part that

2336
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:43,020
endeared me to him was his yeah

2337
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,280
nature you know even even for I mean

2338
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:46,500
obviously there was a financial

2339
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:48,840
component for him him and people doing

2340
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:50,719
what they were doing but in a way it

2341
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:53,039
started to counter cultural revolution

2342
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:55,500
uh the reason why people are so

2343
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:58,260
interested in super sativa seed Club is

2344
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:00,658
because so many legends exist of weed

2345
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:03,360
grown in Canada and America of those

2346
01:43:00,658 --> 01:43:05,638
strains by people yeah absolutely from

2347
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:08,579
them so they played a pretty big role

2348
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:10,739
hit them and Neville are really the two

2349
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:13,800
groups that started spreading all this

2350
01:43:10,738 --> 01:43:15,238
seed everywhere yeah

2351
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,039
um and that that's pretty important

2352
01:43:15,238 --> 01:43:19,500
because they laid the foundation for

2353
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:21,060
what came after I mean it's all it was

2354
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:23,880
also interesting because we've already

2355
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:25,980
you know we we always wondered but

2356
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:28,319
hearing how when they saw what happened

2357
01:43:25,979 --> 01:43:30,118
in Neville and they saw green Merchant

2358
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:32,579
and they saw the international police

2359
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:35,579
pressure that that's what made them

2360
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:38,340
decide to disband for a long time yeah

2361
01:43:35,579 --> 01:43:39,600
and not continue because they saw you

2362
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:42,420
know the price that a lot of these

2363
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,619
pioneer years paid had to do this kind

2364
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:46,560
of stuff

2365
01:43:43,618 --> 01:43:49,380
um you know was uh was pretty intense

2366
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,480
yeah uh another thing I want to mention

2367
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:52,560
just before I forget

2368
01:43:51,479 --> 01:43:54,198
um and that this might be really

2369
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,960
pertinent because it's kind of a

2370
01:43:54,198 --> 01:43:59,759
experiencing a Resurgence but

2371
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:03,118
um you know when he was talking about

2372
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:06,719
his skunk Haze oh yeah yeah

2373
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:09,179
um so first of all that's another piece

2374
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:11,639
of of evidence that you know there was

2375
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:14,219
at least three people that seemed to get

2376
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:17,779
haze from Sam Skunk Man when he came

2377
01:44:14,219 --> 01:44:22,380
over to Holland the first time yeah

2378
01:44:17,779 --> 01:44:25,319
Neville yes and Corel correct and and

2379
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:27,779
you know they all you know their stories

2380
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:30,359
all are all similar it was interesting

2381
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:32,819
to hear that um that maybe there wasn't

2382
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:35,759
even that many Haze seeds given out

2383
01:44:32,819 --> 01:44:37,500
yeah you know uh maybe that leads to the

2384
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,960
fact that he didn't bring over that that

2385
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:41,399
many yeah and was kind of hesitant you

2386
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,380
know and only wanted to give out so many

2387
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:45,539
before he could make his own breeding

2388
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:47,219
and increase it again

2389
01:44:45,539 --> 01:44:48,359
um but if we were able to talk to him

2390
01:44:47,219 --> 01:44:49,800
about it it would it would actually

2391
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:52,738
answer a lot of questions so hopefully

2392
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,659
in the future he'd be into it yeah and

2393
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:56,279
one thing that I think for all the

2394
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:59,339
modern Haze freaks out there because

2395
01:44:56,279 --> 01:45:01,800
with the A5 and C5 sneaking out and a

2396
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:04,500
lot of people breeding Cuban black Haze

2397
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:07,860
and nl5 Haze I think is having a quite a

2398
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:09,960
bit of a Resurgence as piff or church or

2399
01:45:07,859 --> 01:45:11,759
different things like that is how he

2400
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:15,118
talked about how this skunk cage that

2401
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:18,239
they've had for 35 years if you grew it

2402
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:21,238
uh under you know in America in American

2403
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:23,218
American terms 82 degrees Yeah uh you

2404
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:25,198
know if you grew a cold it only took

2405
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:27,719
about 12 12 and a half weeks to finish

2406
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,960
and it Formed nice buds yeah but let it

2407
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:34,679
creep above 82 for even an hour or two

2408
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:38,279
and you've got a running long sativa 20

2409
01:45:34,679 --> 01:45:41,219
plus week they would add another eight

2410
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:42,779
weeks a couple months so wild man and so

2411
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:44,880
they you know it was really interesting

2412
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:47,099
to hear that because there's a lot of

2413
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,980
people playing with hazes right now sure

2414
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:52,440
and if that holds true uh I wonder if

2415
01:45:49,979 --> 01:45:54,359
people ran rooms in the low to mid 70s

2416
01:45:52,439 --> 01:45:56,158
and were militant about keeping it that

2417
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:58,618
low yeah there's a lot of people that

2418
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:00,179
run CO2 in their rooms there's a lot of

2419
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:03,539
data out there where you might run your

2420
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:06,899
room in the low to mid 80s to get VPD

2421
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:09,960
yeah you know or to to get more use out

2422
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:12,960
of your CO2 and try to Rapid Fire yeah

2423
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:15,840
and that might be the exact bad approach

2424
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:18,300
for running some of these old hazes yeah

2425
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,039
so maybe if you know people are

2426
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:22,860
listening and interested and you have

2427
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:25,439
hazes uh try running them in the low to

2428
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:26,698
mid 70s yeah and see if they form a

2429
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:28,799
little different and see if they finish

2430
01:46:26,698 --> 01:46:31,559
faster because the difference between 12

2431
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,659
and 20 weeks is a lot yeah yeah that's

2432
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:36,539
tremendous that is tremendous

2433
01:46:33,658 --> 01:46:39,000
you know so it's it's also interesting

2434
01:46:36,539 --> 01:46:41,100
in that you know maybe we can eventually

2435
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,859
get to work on some of his stuff over

2436
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:46,560
here but most people's Haze stuff comes

2437
01:46:43,859 --> 01:46:49,439
from the plants that Neville found yeah

2438
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:51,659
and so it was crazy to hear that the

2439
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:52,678
skunk Haze that he has is a Survivor

2440
01:46:51,658 --> 01:46:55,920
from

2441
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:59,118
uh Haze seed that he found yeah so it's

2442
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,118
not Haze or hey C

2443
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:04,259
it's

2444
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:07,319
another Haze that is now trapped in

2445
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:08,760
genetics that maybe could be used and a

2446
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:10,500
lot of the issues with Haze or

2447
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:13,199
inbreeding because there's only a parent

2448
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:16,319
or two yeah so when you only have a

2449
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:19,379
couple parents being used and mostly C A

2450
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:21,238
is still way more rare to even use

2451
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:23,639
um third parent

2452
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:24,359
adds a lot more genetics yeah it sure

2453
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:27,060
does

2454
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:29,039
that's a good direction and potential so

2455
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:30,900
it's pretty interesting maybe you know

2456
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:32,698
he's been talking about during that

2457
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:34,259
interview they're starting up the the

2458
01:47:32,698 --> 01:47:37,138
company again and they've got some

2459
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:39,480
initial work coming out so uh that that

2460
01:47:37,139 --> 01:47:41,279
made me quite a bit more excited yeah me

2461
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:45,238
too about anything that uses that plant

2462
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:48,658
because the other thing too relative to

2463
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:50,959
that plant is I I thought his in his

2464
01:47:48,658 --> 01:47:53,939
talk about how different skunk one was

2465
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:57,118
in the mid 80s when it first arrived

2466
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:58,678
then what it became later on yeah a lot

2467
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:00,479
of people have considered that skunk one

2468
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:04,319
has been this consistent thing and we're

2469
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:07,678
used to Citrus or grapes or uh you know

2470
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:09,179
maybe some cheese or Funk yeah uh but he

2471
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:11,520
said it was kind of rank when it came

2472
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:15,658
over so that that does I wonder if that

2473
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:18,540
holds true to to stuff that Sam Dave had

2474
01:48:15,658 --> 01:48:21,179
uh said about breeding out skunk

2475
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:23,698
bringing out the actual skunk skunky

2476
01:48:21,179 --> 01:48:25,679
smells I should say I mean there's not

2477
01:48:23,698 --> 01:48:28,859
that many people we should talk to that

2478
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,480
we're growing skunk in 1985 but yeah the

2479
01:48:28,859 --> 01:48:32,639
other interesting part about that is

2480
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:36,000
that obviously that skunk Haze that he

2481
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:38,940
talked about contains that raw more raw

2482
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,920
skunk one yeah that's in addition to a

2483
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:44,099
double and another Haze the other side

2484
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:46,560
of it is this you know

2485
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:48,480
um maybe before it was hard selected in

2486
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:50,340
that direction that we're all so

2487
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:52,198
familiar with yeah it could be like

2488
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:54,659
closer to something like an Afghan Haze

2489
01:48:52,198 --> 01:48:56,759
that could be really ranked yeah yeah I

2490
01:48:54,658 --> 01:48:58,799
mean it was it was interesting tidbit

2491
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:01,380
because you have so few people you can

2492
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:04,760
talk to about what was mid 80s skunk one

2493
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:07,260
like yeah yeah it's true it's true he

2494
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:09,239
obviously bought it and bred it and sold

2495
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:11,520
it and it was a big part of his catalog

2496
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:14,339
and the years they were in operation so

2497
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,619
uh hearing his opinion about how mid and

2498
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:19,199
late 80s skunk was vastly different than

2499
01:49:16,618 --> 01:49:20,819
what came later was to me at least

2500
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:24,059
confirmation

2501
01:49:20,819 --> 01:49:25,439
you know that uh that you know the state

2502
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:27,719
that things were in

2503
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:29,039
I thought it was it was pretty cool when

2504
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:32,039
um I think we were talking about

2505
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:33,658
Friesland Friesland Indica where he was

2506
01:49:32,039 --> 01:49:35,698
very honest and said he wasn't really

2507
01:49:33,658 --> 01:49:38,879
stoked with where he's seen freeze land

2508
01:49:35,698 --> 01:49:40,979
been taken now as as it's been grown and

2509
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,440
bred and fginned like he wasn't really

2510
01:49:40,979 --> 01:49:45,178
stoked with the current offering of

2511
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:48,479
freezeland out there

2512
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:50,940
I mean you know I I understand from his

2513
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:53,158
perspective like absolutely one thing

2514
01:49:50,939 --> 01:49:56,098
that's certainly true is with Instagram

2515
01:49:53,158 --> 01:49:58,379
and other forms going on these days is

2516
01:49:56,099 --> 01:50:00,539
that that's the way that a lot of people

2517
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:02,819
interact with a lot of cannabis they

2518
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:05,158
never get to try yeah so looks have

2519
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:08,939
become incredibly important yeah you

2520
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:11,039
know uh and you know so you you go to

2521
01:50:08,939 --> 01:50:12,118
the looks of some of those 80s and 90s

2522
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:13,679
strains

2523
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:14,880
they're pretty rough yeah there's

2524
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:16,679
something a little rough you know

2525
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,599
there's pretty pretty rough they might

2526
01:50:16,679 --> 01:50:20,099
not be the most resonance they might be

2527
01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:22,800
kind of leafy they might look kind of

2528
01:50:20,099 --> 01:50:23,760
fugly yeah put that next to like you

2529
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,500
know

2530
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,560
um some kind of very modern very

2531
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:30,658
gorgeous looking plant yeah and by looks

2532
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:32,340
alone it kind of looks like you're you

2533
01:50:30,658 --> 01:50:34,319
know you're drawn in squiggles or

2534
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:37,199
something you know it's like sure for

2535
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:40,738
sure fingers you know but but it also

2536
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:43,439
reiterates that like you can't you can't

2537
01:50:40,738 --> 01:50:46,198
just look at effect with your eyes

2538
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:48,000
exactly so it could be a super there's a

2539
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:51,118
lot of haze out there that's kind of

2540
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,760
ugly but it works really good I mean

2541
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:57,299
there's a there's there's famous Haze in

2542
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:59,280
New York that gets sold Brown yeah and

2543
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:01,920
in modern times it's not very easy to

2544
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:04,500
sell Brown wheat no but that name sells

2545
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,779
it that name it also it tastes great and

2546
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,760
it works that's true yeah so the smoke

2547
01:51:06,779 --> 01:51:11,519
is great you know the fact that it I

2548
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:14,039
mean even so you know uh you know we had

2549
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,840
this we had this cut that you know uh my

2550
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:19,679
friend helped make the the chocolate

2551
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:22,619
diesel right yeah and it and it was a

2552
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:26,340
combination of chocolate Thai across to

2553
01:51:22,618 --> 01:51:28,500
the 91 and then cross the Sardis oh yeah

2554
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:30,800
yeah it was crazy too like he it was

2555
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:34,319
legitimate old like

2556
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:37,440
80s chocolate Thai smaller than type

2557
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:39,719
stuff right and eventually it got lost

2558
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:43,559
because it was super potent it was like

2559
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:46,800
top Super Thai super chem it knocked you

2560
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:49,380
on your ass but it cured Brown yeah and

2561
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:52,320
people hated it yeah for that look that

2562
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:55,319
look uh even chem four

2563
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:57,479
um chem 4 can sometimes cure to like a

2564
01:51:55,319 --> 01:51:59,099
very light brownish it still looks the

2565
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:00,839
resin and all that and the butt itself

2566
01:51:59,099 --> 01:52:02,880
looks amazing

2567
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:04,619
um but people don't like brown the old

2568
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,179
Clockwork Orange mom was the same we

2569
01:52:04,618 --> 01:52:08,399
called it orange not because of the

2570
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:10,920
flavor but it was more because of the

2571
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:12,539
actual color of the plant when it was

2572
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,239
done you know it was more of a golden

2573
01:52:12,539 --> 01:52:16,319
orange brown look to it it was unique in

2574
01:52:15,238 --> 01:52:19,079
that sense

2575
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:21,899
but really I mean you know you you

2576
01:52:19,079 --> 01:52:24,899
talked his interview is not that much

2577
01:52:21,899 --> 01:52:27,059
different than what a lot of us have who

2578
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:28,859
have bred in various houses in various

2579
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:30,360
ways and tried to get away with it here

2580
01:52:28,859 --> 01:52:32,579
and there

2581
01:52:30,359 --> 01:52:34,139
um you know and they were just grabbing

2582
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:36,300
the best stuff they could at the time

2583
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:38,039
some of them were straight strained some

2584
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:40,260
of them were bag seeds that they found

2585
01:52:38,039 --> 01:52:42,300
out of good weed and coffee shops yeah

2586
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:45,060
which is how a lot of breeding in

2587
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:48,599
America happen too later on as well a

2588
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:51,239
bag seed uh has ruled the game for you

2589
01:52:48,599 --> 01:52:53,940
know and uh and so it's cool that things

2590
01:52:51,238 --> 01:52:56,579
are opening up uh and we can talk to

2591
01:52:53,939 --> 01:52:59,698
people like that who have such a vastly

2592
01:52:56,579 --> 01:53:01,439
different experience of starting them uh

2593
01:52:59,698 --> 01:53:03,359
yeah you know maybe we can get some more

2594
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:04,979
you know things open up a little bit

2595
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:06,779
more in America and over there there

2596
01:53:04,979 --> 01:53:09,059
could be some actual like more closer

2597
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:11,880
collaborations yeah because obviously

2598
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:14,219
there's been a lot of illicit flow back

2599
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,960
and forth between the Dutch and America

2600
01:53:14,219 --> 01:53:18,719
and Canada

2601
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:21,480
yeah but it would be neat to be able to

2602
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:23,639
one day to actually do it yeah because

2603
01:53:21,479 --> 01:53:25,500
we each have some pretty amazing things

2604
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:27,420
and we have some different lines and we

2605
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:30,539
have some things that's segregated from

2606
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:32,340
each other over time uh you know you

2607
01:53:30,539 --> 01:53:34,560
talk about him being able to go to

2608
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:36,779
Canada and there's there's some super

2609
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,119
sativa seed club stuff that still exists

2610
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:41,579
sure uh and they might be able to get it

2611
01:53:39,118 --> 01:53:42,839
back and then you know that brings me to

2612
01:53:41,579 --> 01:53:44,519
another part though was when I was

2613
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:46,139
talking to him and this might have been

2614
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:48,659
um actually a private conversation but

2615
01:53:46,139 --> 01:53:50,520
it was it was talking to him about the

2616
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:53,638
people that have made whole companies

2617
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:56,639
off of selling

2618
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:59,340
um elicit not not elicit but like unreal

2619
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,719
reproductions of super sativa C Club

2620
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:03,420
just to mark it on the name and move

2621
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:05,460
seats fast and when he was talking about

2622
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:07,980
resourcing genetics that's going to be a

2623
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:10,139
problem that is an actual issue now that

2624
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:12,779
so many people have made different super

2625
01:54:10,139 --> 01:54:14,039
sativa seed Club Repros and it's going

2626
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:16,259
to make sourcing a little harder for

2627
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:19,139
some of it well we we've talked about

2628
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:21,119
this on previous podcasts in the sense

2629
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:22,920
that uh it's really only in the last

2630
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:24,960
maybe five or six years that there's

2631
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:28,020
been a massive Resurgence in trying to

2632
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:30,060
find ancient and original beings yeah

2633
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:33,540
there was a big era where everybody

2634
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:36,000
wanted new new yes uh and the old stuff

2635
01:54:33,539 --> 01:54:39,359
was most of the stories were pretty

2636
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,060
honest because nobody cared yeah exactly

2637
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,618
how now that things have legalized and

2638
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:46,199
things have opened up and lots of people

2639
01:54:43,618 --> 01:54:49,380
have kind of the same things uh there's

2640
01:54:46,198 --> 01:54:51,539
been this massive explosion of I found

2641
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:54,900
these seeds and my old connections

2642
01:54:51,539 --> 01:54:56,658
dresser like Grandma's freezer my this

2643
01:54:54,899 --> 01:55:00,719
my that these have been Faithfully

2644
01:54:56,658 --> 01:55:03,658
reproduced and not just sssc but every

2645
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:05,639
old legendary line you can think of

2646
01:55:03,658 --> 01:55:09,420
there's dates associated with them some

2647
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:12,000
of them are super early too early yeah

2648
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:15,179
it makes it really hard to sift through

2649
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,819
yeah um and find the real

2650
01:55:15,179 --> 01:55:19,679
um because there's there as people get

2651
01:55:17,819 --> 01:55:21,840
more excited about weed and people get

2652
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:24,060
more excited about the history and stuff

2653
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,500
they're gonna just they're gonna want

2654
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:28,800
just like we do they're going to want to

2655
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:30,840
try some old pure lines yeah I would

2656
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:35,279
love to dig through everything from the

2657
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:37,020
seed bank and sssc uh now being my age

2658
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:39,599
and knowing what I know now it would be

2659
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:41,880
amazing to dig through all that uh and

2660
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,440
so and so people pray it's you know it's

2661
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:45,539
kind of like the roadkill skunk thing

2662
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:48,719
where uh there's a there's a market

2663
01:55:45,539 --> 01:55:51,179
demand for certain things now and so

2664
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:53,520
there's a market demand for old yeah so

2665
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:55,560
hopefully some of his old stuff

2666
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:58,219
legitimately did exist

2667
01:55:55,560 --> 01:56:00,119
yeah um but I know I know a few

2668
01:55:58,219 --> 01:56:02,579
reproductions are out there that that

2669
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:06,118
are legitimate for some of them but it

2670
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:08,158
just goes to to say that it's cool that

2671
01:56:06,118 --> 01:56:11,039
that people are getting so into

2672
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:13,618
researching cannabis to the point of

2673
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:17,039
really getting into provenance and stuff

2674
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:19,019
like that so it combats that because if

2675
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:20,158
stuff like that doesn't sell if these if

2676
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:22,199
these guys who are doing these

2677
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:24,059
reproductions that you're it's pretty

2678
01:56:22,198 --> 01:56:25,759
obvious usually when these guys are

2679
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,440
working their games

2680
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:31,380
it might be obvious to us it might be

2681
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:34,738
less obvious to others depending on you

2682
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:36,900
know uh how how in tune your scam Dar is

2683
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:39,419
or whatever but that's true I do think

2684
01:56:36,899 --> 01:56:41,460
that for most people you know there's a

2685
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:43,618
lot of strains I'll be frank like I went

2686
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:46,020
to a lot of Amsterdam trips I bought a

2687
01:56:43,618 --> 01:56:48,899
lot of seed uh most of it was not

2688
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:51,300
Keepers yeah I did find some cool stuff

2689
01:56:48,899 --> 01:56:53,638
certainly others found some Elites that

2690
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:56,219
have survived to this day off the same

2691
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:57,840
lines that I bought yeah back then it

2692
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:59,658
was a total crap shoot and there was

2693
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:02,579
there was a lot to not be impressed by

2694
01:56:59,658 --> 01:57:04,439
so uh you know him looking and being

2695
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:06,960
honest and being like Oh the free Sunday

2696
01:57:04,439 --> 01:57:10,019
wasn't it's not so nice yeah

2697
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,840
um but still if it is real the cool part

2698
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:15,540
about it is is that opening up the gene

2699
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:18,239
pool and adding genes that have been

2700
01:57:15,539 --> 01:57:21,238
lost over time and aren't being used we

2701
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:24,000
have too much overuse yeah of too few

2702
01:57:21,238 --> 01:57:26,399
lines in cannabis right now so a lot of

2703
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,439
80s and old things by themselves might

2704
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:30,359
not be all that great but they could

2705
01:57:28,439 --> 01:57:32,098
widen the gene pool and you never know

2706
01:57:30,359 --> 01:57:34,859
what they might pop in out crosses

2707
01:57:32,099 --> 01:57:38,159
absolutely uh you know for we you know

2708
01:57:34,859 --> 01:57:40,859
we just uh you know CSI who knows where

2709
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:42,779
the ABC work will go yeah uh that's

2710
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:44,759
still in its infancy as you start

2711
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:46,859
hybridizing it with things and adding

2712
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:49,440
those genes in and making poly hybrids

2713
01:57:46,859 --> 01:57:51,479
with it so to me some of the most value

2714
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:54,178
if anything from the 80s or early 90s

2715
01:57:51,479 --> 01:57:56,879
survived even if by itself it's not that

2716
01:57:54,179 --> 01:57:58,260
great uh it might might have traits or

2717
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,599
things that you add into something

2718
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:02,820
really inbred yeah and you get something

2719
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:04,920
surprising yeah you never know how

2720
01:58:02,819 --> 01:58:07,559
terpenes will modify other terpenes or

2721
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:09,899
dialic Expressions you never know and

2722
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:11,940
with new and novel expressions or maybe

2723
01:58:09,899 --> 01:58:13,799
they weren't new in novel in the 80s but

2724
01:58:11,939 --> 01:58:15,419
they're back to being new and novel now

2725
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:17,699
and that we never know how that'll

2726
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:19,319
change and modify snow and you know one

2727
01:58:17,698 --> 01:58:20,759
of the things about breeding is you tend

2728
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:23,158
to get good results when you cross

2729
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,599
things that that are very dissimilar to

2730
01:58:23,158 --> 01:58:26,638
each other yeah

2731
01:58:24,599 --> 01:58:28,500
um and so taking something that hasn't

2732
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,719
been really worked with much since the

2733
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:32,899
80s or early 90s and isn't in a lot of

2734
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:36,658
this cush Skittles cookies whatever

2735
01:58:32,899 --> 01:58:39,598
blends of things it might pop some new

2736
01:58:36,658 --> 01:58:42,059
and cool things in that regard so

2737
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:44,940
you know all in all uh I thought he was

2738
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:47,039
a wealth of information absolutely super

2739
01:58:44,939 --> 01:58:51,000
engaging and pleasant he seemed like an

2740
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:53,219
older version of us yeah you know he did

2741
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,779
so that made it like really fun and

2742
01:58:53,219 --> 01:58:57,539
relaxing to chat with him about

2743
01:58:54,779 --> 01:58:59,579
everything sure um he seems willing to

2744
01:58:57,539 --> 01:59:02,219
maybe do some more and so there's I'm

2745
01:58:59,579 --> 01:59:04,920
sure there's a lot of history uh and

2746
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:07,618
experiences that he's seen uh that's

2747
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:09,420
right up our alley so you know no

2748
01:59:07,618 --> 01:59:11,819
promises but we'll see what comes of it

2749
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:13,440
yeah uh and in closing yeah I think I

2750
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:15,179
think we learned a lot I think there was

2751
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:18,178
a lot of things that weren't very well

2752
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:19,980
publicly known that he clarified and so

2753
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:23,940
not only from a historical perspective

2754
01:59:19,979 --> 01:59:25,379
but for the current uh I think it was it

2755
01:59:23,939 --> 01:59:26,698
was really a it was really a good

2756
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:29,699
interview

2757
01:59:26,698 --> 01:59:29,698
