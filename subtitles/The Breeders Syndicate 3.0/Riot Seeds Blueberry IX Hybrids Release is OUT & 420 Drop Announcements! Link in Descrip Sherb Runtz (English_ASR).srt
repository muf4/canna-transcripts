1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,399
hey what's up everyone um I just wanted

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:08,320
to give a quick quick video about uh

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,000
some of the new blue drops we have

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,080
coming out so some of you know I've been

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,240
working on the blue bonnet stuff for

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,439
around five years now and one of my main

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:25,159
goals in doing all this was to go

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,560
through DJ shorts full Supply and mass

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,439
uh some of the hybrids made with some of

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:34,039
this stuff and to kind of find out what

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,238
the true best blueberry was and when I

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,399
say blueberry I don't just mean the

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,479
strain I mean something that looks as

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,879
beautiful as DJ shortz blueberries

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:49,398
looked in his photography over the years

16
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:53,759
since the 90s as well as having extreme

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,359
blueberry turps now there's blueberry

18
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,198
jam there's all sorts of artificial

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,280
blueberry smells that are so strong they

20
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:05,118
can overpower OG Kush in a room any kind

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,840
of dank anything you have going on they

22
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:11,719
should be able to overpower it so it

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,640
took about five years to perfect a seed

24
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:18,118
line that I felt best represented it and

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,000
uh I feel like we've made it I feel like

26
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,280
I feel like it's in seed form now I feel

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,879
comfortable saying that feel comfortable

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,840
telling people that every pack you can

29
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:31,519
find multiple different expressions of

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,359
like blueberry slushy blueberry candy

31
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,920
blueberry bubblegum blueberry you know

32
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:41,680
Jam blueberry compot you know like all

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,478
sorts of blueberry and uh from there we

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,040
decided while we were doing this last

35
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,200
line to include some of the more modern

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,840
lines that I'd been ignoring for many

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,920
years um one of my good friends spindle

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,079
uh had some really really dank modern

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,039
lines that he's been you know selling a

40
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,399
flower of that of his fan base enjoys

41
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,560
and that he in turn as a blueberry fiend

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,959
has enjoyed as well so uh we took in

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,719
some sherb cream pie I don't know who

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,080
that's from or exactly what's in it but

45
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:19,280
it's so Sherby it's so Frosty great calx

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,560
to Leaf ratio not seeing any mold in any

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,598
of it and we crossed that to the the

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,280
blueberry incross and uh we're calling

49
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,119
that blue cocky because you know cream

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,439
pie blue

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,840
cocky just kind of fit shout out to

52
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,280
Farmer Dan for that [ __ ] beautiful

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,239
name um um so we know that there's lines

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,400
out there called Blue runs blue Zushi

55
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,080
all this other stuff um I got to smoke a

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,840
bunch of white runs early on and I

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,040
thought it was pretty decent for what it

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,640
was so in this run we decided to add

59
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:02,359
white runs and make a true blueberry

60
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:05,079
runs like let's make a c strain of blue

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,080
and something that appeals to the masses

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,480
because the overall idea like I've been

63
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,840
I've been very much against isolating

64
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,318
myself from the cookie crowd the sherb

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,680
crowd the gelato crowd um I've dabbled

66
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:20,119
in it but I haven't really fully reached

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,959
into it and in order to do what we need

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,120
to do to uh to bring the younger

69
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,199
generation into understanding genetics

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,080
we need to tap into that and uh I felt

71
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,518
that the blueberry incross into like a

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,159
white runs would be an excellent way of

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,000
doing that showing that you can breed

74
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:44,399
you can breed lines that have these true

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,039
blueberry turps cross them into

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,719
something and make them something unique

77
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,000
you don't just need to smash like into

78
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:56,079
like into like into like and take the

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,079
easy R um and the last one is uh the

80
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,719
trop Berry now dosy do out of all the

81
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,319
cookies cross I think um archive

82
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,598
probably nailed it the best with Dosey

83
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,759
Do there's been some really really good

84
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,000
stuff coming out of Dosey Do nonstop um

85
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,759
another line that I've really liked uh

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,560
tur wise was the trop cherry and I had a

87
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,959
chance to have a uh trop Cherry Dosey

88
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,839
dose and that also made it into the

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,519
blueberry in cross

90
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:28,679
line it'll combine insanely well um I

91
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,519
really hope you guys enjoy what you get

92
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,160
but overall my my main purpose is the

93
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,560
blueberry

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,560
incross I made a lot of them um there's

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,199
actually a blue candy

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
direction there's a blueberry jam

97
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,720
Direction and then there's more of the

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,478
blueberry kush Direction so it's heavy

99
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,080
heavy blueberry jam with some of the

100
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:56,680
Kush nuances of the earthy cushy type uh

101
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,758
expression so there's something for

102
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,519
everyone in there it's currently

103
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,919
available a bunch of them have already

104
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,799
been shipped from the pre-orders um

105
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:09,079
pre-orders got the best price however if

106
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,000
you're a part of our patreon you get 30%

107
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:16,198
off each pack when you order um it cost

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,360
$5 a month to join our patreon and that

109
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,720
usually is there to keep the trolls out

110
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,400
and stand done a damn good job and when

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,919
they do sneak in they still get booted

112
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,719
pretty fast because you guys know how I

113
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:32,318
roll you know like no tolerance for

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,720
[ __ ] anyways um yeah go check that

115
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,319
out in uh 420 I've got some great

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,360
announcements we have Matt Elite joining

117
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,960
us finally with some of his I95 work I

118
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,960
know a lot of you are looking for OG

119
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,198
cush and C form um as far as regular

120
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,560
seeds go I don't think anybody's done

121
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,160
better than Mite and I can say that

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,360
wholeheartedly um his chem lines as far

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,639
as regular lines go nothing beats it

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,720
nothing has come even close his

125
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,199
resurrection line I feel like was the

126
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,800
epitome of chem

127
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,960
91 and everything chem 90 was c91 was

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,038
when they originally popped that seed I

129
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:19,879
get I finally get why that line and cut

130
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,038
was held for so long and so popular once

131
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,000
I smoked that um we're going to have

132
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:27,519
some Resurrection stuff in there uh sfv

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,079
cross to chmd

134
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:37,439
I95 headband I camd I95 snow dog camd

135
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:42,560
I95 East Coast Sour Diesel camd I95 it's

136
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:46,519
it's it's a plethora of riches on top of

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,079
that for tiva heads because there it's

138
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,680
it's a growing contingent people are

139
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,038
finally getting that like longer

140
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,038
flowering strains can be just as dank as

141
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:58,318
any um the high is what matters to a lot

142
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,038
of us you know like it's not just the

143
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
hype not just the name and and hopes

144
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,639
that we're smoking what all these other

145
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,399
people are talking about and he has a

146
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,598
bunch of mango hay stuff dropping and in

147
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,918
my opinion um Shanty Baba's work was

148
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,680
pinnacled by mango Hayes and uh

149
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,439
Neville's work was was obviously

150
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,038
Neville's Hayes but I think mango Hayes

151
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,478
is a is a worthy competitor and uh yeah

152
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,759
and with people who buy two packs of

153
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,199
that you can also get some Shoreline

154
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:34,280
cross to Vietnam Black and the

155
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:37,720
cough so there's a lot of opportunities

156
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,038
for some really really dank stuff um Bas

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,879
lines for other breeders to work into

158
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,279
their own work which a lot of us breed

159
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,520
for breeders I feel like what I do is

160
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,839
breeding for breeders much less so than

161
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,799
commercial croppers though it does work

162
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:56,359
for both um there's nothing

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,158
better than being someone who breeds for

164
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,520
breeders though in my mind like that's

165
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,478
the biggest accomplishments so anyway I

166
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,038
just wanted to take a moment to uh let

167
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,918
you guys all know about this stuff um

168
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,918
it's up it's already shipping it ships

169
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,079
pretty fast because it's all packaged up

170
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,598
ready to rock so um yeah be a part of

171
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:19,519
the blueberry Revolution before it's

172
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:22,240
gone because it will be gone and um

173
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,439
because this iteration I feel is the

174
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,639
Pinnacle of what I've done it may be

175
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,079
where I move on from blueberry finally

176
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,639
after the past five years even though

177
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,038
that's like been my life uh my life goal

178
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:40,439
to to leave something behind that was

179
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:42,278
better than what I started with and uh

180
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,120
yeah I mean that's our motto you know

181
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:48,480
leave the plant better better than you
